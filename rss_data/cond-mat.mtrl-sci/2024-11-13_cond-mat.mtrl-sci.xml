      <title>Modeling Extensive Defects in Metals through Active Machine Learning and Automated Configuration Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended defects such as dislocation networks and complex grain boundaries are ubiquitous in metals, and accurately modeling these extensive defects is crucial for understanding their deformation mechanisms. Existing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often fall short in adequately describing these defects, as their significant characteristic sizes exceed the computational limits of first-principles calculations. To address these challenges, this study constructs a comprehensive defect genome, derived through active machine learning from classical empirical potentials, and augmented by conventional on-the-fly active learning. Additionally, we have developed a approach for transforming defect atomic clusters into periodic configurations via precise atom insertion, using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. These strategies enable the development of highly accurate and transferable MLIPs for modeling extensive defects in metals. Using body-centered cubic tungsten as a model system, we develop an MLIP that reveals previously undocumented plastic mechanisms in simulations of nanoindentation and dislocation-grain boundary interactions. This framework not only improves the modeling accuracy of extensive defects in crystalline materials but also establishes a robust foundation for further advancement of MLIP development through the strategic use of defect genomes.</description>

      <title>Defect formation in CsSnI$_3$ from Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sn-based perovskites as low-toxic materials are actively studied for optoelectronic applications. However, their performance is limited by $p$-type self-doping, which can be suppressed by substitutional doping on the cation sites. In this study, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning (ML) to develop a predictive model and identify the key descriptors affecting formation energy and charge transition levels of the substitutional dopants in CsSnI$_{3}$. Our DFT calculations create a dataset of formation energies and charge transition levels and show that Y, Sc, Al, Nb, Ba, and Sr are effective dopants that pin the fermi level higher in the band gap, suppressing the $p$-type self-doping. We explore ML algorithms and propose training the random forest regression model to predict the defect formation properties. This work shows the predictive capability of combining DFT with machine learning and provides insights into the important features that determine the defect formation energetics.</description>

      <title>Non-stoichiometry in SnS: How it affects thin-film morphology and electrical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tin sulfide (SnS) has garnered much attention as a promising material for various applications, including solar cells and thermoelectric devices, owing to its favorable optical and electronic properties and the abundant and nontoxic nature of its constituent elements. Herein, we investigated the effect of non-stoichiometry on the morphology and electrical properties of SnS thin films. Using a unique sputtering technique with a sulfur plasma supply, SnS films with precise sulfur content control, [S]/([Sn] + [S]) (xS) ranging from 0.47 to 0.51, were fabricated. Systematic characterization revealed that non-stoichiometry on the S-rich side led to a marked increase in the carrier density of p-type conduction, which was attributed to the formation of intrinsic acceptor-type defects. In contrast, non-stoichiometry on the S-poor side hardly affects the p-type electrical properties, apparently because of the self-compensation between the intrinsic acceptor- and donor-type defects. In addition, non-stoichiometry has been identified as the cause of thin-film morphological changes, with non-stoichiometric films exhibiting rough and porous surfaces. Achieving a stoichiometric composition results in smooth and dense thin-film morphologies, which are crucial for optimizing SnS thin films for device applications. These findings underscore the importance of compositional control for tailoring the morphology and electrical behavior of SnS, paving the way for more efficient SnS-based devices.</description>

      <title>Terahertz control of surface topology probed with subatomic resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-induced phase transitions offer a method to dynamically modulate topological states in bulk complex materials. Yet, next-generation devices demand nanoscale architectures with contact resistances near the quantum limit and precise control over local electronic properties. The layered material WTe$_2$ has gained attention as a likely Weyl semimetal, with topologically protected linear electronic band crossings hosting massless chiral fermions. Here, we demonstrate a topological phase transition facilitated by light-induced shear motion of a single atomic layer at the surface of bulk WTe$_2$, thereby opening the door to nanoscale device concepts. Ultrafast terahertz fields enhanced at the apex of an atomically sharp tip resonantly couple to the key interlayer shear mode of WTe$_2$ via a ferroelectric dipole at the interface, inducing a structural phase transition at the surface to a metastable state. Subatomically resolved differential imaging, combined with hybrid-level density functional theory, reveals a shift of 7 $\pm$ 3 picometres in the top atomic plane. Tunnelling spectroscopy links electronic changes across the phase transition with the electron and hole pockets in the band structure, suggesting a reversible, light-induced annihilation of the topologically-protected Fermi arc surface states in the top atomic layer.</description>

      <title>Slow, Nanometer Light Confinement Observed in Atomically Thin TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme light confinement down to the atomic scale has been theoretically predicted for ultrathin, Ta-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, we demonstrate in free-hanging 2H-TaS2 monolayers and bilayers slow light behaviour with a group velocity ~ $10^{-4}c$ and a lateral confinement ratio up to 300 at large wave vectors of $q = 0.15 \, \text{{\r{A}}}^{-1}$. Quantitative momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with an unprecedented momentum resolution of $0.0036 \, \text{{\r{A}}}^{-1}$ was used as a nanoscale optical platform. With it, momentum-dispersed, two-dimensional (2D) plasmon resonances were experimentally observed, showing a transition from 2D to 3D Coulomb interaction in the high-momentum regime, equivalent to light confinement volumes of $1\text{-}2 \, \text{nm}^3$. Remarkably, the resonant modes do not enter the electron-hole continuum, predicting even more enhanced optical field confinements for this material at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Effect of Sr on the Ionic Conductivity of Ta Doped Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solid electrolyte having the ionic conductivity comparable to that of the conventional liquid electrolyte can be used in All Solid State Batteries. The series Li6.75+xLa3-xSrxZr1.75Ta0.25O12 (x = 0 to 0.20) was synthesized to improve the ionic conductivity of garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). The structural, physical and morphological investigations have been carried out for all the synthesized samples using X ray diffraction, density measurement and scanning electron microscopy respectively. The results of electrochemical analysis showed that the maximum room temperature ionic conductivity of 3.5 x 10-4 S/Cm and minimum activation energy of 0.29 eV is achieved by the 0.05 Sr ceramic sample. The DC conductivity measurement confirmed the dominance of ionic conduction in the prepared ceramic samples. The highest ionic conductivity with the minimum activation energy makes the 0.05 Sr ceramic sample a suitable choice as solid electrolyte for All Solid State Lithium Ion Batteries.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize ferromagnetic semiconductors with high Curie temperature TC is still a challenge in spintronics. Recent experiments have obtained two-dimensional (2D) room temperature ferromagnetic metals, such as monolayers MnSe2 and Cr3Te6. In this paper, by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we proposed a way to obtain 2D high TC ferromagnetic semiconductors through element replacement in these ferromagnetic metals. High TC ferromagnetic semiconductors are predicted in the monolayers (Mn, D)Se2 and (Cr, D)3Te6, where element D is taken as vacancy, 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal elements. For the concentrations of D from 1/9 to 1/3, there are about 10 ferromagnetic semiconductors with TC above 200 K, including (Cr5/6, W1/6)3Te6 and (Cr4/6, Mo2/6)3Te6 with TC above 300 K. In addition, Mn(Se6/8, Sb2/8)2 is also predicted to be a 2D ferromagnetic semiconductor with TC above 300 K. Considering the fast developments on fabrication and manipulation of 2D materials, our theoretical results propose a way to explore the high temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors from experimentally obtained 2D high temperature ferromagnetic metals through element replacement approach.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast laser driven ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic skyrmion switching in 2D topological magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-spin coupling is an attractive phenomenon from the standpoints of fundamental physics and device applications, and has spurred rapid development recently. Whereas the current efforts are devoted to trivial magnetism, the interplay between light and nontrivial spin properties of topological magnetism is little known. Here, using first principles, rt-TDDFT and atomic spin simulations, we explore the evaluation of topological spin properties of monolayer CrInSe3 under laser, establishing the ultrafast ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic skyrmion reversal. The physics correlates to the laser-induced significant spin-selective charge transfer, demagnetization, and time-dependent magnetic interactions. Especially, an essential switching from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic exchange is generated under light irradiation. More importantly, dynamics of topological magnetic physics shows that this process accompanies with the evaluation of topological magnetism from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, manifesting intriguing interplay between light and topological spin properties. Our letter provides a novel approach toward the highly desired ultrafast control of topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Periodic phase diagrams in micromagnetics with an eigenvalue solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to compute periodic phase diagram of micromagnetic systems by solving a periodic linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation using an eigenvalue solver with the Finite Element Method formalism. The linear operator in the eigenvalue problem is defined as a function of the periodic phase shift wave vector. The dispersion diagrams are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for complex eigen frequencies and corresponding eigen states for a range of prescribed wave vectors. The presented approach incorporates a calculation of the periodic effective field, including the exchange and magnetostatic field components. The approach is general in that it allows handling 3D problems with any 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities. The ability to calculated periodic diagrams provides insights into the spin wave propagation and localized resonances in complex micromagnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Observation of Moire potential in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers by Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moire superlattices (MSLs) are an emerging class of two-dimensional materials whose electronic states can be tuned by the twist angle between two van der Waals layers and/or the relative placement of the layers. As the twist angle increases (decreases), the resulting MSLs tend to have a shorter (longer) wavelength pattern with in general incommensurate (com-mensurate) patterns, forming an underlying moir\'e potential depending on the twist angle. Irrespective of the commensura-bility/ incommensurability of MSLs, atomic-scale observation of the moir\'e potential is quite challenging, and the details of their interlayer interactions and the related anomalous effects such as correlated superconductivity and anomalous quan-tum Hall effects are still elusive. In this work, we show that aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy allows us to obtain atomic-scale image of the moir\'e potentials both in the commensurate and incommensurate states. For this pur-pose, we use atomically clean and strain-free hexagonal boron nitride nanolayers, which are fabricated by a chemical exfo-liation method developed especially in this work. Even in the case of incommensurate state, the local interlayer atomic overlap plays a decisive role in determining the resulting moir\'e potentials, as supported by density functional theory calcu-lations. This work not only provides a general strategy to observe the moir\'e potential in MSLs, but it also expands the ap-plication of electron microcopy to the further study of MSLs with atomic resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport in nanostructures plays a critical role in modern technologies. As devices shrink, techniques that can measure thermal properties at nanometer and nanosecond scales are increasingly needed to capture transient, out-of-equilibrium phenomena. We present a novel pump-probe photon-electron method within a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map temperature dynamics with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. By combining focused laser-induced heating and synchronized time-resolved monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we track phonon, exciton and plasmon signals in various materials, including silicon nitride, aluminum thin film, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results demonstrate the technique's ability to follow temperature changes at the nanometer and nanosecond scales. The experimental data closely matched theoretical heat diffusion models, confirming the method's validity. This approach opens new opportunities to investigate transient thermal phenomena in nanoscale materials, offering valuable insights for applications in thermoelectric devices and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supramolecular gels are formed by the self-assembly of low molecular weight organic gelators with their solvent molecules. These are emerging novel materials with good semiconducting and light emitting properties with application potential as hole and electron transport layers in organic solar cells, LEDs, stimulus-responsive smart semiconducting materials, thin film transistors (TFT) etc. In this context charge transport and mobility of charge carriers in these materials assume extreme significance. In the study, Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which is a non-destructive technique, is used to analyze frequency dependent electrochemical impedance values, of a novel meallogel, ZnA_CA (Zinc Acetate_Citric Acid), and used to evaluate the charge properties and mobility. A comparative study of mobility values obtained from diode I-V characteristics of the gel and Impedance measurements has also been made.</description>

      <title>API Phonons: Python Interfaces for Phonon Transport Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: API Phonons is a Python software package to predict the transport dynamics of heat-carrying phonons. Using the powerful syntax of Python, this package provides modules and functions interfacing between different packages for atomistic simulations, lattice dynamics, and phonon-phonon interaction calculations including LAMMPS, Quippy, Phonopy, and ShengBTE. API Phonons enabled complex phonon calculations, including (1) extracting harmonic and anharmonic force constants from arbitrary interatomic potentials, which can be used as inputs for solving Boltzmann transport equations; (2) predicting thermal conductivity using Kubo's linear response theory, which captures both quasiparticle transport and inter-band coherent transport; and (3) modeling of ultrafast pump-probe thermal responses using a Green's function approach based on mode-resolved phonon properties for studying ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport dynamics. The package provides a flexible, easy-to-use, and extensive platform for modeling phonon transport physics through Python programming.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale study on core-shell Cu precipitation in steels: atom probe tomography and ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work investigates the atomic interactions among Cu, Al, and Ni elements in bcc-iron matrix, focusing on the formation mechanism of nano-sized core-shell Cu precipitates. Using a combination of atom probe tomography (APT), density functional theory (DFT) cal-culations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the study provides insights into the atomic-scale migration tendencies of these elements in the supersaturated solid solution sur-rounding Cu precipitate in the martensite phase of a medium-Mn steel. The results show that Ni and Al atoms were not expelled by Cu atoms but were instead attracted to the bcc iron matrix, forming a stable co-segregation in the outer shell. This phase effectively surrounded the nano-sized Cu precipitate and prevented its rapid growth, contributing to improved me-chanical properties. The findings offer a theoretical method for developing Cu-contaminated circular steels by utilizing DFT calculations to unravel bonding preferences and assess the po-tential for forming a stable precipitation phase around nano-sized Cu precipitates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [Ji et al., PRL 2023]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity framework can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. Furthermore, 3D simulations demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Predicting Ti-Al Binary Phase Diagram with an Artificial Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microstructure of the Ti-Al binary system is an area of great interest as it affects material properties and plasticity. Phase transformations induce microstructural changes; therefore, accurately modeling the phase transformations of the Ti-Al system is necessary to describe plasticity. Interatomic potentials can be a powerful tool to model how materials behave; however, existing potentials lack accuracy in certain aspects. While classical potentials like the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) perform adequately for modeling dilute Al solute within Ti's $\alpha$ phase, they struggle with accurately predicting plasiticity. In particular, they struggle with stacking fault energies in intermetallics and to some extent elastic properties. This hinders their effectiveness in investigating the plastic behavior of formed intermetallics in Ti-Al alloys. Classical potentials also fail to predict the $\alpha$ to $\beta$ phase boundary. Existing machine learning (ML) potentials reproduce the properties of formed intermetallics with density functional theory (DFT) but do not examine the $\alpha$ to $\beta$ or $\alpha$ to D0$_{19}$ phase boundaries. This work uses a rapid artificial neural network (RANN) framework to produce a neural network potential for the Ti-Al binary system. This potential is capable of reproducing the Ti-Al binary phase diagram up to 50$\%$ Al concentration. The present interatomic potential ensures stability and allows results near the accuracy of DFT. Using Monte Carlo simulations, RANN potential accurately predicts the $\alpha$ to $\beta$ and $\alpha$ to D0$_{19}$ phase transitions. The current potential also exhibits accurate elastic constants and stacking fault energies for the L1$_0$ and D0$_{19}$ phases.</description>

      <title>Influence of Photoemission Geometry on Timing and Efficiency in 4D Ultrafast Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broader adoption of 4D ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) for the study of chemical, materials, and quantum systems is being driven by development of new instruments as well as continuous improvement and characterization of existing technologies. Perhaps owing to the still-high barrier to entry, the full range of capabilities of laser-driven 4D UEM instruments has yet to be established, particularly when operated at extremely low beam currents (~fA). Accordingly, with an eye on beam stability, we have conducted particle tracing simulations of unconventional off-axis photoemission geometries in a UEM equipped with a thermionic-emission gun. Specifically, we have explored the impact of experimentally adjustable parameters on the time-of-flight (TOF), the collection efficiency (CE), and the temporal width of ultrashort photoelectron packets. The adjustable parameters include the Wehnelt aperture diameter (DW), the cathode set-back position (Ztip), and the position of the femtosecond laser on the Wehnelt aperture surface relative to the optic axis (Rphoto). Notable findings include significant sensitivity of TOF to DW and Ztip, as well as non-intuitive responses of CE and temporal width to varying Rphoto. As a means to improve accessibility, practical implications and recommendations are emphasized wherever possible.</description>

      <title>Diverse Manifestations of Electron-Phonon Coupling in a Kagome Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on a kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ revealed distinct multimodal dispersion kinks and nodeless superconducting gaps across multiple electron bands. The prominent photoemission kinks suggest a definitive coupling between electrons and certain collective modes, yet the precise nature of this interaction and its connection to superconductivity remain to be established. Here, employing the state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} many-body perturbation theory computation, we present direct evidence that electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling induces the multimodal photoemission kinks in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and profoundly, drives the nodeless $s$-wave superconductivity, showcasing the diverse manifestations of the $e$-ph coupling. Our calculations well capture the experimentally measured kinks and their fine structures, and reveal that vibrations from different atomic species dictate the multimodal behavior. Results from anisotropic $GW$-Eliashberg equations predict a phonon-mediated superconductivity with nodeless $s$-wave gaps, in excellent agreement with various ARPES and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Despite of the universal origin from the $e$-ph coupling, the contributions of several characteristic phonon vibrations vary in different phenomena, highlighting a versatile role of $e$-ph coupling in shaping the low-energy excitations of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Ising superconductivity in the bulk incommensurate layered material (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS$_2$. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.
  This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the $k_{\perp}$ direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS$_2$ layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.
  Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.
  These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Skew Scattering Mechanism in Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unveil a new mechanism of nonreciprocal magneto-transport from cooperative action of Lorentz force and skew scattering. The significance of this Lorentz skew scattering mechanism lies in that it dominates both longitudinal and transverse responses in highly conductive systems, and it exhibits a scaling behavior distinct from all known mechanisms. At low temperature, it shows a cubic scaling in linear conductivity, whereas the scaling becomes quartic at elevated temperature when phonon scattering kicks in. We develop its microscopic formulation and reveal its close connection with Berry curvature on Fermi surface. Applying our theory to surface transport in topological crystalline insulator SnTe and bulk transport in Weyl semimetals leads to significant results, suggesting a new route to achieve giant transport nonreciprocity in high-mobility materials with topological band features.</description>

      <title>Rate- and temperature-dependent strain hardening in glassy polymers: Micromechanisms and constitutive modeling based on molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform molecular dynamics simulations under uniaxial tension to investigate the micromechanisms underlying strain hardening in glassy polymers. By decomposing the stress into virial components associated with pair, bond, and angle interactions, we identify the primary contributors to strain hardening as the stretching of polymer bonds. Interestingly, rather than the average bond stretch, we find that the key contributions to stress response come from a subset of bonds at the upper tail of the stretch distribution. Our results demonstrate that the stress in the hardening region can be correlated with the average stretch of the most extended bonds in each polymer chain, independent of temperatures and strain rates. These bonds, which we denote as load-bearing bonds, allow us to define a local load-bearing deformation gradient in continuum mechanics that captures their contribution to the hardening stress tensor. Building on this insight, we incorporate the load-bearing mechanism into a constitutive framework with orientation-induced back stress, developing a model that accurately reproduces the stress response of the molecular systems over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates in their glassy state.</description>

      <title>Competing mechanisms of dominant radiative and Auger recombination in hot carrier generation in III-V semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional structures such as nanowires (NWs) show great promise in tailoring the rates of hot carrier thermalization in semiconductors with important implications for the design of efficient hot carrier absorbers. However, fabrication of high-quality, phase-pure crystal structures and control of their intrinsic electronic properties can be challenging, raising concerns about the role of competing radiative and non-radiative recombination mechanisms that govern hot carrier effects. Here, we elucidate the impact of crystal purity and altered electronic properties on the hot carrier properties by comparing two classes of III-V semiconductor NW arrays with similar band-gap energies and geometries, yet different crystal quality: one composed of GaAsSb NWs, free of planar stacking defects, and the other InGaAs NWs with a high density of stacking defects. Photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrates distinct hot carrier effects in both NW arrays; however, the InGaAs NWs with lower crystal quality exhibit stronger hot carrier effects, as evidenced by increased carrier temperature under identical photoabsorptivity. This difference arises from higher rates of Auger recombination in the InGaAs NWs due to their increased n-type conductivity, as confirmed by excitation power-dependent measurements. Our findings suggest that while enhancing material properties is crucial for improving the performance of hot carrier absorbers, optimizing conditions to increase the rates of Auger recombination will further boost the efficiency of these devices.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e amplification of highly tunable shift current response in twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the shift current conductivity in helical twisted trilayer graphene. Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order $10^4~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order $10^5~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moir\'e heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Estimation of spin-orbit torques in the presence of current-induced magnon creation and annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive set of harmonic resistance measurements of the dampinglike (DL) and fieldlike (FL) torques in Pt/CoFeB, Pt/Co, W/CoFeB, W/Co, and YIG/Pt bilayers complemented by measurements of the DL torque using the magneto-optical Kerr effect and calibrated by nitrogen vacancy magnetometry on the same devices. The magnon creation-annihilation magnetoresistances depend strongly on temperature and on the magnetic and transport properties of each bilayer, affecting the estimate of both the DL and FL torque. The DL torque, the most important parameter for applications, is overestimated by a factor of 2 in W/CoFeB and by one order of magnitude in YIG/Pt when not accounting for the magnonic contribution to the planar Hall resistance. We further show that the magnonic contribution can be quantified by combining measurements of the nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances, thus providing a reliable method to measure the spin-orbit torques in different material systems.</description>

      <title>Degradation mode estimation using reconstructed open circuit voltage curves from multi-year home storage field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A battery's open circuit voltage (OCV) curve can be seen as its electrochemical signature. Its shape and age-related shift provide information on aging processes and material composition on both electrodes. However, most OCV analyses have to be conducted in laboratories or specified field tests to ensure suitable data quality. Here, we present a method that reconstructs the OCV curve continuously over the lifetime of a battery using the operational data of home storage field measurements over eight years. We show that low-dynamic operational phases, such as the overnight household supply with electricity, are suitable for recreating quasi OCV curves. We apply incremental capacity analysis and differential voltage analysis and show that known features of interest from laboratory measurements can be tracked to determine degradation modes in field operation. The dominant degradation mode observed for the home storage systems under evaluation is the loss of lithium inventory, while the loss of active material might be present in some cases. We apply the method to lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), a blend of lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and NMC, and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Field capacity tests validate the method.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MMOFs), where magnetic metal nodes are connected into a crystal structure by organic linkers, have a potential to host exotic magnetic states. We present a study of bulk magnetic properties of four metal-organic frameworks with the same boron imidazolate linkers, Cu-BIF, Co-BIF, Ni-BIF, and newly synthesized Zn-BIF, displaying a variety of lattice structures and nontrivial magnetic behaviors. While non-magnetic Zn-BIF provides an offset of magnetic response, magnetic susceptibility measurements of the other three magnetic materials demonstrate the presence of weak magnetic interactions in these MOFs, which differ between materials by sign and size. Cu-BIF, where magnetic nodes are connected into octahedral cages, shows simple paramagnetic behavior. Triangular lattice Co-MOF shows antiferromagnetic interactions on the order of 1 K, and a spin-crossover-like effect in magnetic susceptibility due to thermal depopulation of excited crystal electric field levels. Magnetic properties of Ni-BIF suggest sizable ferromagnetic interactions. Using DC/AC susceptibility and variable-field DC magnetization, we detect cluster spin-glass behavior in Ni-BIF and discuss possible microscopic origins of this behavior. This work demonstrates the variety of magnetic properties that are possible with a single organic ligand, and establishes the low energy scale of magnetic interactions through superexchange in boron imidazolate frameworks.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-induced pseudo-gap formation in antiferromagnetic Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural defects are important for both solid-state chemistry and physics, as they can have a significant impact on chemical stability and physical properties. Here, we identify a vacancyinduced pseudo-gap formation in antiferromagnetic Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb. Cr$_{1-x}$ZnSb alloys were studied combining efforts of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental methods to elucidate the effect of vacancies. Detailed analyses (X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction, transmission and secondary scanning electron microscopy) of Cr$_{1-x}$ZnSb, $0&lt;x&lt;0.20$, prompts Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb as the only stable compound, crystallizing with the MnAlGe-type structure. From DFT calculations, an antiferromagnetic spin configuration of Cr local magnetic moments was found to be favorable for both, the perfectly stoichiometric compound CrZnSb, as well as for Cr$_{0.875}$ZnSb. Magnetic order is observed experimentally for Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb by temperature- and field-dependent magnetization measurements, revealing a magnetic phase transition near 220 K, which is corroborated by zero-field muon spin relaxation studies. Thermoelectric transport properties exhibit distinct maxima in the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity at around 190 K. Analyzing the measured data on the basis of a triple parabolic band model and DFT simulations, their characteristic features are traced back to a pseudo-gap in the electronic structure arising from a particular vacancy arrangement. These findings offer valuable insights into the role of vacancies in defected materials, contributing to the broader understanding of structural defects and their impact on the electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Ferroelectric-Like Behavior in Leaky Dielectrics: A Microscopic Model for Polarization Dynamics and Hysteresis Inversion</title>

Abstract: Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can arise solely from energy and voltage polarity-dependent transport and asymmetries in the transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our findings offer valuable perspectives for applications in capacitors, transistors, and memory devices.</description>

      <title>The Crystallographic Spin Point Groups and their Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12784v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's in the context of condensed matter physics and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory ofcrystallographic spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering $598$ groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)-irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19421</link>

Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications, which are receiving increasing attention. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators, from the perspective of material design and in establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of the 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. As the total atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The trend persists until the bandgap, when combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, becomes small enough to lead to band inversion with a re-opened gap, exhibiting nontrivial topology. Especially in specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Most importantly, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures can be significantly tuned synchronously through small biaxial strain. Our work not only expands the diverse Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators.</description>
