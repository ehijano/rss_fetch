      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Seismic Inversion Through Integrated Importance Sampling and Ensemble Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic inversion is essential for geophysical exploration and geological assessment, but it is inherently subject to significant uncertainty. This uncertainty stems primarily from the limited information provided by observed seismic data, which is largely a result of constraints in data collection geometry. As a result, multiple plausible velocity models can often explain the same set of seismic observations. In deep learning-based seismic inversion, uncertainty arises from various sources, including data noise, neural network design and training, and inherent data limitations. This study introduces a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in seismic inversion by integrating ensemble methods with importance sampling. By leveraging ensemble approach in combination with importance sampling, we enhance the accuracy of uncertainty analysis while maintaining computational efficiency. The method involves initializing each model in the ensemble with different weights, introducing diversity in predictions and thereby improving the robustness and reliability of the inversion outcomes. Additionally, the use of importance sampling weights the contribution of each ensemble sample, allowing us to use a limited number of ensemble samples to obtain more accurate estimates of the posterior distribution. Our approach enables more precise quantification of uncertainty in velocity models derived from seismic data. By utilizing a limited number of ensemble samples, this method achieves an accurate and reliable assessment of uncertainty, ultimately providing greater confidence in seismic inversion results.</description>

      <title>The early Solar System and its meteoritical witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteorites, and in particular primitive meteorites (chondrites), are irreplaceable probes of the solar protoplanetary disk. We review their essential properties and endeavour to place them in astrophysical context. The earliest solar system solids, refractory inclusions, may have formed over the innermost au of the disk and have been transported outward by its expansion or turbulent diffusion. The age spread of chondrite components may be reconciled with the tendency of drag-induced radial drift if they were captured in pressure maxima, which may account for the non-carbonaceous/carbonaceous meteorite isotopic dichotomy. The solid/gas ratio around unity witnessed by chondrules, if interpreted as nebular (non-impact) products, suggests efficient radial concentration and settling at such locations, conducive to planetesimal formation by the streaming instability. The cause of the pressure bumps, e.g. Jupiter or condensation lines, remains to be ascertained.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Taylor-Proudman constraint explains the flow into Tangent Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tangent Cylinders (TCs) have shaped our understanding of planetary dynamos and liquid cores. The Taylor-Proudman Constraint (TPC) due to planetary rotation creates these imaginary surfaces separating polar and equatorial regions but cannot explain the flows meandering through them. Here we establish and verify experimentally that magnetic fields aligned with rotation drive flows \emph{into} TCs, linked to the flows \emph{along} TCs by a \emph{magnetic} Taylor-Proudman constraint. This constraint explains and quantifies how magnetic fields reshape rotating flows in planetary interiors and magnetorotating flows in general.</description>
