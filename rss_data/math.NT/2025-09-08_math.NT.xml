      <title>Wilson's theorem modulo higher prime powers II: Bernoulli numbers and polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By recent work of the author, Wilson's theorem as well as the Wilson quotient can be described by supercongruences of power sums of Fermat quotients modulo every higher prime power. We translate these congruences into congruences of power sums and Bernoulli numbers. This together provides relatively short proofs of the congruences compared to former approaches. As an application, we compute, e.g., the Wilson quotient up to $\pmod{p^4}$ and equivalently the factorial $(p-1)!$ up to $\pmod{p^5}$, which can be extended to any higher prime power with some effort. As a by-product, we determine some power sums of the Fermat quotients up to $\pmod{p^4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a lower bound for the maximum value of class group $L$-functions attached to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ at the central point and show that this value is on average at least $$\exp\Bigg(\delta\sqrt{\frac{\log D \log \log \log D}{\log \log D}} \Bigg)$$ for any $\delta &lt; \frac{1}{4}$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we relate the fake special cycle classes $z_{\mathbb{L}_{\sigma},r}$ attached to a Hecke eigensheaf $\mathbb{L}_{\sigma}\in\mathrm{Shv}_{\mathrm{Nilp}}(\mathrm{Bun}_G)$ introduced in the author's previous work to the isotypic part of special cycles on Shtukas. As an application, we relate the self-intersection number of the isotypic part of special cycles arising from Rankin--Selberg period to higher derivatives of Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>The dimension of well approximable numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey article, we explore a central theme in Diophantine approximation inspired by a celebrated result of Besicovitch on the Hausdorff dimension of well approximable real numbers. We outline some of the key developments stemming from Besicovitch's result, with a focus on the Mass Transference Principle, Ubiquity and Diophantine approximation on manifolds and fractals. We highlight the subtle yet profound connections between number theory and fractal geometry, and discuss several open problems at their intersection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spivey's combinatorial method revealed an important identity for Bell numbers, involving Stirling numbers of the second kind. This paper extends his work by deriving Spivey-type recurrence relations for fully degenerate Bell polynomials and degenerate Fubini polynomials. Our derivation uses degenerate Stirling numbers of the second kind and two-variable degenerate Fubini polynomials of order a.</description>

      <title>Centered Moments of Weighted One-Level Densities of $GL(2)$ $L$-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Katz and Sarnak conjectured that the behavior of zeros near the central point of any family of $L$-functions is well-modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near $1$ of some classical compact group (either the symplectic, unitary, or even, odd, or full orthogonal group). In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that the symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family are weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the one-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different choices of weights. We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n}\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level calculations when $n&gt;1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold products of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and Reno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We then perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their contributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we use to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis, facilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Uniform subconvexity bounds for $GL(2)\times GL(2)$ $L$-functions in the spectral aspect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the second moment for $GL(2)\times GL(2)$ $L$-functions $L(\frac{1}{2},f\times g)$, which leads to a uniform subconvexity bound in the spectral aspect. In particular, if either $f$ or $g$ is a dihedral Maass newform, or if one of them has level $1$, we obtain a Burgess-type bound that is uniform in both $t_f$ and $t_g$, where $t_f$, $t_g$ denote the spectral parameters of $f$, $g$. As an application, we also establish a shrinking result for QUE in the case of dihedral Maass newforms.</description>

      <title>Tribonacci-Lucas numbers that are palindromic concatenations of two distinct repdigits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tribonacci-Lucas sequence $\{S_n\}_{n\ge 0}$ is defined by the linear recurrence relation $S_{n+3} = S_{n+2} + S_{n+1} + S_n$, for $ n\ge 0 $, with the initial conditions $S_0 =S_2= 3$ and $S_1 = 1$. A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. This paper uses Baker's theory for nozero lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers, and reduction methods involving the theory of continued fraction to determine all Tribonacci-Lucas numbers that are palindromic concatenations of two distinct repdigits.</description>

      <title>Restricted divisor functions and half Appell sums in higher-level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the value distributions of coefficients in certain $q$-series related to half Appell sums in higher-level and the first moment of the Garvan's $k$-rank of partitions. We prove that these coefficients equal certain restricted divisor functions and can take any nonnegative integer value infinitely many times. As applications, we confirm a conjecture of Xiong on the coefficients of a half Lerch sum and a conjecture of Garvan and Jennings-Shaffer on the nonnegativity of spt-crank-type partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zeros of the theta functions of the lattices $\Gamma_{8k}$, a family of even unimodular lattices generalizing the $\mathsf{E}_{8}$ lattice. We show that the zeros of $\Theta_{\Gamma_{8k}}$ all lie on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$ in the fundamental domain and compute their height and limit distribution.</description>

      <title>Hecke $L$-functions Away From The Central Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the first moment of cubic Hecke $L$-functions over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ evaluated at any $s$ inside the critical strip. The first moment for $s&lt;\frac{1}{2}$ is particularly interesting, and we show there is a phase transition at $s=\frac{1}{3}$. This extends the analogue result of David-Meisner for the first moment over function fields. As in their work, the computation of the moment at $s=\frac{1}{3}$ relies on a cancellation between two terms which are a priori not related: a main term of the principal sum which comes from cubes, and the contribution from infinitely many residues of Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to the dual sum. The cancellation also improves the error term and exhibits a secondary term for all $s$. In particular, at $s=\frac{1}{2}$, we prove the existence of a secondary term of size $Q^{5/6}$, where the size of the family is $Q$.
  We conjecture that a similar behaviour would hold for higher order Hecke $L$-functions attached to $\ell^{th}$ order residue symbols, refining a function field conjecture of David and Meisner.
  The proof follows the steps of writing $L(s,\chi)$ as two finite sums with the approximate functional equation. Two main ingredients are then exploited: the bound on the second moment of $L(1/2+it,\chi)$ that follows from Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve, and the deep work of Kubota and Patterson which connects the Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to metaplectic forms, and gives a formula for its residues in terms of the Fourier coefficients of metaplectic theta functions. This is only known for cubic Gauss sums, and not for general Gauss sums of order $\ell\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>On Hardy's $Z$-function and its derivatives associated with Selberg class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardy's $Z$-function $Z(t)$ is a real-valued function of the real valuable $t$, and its zeros exactly correspond to those of the Riemann zeta-function on the critical line. In 2012, K.~Matsuoka showed that for any non-negative integer $k$, there exists a $T=T(k)&gt;0$ such that $Z^{(k+1)}(t)$ has exactly one zero between consecutive zeros of $Z^{(k)}(t)$ for $t\ge T$ under the Riemann Hypothesis. In this article, we extend Matsuoka's theorem to some $L$-functions in Selberg class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\chi$ be a non-principal Dirichlet character and $L(s, \chi)$ be the associated Dirichlet $L$-function. Let us use $\mathcal{L}(s,\chi)$ to denote its logarithmic derivative $L'(s, \chi)/L(s, \chi)$. We first prove some arithmetic formulas for higher derivatives $\mathcal{L}^{(r)}(1,\chi)$. We then investigate their moments. We study the average of $P^{(a,b)}(\mathcal{L}^{(r)}(1,\chi))$ as $\chi$ runs over all non-principal Dirichlet characters with a given large prime conductor $m$, where $P^{(a,b)}(z) = z^a \overline{z}^b$.</description>

Abstract: Let $N&gt;1$ and let $\Phi_N(X,Y)\in\mathbb{Z}[X,Y]$ be the modular polynomial which vanishes precisely at pairs of $j$-invariants of elliptic curves linked by a cyclic isogeny of degree $N$. In this note we study the divisibility of the coefficients $\Phi_N(X+J, Y+J)$ for certain algebraic numbers $J$, in particular $J=0$ and $J=1728$. It turns out that these coefficients are highly divisible by small primes at which $J$ is supersingular.</description>

      <title>Diophantine tuples and Integral Ideals of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $n$ is the fundamental discriminant associated with a quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We show that for every Diophantine $m$-tuple $ \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m\} $ with the property $ D(n) $, there exists integral ideals $ \mathfrak{t}_1, \mathfrak{t}_2, \ldots, \mathfrak{t}_m $ of $ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n}) $ and $c\in \{1,2\}$ such that $ t_i= c\mathcal{N}(\mathfrak{t}_i) $ for $ i=1,2, \ldots, m $. Here, $ \mathcal{N}(\cdot) $ denotes the norm map from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ to $\mathbb{Q}$. Moreover, we explicitly construct the above ideals for Diophantine pairs $\{a_1, a_2\}$ whenever $\gcd(a_1, a_2) = 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taelman class groups associated to Drinfeld modules over function fields serve as an analogue of ideal class groups of number fields. In this paper, we establish an analogue of Iwasawa's asymptotic formula for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions in the context of the Taelman class groups. For this purpose, we naturally introduce and investigate Taelman class groups with moduli.</description>

      <title>Contour Integrations and Parity Results of Cyclotomic Euler $T$-Sums and Multiple $t$-Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will employ the method of contour integration to investigate the parity results of non-embedded cyclotomic multiple $t$-values, which we refer to as cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums. We can provide explicit parity formulas for the linear and quadratic cases of cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums, as well as state a parity theorem for the general case. We also present illustrative examples and corollaries. From this, some parity results for classical cyclotomic multiple $t$-values can be derived. Furthermore, we present several general formulas for cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums with denominators involving arbitrary rational polynomials through residue computations. By evaluating these polynomials and computing residues, many other formulas analogous to cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums can be derived. In particular, we also obtain certain parity results for the cyclotomic versions of multiple $T$-values as defined by Kaneko and Tsumura. Finally, we propose some conjectures and questions regarding the parity of cyclotomic multiple $t$-values and cyclotomic multiple $T$-values.</description>

      <title>The coarse trace formula of GL(4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trace formula is an important method to study the Langlands program. Arthur obtains the existence of stable trace formula for connected reductive group. In this paper, we will give the explicit coarse trace formula of GL(4). In general case, Arthur applies the truncation operator on the two sides of trace formula, which is convergent. In our case, we will prove that the divergent terms of the two sides of the trace formula of GL(4)$ are equal. We also obtain the explicit formula for ramified orbits of the geometric side of trace formula of GL(4).</description>

      <title>Construction of Higher Chow cycles on cyclic coverings of $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct higher Chow cycles of type $(2, 1)$ on a certain family of surfaces, which are constructed by a product of certain hypergeometric curves of degree $N$. We prove that for a very general member, these cycles are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Z}$ and generate a subgroup of $\operatorname{rank} \ge 36 \cdot \varphi(N)$, where $\varphi(N)$ is Euler's totient function, by computing the image of the transcendental regulator map.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*}
  \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*}
  \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*}
  In this work, we show that \begin{equation*}
  F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$.
  Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</description>

Abstract: We show that quasi-$F$-pure but not $F$-pure isolated quasi-homogeneous hypersurface singularities necessarily have $F$-pure threshold $1 - \frac{1}{p}$. This extends work of Bhatt and Singh beyond the Calabi-Yau case. We also classify the (quasi)-$F$-purity of Fermat hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>$q$-Binomial expansions of the truncated MacMahon's $q$-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1920, MacMahon introduced two families of $q$-series to study divisor sums. Recent work has shown that MacMahon's $q$-series are closely connected to overpartitions and $3$-colored partitions. Merca introduced truncated forms of MacMahon's $q$-series to generalize earlier results by Andrews-Rose and Ono-Singh, and posed two conjectures regarding the $q$-binomial expansions of these truncated series. In this paper, we provide combinatorial proofs of Merca's conjectures through the combinatorial interpretation of $q$-binomial coefficients.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to study basic structures and interrelations of $\delta$-rings, perfectoid towers, and lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences over Noetherian rings in positive or mixed characteristic. Then we discuss some methods for constructing perfectoid towers, dealing with $p$-torsion free and $p$-torsion cases, respectively. Some interesting examples arise as quotients by monomial or binomial ideals or determinantal rings. We also explain a geometric method with a view toward constructing rings with certain singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1304.3043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a rational prime $p \geq 3$ and an integer $n \geq 2$, we study the modularity of continuous 2-dimensional mod $p^n$ Galois representations of $\Gal(\bar{\Q}/\Q)$ whose residual representations are odd and absolutely irreducible. Under suitable hypotheses on the local structure of these representations and the size of their images we use deformation theory to construct characteristic 0 lifts. We then invoke modularity lifting results to prove that these lifts are modular. As an application, we show that certain unramified mod $p^n$ Galois representations arise from modular forms of weight $p^{n-1}(p-1)+1$.</description>

Abstract: We improve 1987 estimates of Patterson for sums of quartic Gauss sums over primes. Our Type-I and Type-II estimates feature new ideas, including use of the quadratic large sieve over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and Suzuki's evaluation of the Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of quartic theta functions at squares. We also conjecture asymptotics for certain moments of quartic Gauss sums over primes.</description>

Abstract: For a number field $k$ and an odd prime number $p$, we consider the maximal multiple $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $\tilde{k}$ of $k$ and the unramified Iwasawa module $X(\tilde{k})$, which is the Galois group of the maximal unramified abelian $p$-extension of $\tilde{k}$. In this article, we classify the CM-fields $k$ in which $p$ splits completely and for which $X(\tilde{k}) = 0$. In addition, we provide an alternative proof of the sufficient condition for $X(\tilde{k})=0$, based on the ideas of Minardi, Itoh, and Fujii in the study of the generalized Greenberg conjecture.</description>

      <title>Initial layer of the anti-cyclotomic Z\_3-extension of Q( $\sqrt$ -m) and capitulation phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08214v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let k=Q($\sqrt$-m) be an imaginary quadratic field. We consider the properties of capitulation of the p-class group of k in the anti-cyclotomic Zp-extension k^acyc of k; for this, using a new method based on the Log\_p-function (Theorems 1.3 and 2.3), we determine, for p = 3, the first layer k\_1^acyc of k^acyc over k, and we examine if, at least, some partial capitulation may exist in k\_1^acyc. The answer is obviously yes, even when k^acyc/k is totally ramified. We have conjectured that this phenomenon of capitulation is specific of all the Zp-extensions of k, distinct from the cyclotomic one. We characterize a sub-family of fields k (Normal Split cases) for which k^acyc is not linearly disjoint from the Hilbert class field (Theorem 3.1). No assumptions are made on the structure of the 3-class group of k, nor on the splitting of 3 in k and in its mirror field k*=Q($\sqrt$3m). Four pari/gp programs are given with numerical illustrations to cover all cases without any limitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a mod $\ell$ congruence between a Klingen Eisenstein series (associated to a classical newform $\phi$ of weight $k$) and a Siegel cusp form $f$ with irreducible Galois representation. We use this congruence to show non-vanishing of the Bloch-Kato Selmer group $H^1_f(\mathbf{Q}, \textrm{ad}^0\rho_{\phi}(2-k)\otimes \mathbf{Q}_{\ell}/\mathbf{Z}_{\ell})$ under certain assumptions and provide an example. We then prove an $R=dvr$ theorem for the Fontaine-Laffaille universal deformation ring of $\overline{\rho}_f$ under some assumptions, in particular, that the residual Selmer group $H^1_f(\mathbf{Q}, \textrm{ad}^0\overline{\rho}_{\phi}(k-2))$ is cyclic. For this we prove a result about extensions of Fontaine-Laffaille modules. We end by formulating conditions for when $H^1_f(\mathbf{Q}, \textrm{ad}^0\overline{\rho}_{\phi}(k-2))$ is non-cyclic and the Eisenstein ideal is non-principal.</description>

      <title>Solving Modular Linear Systems with a Constraint by parallel decomposition of the Smith form and extended Euclidean division modulo powers of primes divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the theta series associated to the quadratic form $Q(\Vec{x}) \coloneqq x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2$ with congruence conditions on $x_i$ modulo $2,3,4$ and $6$.
  By employing special operators on modular, non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight 2, we construct a basis for Eisenstein space for levels $2^k, k\leq 7$, $3^{\ell}, \ell\leq 3$ and $p$, for odd prime $p$.
  Using the relation between the trace of Frobenius on an elliptic curve and the Fourier coefficients of the cusp form part of theta series corresponding to $Q$, we establish relation between the number of integer solutions to the equation $Q(\Vec{x}) = p$ and the number of $\F_p$-rational points on the associated elliptic curve under certain congruence conditions on $p$.</description>

      <title>Arthur's groups $\mathcal S$ in local Langlands correspondence for certain covering groups of algebraic tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the finite group $\mathcal S$ parametrizing a packet in the local Langlands correspondence for a Brylinski-Deligne covering group of an algebraic torus, under some assumption on ramification. Especially, this work generalizes Weissman's result on covering groups of tori that split over an unramified extension of the base field.</description>

      <title>The first moment of central value of primitive quartic $L$-functions with fixed genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mean value of the first moment of primitive quartic $L$-functions over $\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ in the non-Kummer setting. Specifically, we study the sum
  \begin{equation*}
  \sum_{\substack{\chi\ primitive\ quartic\\ \chi^2 primitive\\ genus(\chi)=g}}L_q(\frac{1}{2}, \chi),
  \end{equation*} where $L_q(s,\chi)$ denotes the $L$-function associated with primitive quartic character $\chi$. Using double Dirichlet series, we derive an error term of size $q^{(\frac{3}{5}+\varepsilon)g}$.</description>

      <title>On the greatest prime factor of polynomial values and subexponential Szpiro in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining a modular approach to the $abc$ conjecture developed by the second author with the classical method of linear forms in logarithms, we obtain improved unconditional bounds for two classical problems. First, for Szpiro's conjecture when the relevant elliptic curves are members of a one-parameter family (an elliptic surface). And secondly, for the problem of giving lower bounds for the greatest prime factor of polynomial values, in the case of quadratic and cubic polynomials. The latter extends earlier work by the second author for the polynomial $n^2+1$.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Walsh Spectrum of Power Residue S-Boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a prime field with $q \geq 3$, and let $d, m \geq 1$ be integers such that $\gcd \left( d, q \right) = 1$ and $m \mid (q - 1)$. In this paper we bound the absolute values of the Walsh spectrum of S-Boxes $S (x) = x^d \cdot T \left( x^\frac{q - 1}{m} \right)$, where $T$ is a function with $T (x) \neq 0$ if $x \neq 0$. Such S-Boxes have been proposed for the Zero-Knowledge-friendly hash functions Grendel and Polocolo. In particular, we prove the conjectured correlation of the Polocolo S-Box.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present computational algorithms to work with points on the modular curve associated to the normaliser of a non-split Cartan group of prime level $p$. Rather than working with explicit equations, we represent these points using the moduli interpretation of necklaces in the $p$-torsion of elliptic curves. We use our methods to investigate for which primes $\ell\neq p$ two rational points with complex multiplication can have equal reduction modulo $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Wavefront Sets and Generic $L$-packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a classical group defined over a local field $F$ of characteristic zero. Let $\pi$ be an irreducible admissible representation $\pi$ of $G(F)$, which is of Casselman-Wallach type if $F$ is archimedean. If $\pi$ has a generic local $L$-parameter, we define the arithmetic wavefront set ${\rm WF_{ari}}(\pi)$ of $\pi$, which is a subset of $F$-rational nilpotent orbits of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}(F)$ of $G(F)$, by means of the arithmetic structures of the enhanced $L$-parameter $(\varphi,\chi)$ of $\pi$. Those arithmetic structures are discovered by using our method of consecutive descents of enhanced $L$-parameters, based on the rationality of the local Langlands correspondence and the local Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture. We study the basic structure of ${\rm WF_{ari}(\pi)}$ and prove that it is an invariant of $\pi$ (Theorem 5.10). Furthermore, those basic structures ${\rm WF_{ari}(\pi)^{max}}$ are expected to yield the precise $F$-rational structure of ${\rm WF_{ari}(\pi)^{max}}$, which has been realized, when $F$ is archimedean, in Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 (Theorems 7.10, 7.14, and 9.2). Based on the local Langlands reciprocity, the Wavefront Set Conjecture (Conjecture 1.2 and Conjecture 5.14) asserts that the wavefront sets on the L-parameter side should be closed related to those on the representation side, namely, \[ {\rm WF_{wm}(\pi)^{max}}={\rm WF_{ari}(\pi)^{max}}={\rm WF_{tr}(\pi)^{max}} \] when $\pi$ has a generic local $L$-parameter, where the algebraic wavefront set ${\rm WF_{wm}}(\pi)$ is defined by Moeglin and Waldspurger in [MW87], using generalized Whittaker models and the analytic wavefront set ${\rm WF_{tr}}(\pi)$ is defined by Howe [H81, Hd85] using distribution characters, and also by [H74, HC78, BV80]. Conjecture 1.2 is verified for families of interesting cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08004v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. One of the most important contributions of this paper is to show that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that \[|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.\] This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0&lt;x\le y&lt;2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)&gt;0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</description>

      <title>A remark on the Langlands correspondence for tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an algebraic torus defined over a local (or global) field $F$, a celebrated result of R.P. Langlands establishes a natural homomorphism from the group of continuous cohomology classes of the Weil group, valued in the dual torus, onto the space of complex characters of the rational points of the torus (or automorphic characters in the global case). We expand on this result by detailing its topological aspects. We show that if we topologize the relevant spaces of continuous homomorphisms and continuous cochains using the compact-open topology, Langlands's map becomes a (surjective, finite-to-one) homomorphism of abelian complex Lie groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that, in both the local and global settings, the subset of unramified characters is the identity component of the relevant space of characters. Finally, we compare the group of unramified characters with the Galois (co)invariants of the dual torus.</description>

      <title>Tschirnhausen bundles of covers of the projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. Which bundles are possible? Equivalently, which $\mathbb{P}^{d-2}$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain such covers? (In the language of many previous papers: what are the scrollar invariants of the cover?)
  We give a complete answer in degree $4$, which exhibits the expected pathologies. We describe a polytope (one per degree) which we propose gives the complete answer for primitive covers, i.e. covers that don't factor through a subcover. We show that all such bundles (for primitive covers) lie in this polytope, and that a ``positive proportion'' of the polytope arises from smooth covers. Moreover, we show the necessity of the primitivity assumption. Finally, we show that the image of the map from the Hurwitz space of smooth covers to the space of bundles is not preserved by generization (for $d&gt;5$ and $g \gg_d 1$).</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>
