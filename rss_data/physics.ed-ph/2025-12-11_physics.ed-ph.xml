      <title>Lessons from pendulums: A design comparison of three lab activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three versions of a pendulum lab activity and explore how shared theoretical commitments, motivations, and aspirations can lead to divergences in curriculum design. Building on Boudreaux &amp; Elby (2020) we provide another demonstration of how theoretical commitments and perspectives influence curriculum development. In this paper, the variations across these lab activities despite our shared theoretical bases constitutes the phenomena of interest. We argue that three main factors lead to the variations in our design decisions: different expectations and understandings of our student populations, variations in our ancillary pedagogical goals, and fine grained differences in our theoretical perspectives. By focusing on the differences between our labs, we highlight the limitations of theory alone to determine curriculum development and demonstrate the process of theory, in conversation with local particularities, guiding design.</description>

      <title>Perspectives of Women and Men Students and Faculty on Conceptual and Quantitative Problem-Solving in Physics from Introductory to Graduate Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing expertise in physics requires appropriate integration and assimilation of physics and mathematics. Instructors and students often describe physics courses in terms of their emphasis on conceptual and quantitative problem-solving. For example, they may argue that a course emphasizes primarily conceptual over quantitative problem-solving or may emphasize equally on both depending on instructional context and assessment design. In this study, we investigated how students and instructors across different levels of physics instruction perceive the roles and development of conceptual and quantitative problem-solving in student learning and expertise development. Using departmental surveys administered at the beginning and end of each semester, we collected both Likert-scale and open-ended responses from students enrolled in introductory, upper-level undergraduate and graduate physics courses. These surveys assessed students' self-perceived skills, preferences and perceptions of instrucots and course emphasis. To complement student perspectives, we conducted interviews with instructors using parallel questions adapted to reflect instructional goals and expectations. Our findings highlight patterns in how students and instructos prioritize conceptual and quantitative problem-solving across course levels, as well as alignment and misalignment between student and instructor perspectives.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Surrogates for Gas Dynamics: A Physics-Informed Pedagogical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressible flow problems are characterized by highly nonlinear, implicit, and often transcendental governing equations. In undergraduate gas dynamics educa- tion, solving these equations traditionally relies on iterative numerical methods or extensive look-up tables, which can obscure the physical intuition of the solution space. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework using Deep Learning to generate high-fidelity surrogate models for five canonical problems: Rayleigh flow, Fanno flow, oblique shocks, convergent-divergent nozzles, and unsteady shock tubes. We detail the specific neural network architectures and physics-informed feature en- gineering strategies required for each problem, such as using logarithmic inputs for Fanno friction parameters or geometric anchors for oblique shocks. The resulting models achieve high accuracy and enable instantaneous visualization of complex design spaces, such as thermodynamic T s diagrams and unsteady x t wave interactions. This approach demonstrates how modern data-driven techniques can be integrated into the physics curriculum to enhance conceptual understanding.</description>
