      <title>The phase diagram of compressed sensing with $\ell_0$-norm regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noiseless compressive sensing is a two-steps setting that allows for undersampling a sparse signal and then reconstructing it without loss of information. The LASSO algorithm, based on $\lone$ regularization, provides an efficient and robust to address this problem, but it fails in the regime of very high compression rate. Here we present two algorithms based on $\lzero$-norm regularization instead that outperform the LASSO in terms of compression rate in the Gaussian design setting for measurement matrix. These algorithms are based on the Approximate Survey Propagation, an algorithmic family within the Approximate Message Passing class. In the large system limit, they can be rigorously tracked through State Evolution equations and it is possible to exactly predict the range compression rates for which perfect signal reconstruction is possible. We also provide a statistical physics analysis of the $\lzero$-norm noiseless compressive sensing model. We show the existence of both a replica symmetric state and a 1-step replica symmmetry broken (1RSB) state for sufficiently low $\lzero$-norm regularization. The recovery limits of our algorithms are linked to the behavior of the 1RSB solution.</description>

      <title>Local and energy-resolved topological invariants for Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems offer a perfect breeding ground for out-of-equilibrium engineering of topological boundary states at zero energy ($0$-mode), as well as finite energy ($\pi$-mode), with the latter having no static analog. The Floquet operator and the effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which encapsulate the stroboscopic features of the driven system, capture both spectral and localization properties of the $0$- and $\pi$-modes but sometimes fail to provide complete topological characterization, especially when $0$- and $\pi$-modes coexist. In this work, we utilize the spectral localizer, a powerful local probe that can provide numerically efficient, spatially local, and energy-resolved topological characterization. In particular, we apply the spectral localizer to the effective Floquet Hamiltonian for driven one- and two-dimensional topological systems with no or limited symmetries and are able to assign topological invariants, or local markers, that characterize the $0$- and the $\pi$-boundary modes individually and unambiguously. Due to the spatial resolution, we also demonstrate that the extracted topological invariants are suitable for studying driven disordered systems and can even capture disorder-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>NEAR: A Training-Free Pre-Estimator of Machine Learning Model Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been shown to be state-of-the-art machine learning models in a wide variety of applications, including natural language processing and image recognition. However, building a performant neural network is a laborious task and requires substantial computing power. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) addresses this issue by an automatic selection of the optimal network from a set of potential candidates. While many NAS methods still require training of (some) neural networks, zero-cost proxies promise to identify the optimal network without training. In this work, we propose the zero-cost proxy Network Expressivity by Activation Rank (NEAR). It is based on the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix, i.e., the values of a neural network layer before and after applying its activation function. We demonstrate the cutting-edge correlation between this network score and the model accuracy on NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench-SSS/TSS. In addition, we present a simple approach to estimate the optimal layer sizes in multi-layer perceptrons. Furthermore, we show that this score can be utilized to select hyperparameters such as the activation function and the neural network weight initialization scheme.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum calculations have borrowed many tools and algorithms from the machine learning community in the recent years. Leveraging great expressive power and efficient gradient-based optimization, researchers have shown that trial states inspired by deep learning problems can accurately model many-body correlated phenomena in spin, fermionic and qubit systems. In this review, we derive the central equations of different flavors variational Monte Carlo (VMC) approaches, including ground state search, time evolution and overlap optimization, and discuss data-driven tasks like quantum state tomography. An emphasis is put on the geometry of the variational manifold as well as bottlenecks in practical implementations. An overview of recent results of first-principles ground-state and real-time calculations is provided.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for Anderson localization on high-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin helices in the diluted one-dimensional $XX$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.</description>

      <title>Dataset-learning duality and emergent criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.</description>

      <title>Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Kernel density estimation for a high-dimensional distribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of large number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the regime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality $d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three distinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical regime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which is akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of the bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The statistics of $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from $\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable distribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in this paper. Our findings reveal limitations of classical approaches, show the relevance of these new statistical regimes, and offer new insights for Kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings.</description>
