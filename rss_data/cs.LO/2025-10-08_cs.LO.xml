      <title>Reversible computations are computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality serves as an abstract notion of time for concurrent systems. A computation is causal, or simply valid, if each observation of a computation event is preceded by the observation of its causes. The present work establishes that this simple requirement is equally relevant when the occurrence of an event is invertible. We propose a conservative extension of causal models for concurrency that accommodates reversible computations. We first model reversible computations using a symmetric residuation operation in the general model of configuration structures. We show that stable configuration structures, which correspond to prime algebraic domains, remain stable under the action of this residuation. We then derive a semantics of reversible computations for prime event structures, which is shown to coincide with a switch operation that dualizes conflict and causality.</description>

      <title>Strong Dinatural Transformations and Generalised Codensity Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce dicodensity monads: a generalisation of pointwise codensity monads generated by functors to monads generated by mixed-variant bifunctors. Our construction is based on the notion of strong dinaturality (also known as Barr dinaturality), and is inspired by denotational models of certain types in polymorphic lambda calculi - in particular, a form of continuation monads with universally quantified variables, such as the Church encoding of the list monad in System F. Extending some previous results on Cayley-style representations, we provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish an isomorphism between a monad and the dicodensity monad for a given bifunctor. Then, we focus on the class of monads obtained by instantiating our construction with hom-functors and, more generally, bifunctors given by objects of homomorphisms (that is, internalised hom-sets between Eilenberg--Moore algebras). This gives us, for example, novel presentations of monads generated by different kinds of semirings and other theories used to model ordered nondeterministic computations.</description>

      <title>The Algebra of Meaning: Why Machines Need Montague More Than Moore's Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary language models are fluent yet routinely mis-handle the types of meaning their outputs entail. We argue that hallucination, brittle moderation, and opaque compliance outcomes are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics rather than data or scale limitations. Building on Montague's view of language as typed, compositional algebra, we recast alignment as a parsing problem: natural-language inputs must be compiled into structures that make explicit their descriptive, normative, and legal dimensions under context.
  We present Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that compiles utterances into Montague-style logical forms and maps them to typed ontologies extended with deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. Neural components extract candidate structures from unstructured inputs; symbolic components perform type checking, constraint reasoning, and cross-jurisdiction mapping to produce compliance-aware guidance rather than binary censorship. In cross-border scenarios, the system "parses once" (e.g., defect claim(product x, company y)) and projects the result into multiple legal ontologies (e.g., defamation risk in KR/JP, protected opinion in US, GDPR checks in EU), composing outcomes into a single, explainable decision.
  This paper contributes: (i) a diagnosis of hallucination as a type error; (ii) a formal Montague-ontology bridge for business/legal reasoning; and (iii) a production-oriented design that embeds typed interfaces across the pipeline. We outline an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic multi-jurisdiction suites. Our position is that trustworthy autonomy requires compositional typing of meaning, enabling systems to reason about what is described, what is prescribed, and what incurs liability within a unified algebra of meaning.</description>

      <title>A Duality Theorem for Classical-Quantum States with Applications to Complete Relational Program Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Duality theorems play a fundamental role in convex optimization. Recently, it was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs, respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al., POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).</description>

      <title>A Calibration-Free Fixed Point of Curved Boolean Logic Matching the Fine-Structure Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) admits a calibration-free fixed point at which the per-face holonomy $\theta_0$ is the same across independent minimal faces (CHSH, KCBS, SAT_6). Equality is enforced by solving the two-component system $F(\delta, \gamma_4, \gamma_5, \gamma_6) = (\theta_0^{(4)} - \theta_0^{(5)}, \theta_0^{(5)} - \theta_0^{(6))} = 0$ with a Gauss-Newton method (no external scale). A finite-difference Jacobian is full rank at the solution, implying local uniqueness. Working at the coupling level $g = |\theta_0|/(2\pi n)$ removes hidden length factors; at the equality point our normalization audit shows $g = \alpha$ (Thomson limit) within numerical tolerance. The SU(1,1) corner words and overlap placements used to compute $\theta_0$ are specified exactly; we also report a variational minimax analysis on g and a pilot non-backtracking spectral density that coincides numerically with the per-edge coupling, suggesting a purely topological formulation. Scope: the match is to the low-energy (Thomson) limit; a full spectral equality on the contextual complex is left as a short conjecture. These results promote the CBL-$\alpha$ connection from a calibrated identification to a calibration-free derivation candidate.</description>

      <title>Strict Rezk completions of models of HoTT and homotopy canonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new constructive proof of homotopy canonicity for homotopy type theory (HoTT). Canonicity proofs typically involve gluing constructions over the syntax of type theory. We instead use a gluing construction over a "strict Rezk completion" of the syntax of HoTT. The strict Rezk completion is specified and constructed in the topos of cartesian cubical sets. It completes a model of HoTT to an equivalent model satisfying a completeness condition, providing an equivalence between terms of identity types and cubical paths between terms. This generalizes the ordinary Rezk completion of a 1-category.</description>
