      <title>Solving General Natural-Language-Description Optimization Problems with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems seek to find the best solution to an objective under a set of constraints, and have been widely investigated in real-world applications. Modeling and solving optimization problems in a specific domain typically require a combination of domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, making it difficult for general users and even domain professionals. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called OptLLM that augments LLMs with external solvers. Specifically, OptLLM accepts user queries in natural language, convert them into mathematical formulations and programming codes, and calls the solvers to calculate the results for decision-making. In addition, OptLLM supports multi-round dialogues to gradually refine the modeling and solving of optimization problems. To illustrate the effectiveness of OptLLM, we provide tutorials on three typical optimization applications and conduct experiments on both prompt-based GPT models and a fine-tuned Qwen model using a large-scale selfdeveloped optimization dataset. Experimental results show that OptLLM works with various LLMs, and the fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy boost compared to the promptbased models. Some features of OptLLM framework have been available for trial since June 2023 (https://opt.alibabacloud.com/chat or https://opt.aliyun.com/chat).</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Objective-Function-Free Adaptive Regularization Method with Optimal Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully stochastic second-order adaptive-regularization method for unconstrained nonconvex optimization is presented which never computes the objective-function value, but yet achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ complexity bound for finding first-order critical points. The method is noise-tolerant and the inexactness conditions required for convergence depend on the history of past steps. Applications to cases where derivative evaluation is inexact and to minimization of finite sums by sampling are discussed. Numerical experiments on large binary classification problems illustrate the potential of the new method.</description>

      <title>The Internal Model Principle of Time-Varying Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying optimization problems are central to many engineering applications, where performance metrics and system constraints evolve dynamically with time. A number of algorithms have been proposed in recent years to solve such problems; a common feature of all these methods is that they implicitly require precise knowledge of the temporal variability of the solutions in order to exactly track the optimizers. In this paper, we seek to lift these stringent assumptions. Our main result is a fundamental characterization, showing that an algorithm can track an optimal trajectory if and only if it contains a model of the temporal variability of the problem. We refer to this concept to as the internal model principle of time-varying optimization. By recasting the optimization objective as a nonlinear regulation problem and using tools from center manifold theory, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions both for an optimization algorithm to achieve exact asymptotic tracking and for such an algorithm to exist. We illustrate the applicability of the approach numerically on both synthetic problems as well as practical problems in transportation.</description>

      <title>Geometric Approach and Closed Exact Formulae for the Lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a geometric approach to the lasso. We study the tangency of the level sets of the least square objective function with the polyhedral boundary sets $B(t)$ of the parameters in $\mathbb R^p$ with the $\ell_1$ norm equal to $t$. Here $t$ decreases from the value $\hat t$, which corresponds to the actual, nonconstrained minimizer of the least square objective function, denoted by $\hat\beta$. We derive closed exact formulae for the solution of the lasso under the full rank assumption. Our method does not assume iterative numerical procedures and it is, thus, computationally more efficient than the existing algorithms for solving the lasso. We also establish several important general properties of the solutions of the lasso. We prove that each lasso solution form a simple polygonal chain in $\mathbb{R}^p$ with $\hat\beta$ and the origin as the endpoints. There are no two segments of the polygonal chain that are parallel. We prove that such a polygonal chain can intersect interiors of more than one orthant in $\mathbb{R}^p$, but it cannot intersect interiors of more than $p$ orthants, which is, in general, the best possible estimate for non-normalized data. We prove that if a polygonal chain passes from the interior of one to the interior of another orthant, then it never again returns to the interior of the former. The intersection of a chain and the interior of an orthant coincides with a segment minus its end points, which belongs to a ray having $\hat\beta$ as its initial point. We illustrate the results using real data examples as well as especially crafted examples with hypothetical data. Already in $p=2$ case we show a striking difference in the maximal number of quadrants a polygonal chain of a lasso solution can intersect in the case of normalized data, which is $1$ vs. nonnormalized data, which is $2$.</description>

      <title>A fixed-time stable forward-backward dynamical system for solving generalized monotone inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a forward-backward splitting dynamical system for solving inclusion problems of the form $0\in A(x)+B(x)$ in Hilbert spaces, where $A$ is a maximal operator and $B$ is a single-valued operator. Involved operators are assumed to satisfy a generalized monotonicity condition, which is weaker than the standard monotone assumptions. Under mild conditions on parameters, we establish the fixed-time stability of the proposed dynamical system. In addition, we consider an explicit forward Euler discretization of the dynamical system leading to a new forward backward algorithm for which we present the convergence analysis. Applications to other optimization problems such as Constrained Optimization Problems (COPs), Mixed Variational Inequalities (MVIs), and Variational Inequalities (VIs) are presented and some numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Dynamic allocation function design in the presence of magnitude saturating inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter deals with the design of dynamic allocation functions for systems with saturating actuators. The goal of the allocator consists in redistributing the desired control effort within the multiple actuators by penalizing each actuator to be more or less used, while also taking into account a criterion for minimization of their total energy consumption over time. Anti-windup gains are added to both the controller and the dynamic allocator to deal with the saturation condition. Two cases are considered: the plant is affected by bounded disturbance and the influence matrix is supposed to be affected by uncertainty. Convex conditions for the co-design of both the dynamic allocator and anti-windup gains are then expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Such conditions allow to deal with the multiple objective problems of enlarging the estimates of the basin of attraction,  minimizing the total energy consumption of the actuators and maximizing the size of the admissible disturbance. The satellite formation problem borrowed from the literature is revised to illustrate the proposed technique and show its effectiveness in both cases (perturbed system and robust case).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal control problem for a model of tumor growth is studied. In a given subdomain, it is required to minimize the density of tumor cells, while the drug concentration in tissue is limited by given minimal and maximal values. Based on derived estimates of the solution of the controlled system, the solvability of the control problem is proved. The problem is reduced to an optimal control problem with a penalty. An algorithm for solving the optimal control problem with a penalty is constructed and implemented. The efficiency of the algorithm is illustrated by a numerical example.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contributions of this technical note are twofold. Firstly, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain a linear representation of a nonlinear vector field based on a system's trajectory. We also prove that its cost function is strictly convex, given the trajectory is persistently exciting. Under certain observability conditions, we provide results that guarantee the Hurwitz stability of the global minimizer. Secondly, we present a novel algorithm based on point-wise geometric flows to estimate the boundary of the region of attraction. We show that the algorithm converges to the exact boundary of the region of attraction under certain assumptions on the system dynamics. Finally, we validate the results using simulations on various nonlinear autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Optimality of vaccination for an SIR epidemic with an ICU constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal control problem for a class of SIR epidemic models, in scenarios in which the infected population is constrained to be lower than a critical threshold imposed by the ICU (intensive care unit) capacity. The vaccination effort possibly imposed by the health-care deciders is classically modeled by a control input affecting the epidemic dynamic. After a preliminary viability analysis the existence of optimal controls is established, and their structure is characterized by using a state-constrained version of Pontryagin's theorem. The resulting optimal controls necessarily have a bang-bang regime with at most one switch. More precisely, the optimal strategies impose the maximum-allowed vaccination effort in an initial period of time, which can cease only once the ICU constraint can be satisfied without further vaccination. The switching times are characterized in order to identify conditions under which vaccination should be implemented or halted. The uniqueness of the optimal control is also discussed. Numerical examples illustrate our theoretical results and the corresponding optimal strategies. The analysis is eventually extended to the infinite horizon by $\Gamma$-convergence arguments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a company can simultaneously reduce its emissions and buy carbon allowances at any time. We establish an optimal control model involving two stochastic processes with two control variables, which is a singular control problem. This model can then be converted into a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a two-dimensional variational equality with gradient barrier, so that the free boundary is a surface. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Finally, some numerical results are shown.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence of Adam and other adaptive stochastic gradient descent optimization methods for non-vanishing learning rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms - typically consisting of a class of deep neural networks trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays the key ingredients in many artificial intelligence (AI) systems and have revolutionized our ways of working and living in modern societies. For example, SGD methods are used to train powerful large language models (LLMs) such as versions of ChatGPT and Gemini, SGD methods are employed to create successful generative AI based text-to-image creation models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, but SGD methods are also used to train DNNs to approximately solve scientific models such as partial differential equation (PDE) models from physics and biology and optimal control and stopping problems from engineering. It is known that the plain vanilla standard SGD method fails to converge even in the situation of several convex optimization problems if the learning rates are bounded away from zero. However, in many practical relevant training scenarios, often not the plain vanilla standard SGD method but instead adaptive SGD methods such as the RMSprop and the Adam optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, are employed. This naturally rises the question whether such adaptive optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, do converge in the situation of non-vanishing learning rates. In this work we answer this question negatively by proving that adaptive SGD methods such as the popular Adam optimizer fail to converge to any possible random limit point if the learning rates are asymptotically bounded away from zero. In our proof of this non-convergence result we establish suitable pathwise a priori bounds for a class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods, which are also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Performance-Barrier Event-Triggered Control of a Class of Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the recent performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC) for achieving global exponential convergence of a class of reaction-diffusion PDEs via PDE backstepping control. Rather than insisting on a strictly monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system, P-ETC allows the Lyapunov function to increase as long as it remains below an acceptable performance-barrier. This approach integrates a performance residual, the difference between the value of the performance-barrier and the Lyapunov function, into the triggering mechanism. The integration adds flexibility and results in fewer control updates than with regular ETC (R-ETC) that demands a monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov function. Our P-ETC PDE backstepping design ensures global exponential convergence of the closed-loop system in the spatial L^2 norm, without encountering Zeno phenomenon. To avoid continuous monitoring of the triggering function that generates events, we develop periodic event-triggered and self-triggered variants (P-PETC and P-STC, respectively) of the P-ETC. The P-PETC only requires periodic evaluation of the triggering function whereas the P-STC preemptively computes the time of the next event at the current event time using the system model and continuously available system states. The P-PETC and P-STC also ensure a Zeno-free behavior and deliver performance equivalent to that of the continuous-time P-ETC which requires continuous evaluation of the triggering function, in addition to the continuous sensing of the state. We provide numerical simulations to illustrate the proposed technique and to compare it with R-ETC associated with strictly decreasing Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>How to beat a Bayesian adversary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks and other modern machine learning models are often susceptible to adversarial attacks. Indeed, an adversary may often be able to change a model's prediction through a small, directed perturbation of the model's input - an issue in safety-critical applications. Adversarially robust machine learning is usually based on a minmax optimisation problem that minimises the machine learning loss under maximisation-based adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we study adversaries that determine their attack using a Bayesian statistical approach rather than maximisation. The resulting Bayesian adversarial robustness problem is a relaxation of the usual minmax problem. To solve this problem, we propose Abram - a continuous-time particle system that shall approximate the gradient flow corresponding to the underlying learning problem. We show that Abram approximates a McKean-Vlasov process and justify the use of Abram by giving assumptions under which the McKean-Vlasov process finds the minimiser of the Bayesian adversarial robustness problem. We discuss two ways to discretise Abram and show its suitability in benchmark adversarial deep learning experiments.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Control System Theory and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.01367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a collection of the lecture notes of the three authors for a first-year graduate course on control system theory and design (ECE 515 , formerly ECE 415) at the ECE Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This is a fundamental course on the modern theory of dynamical systems and their control, and builds on a first-level course in control that emphasizes frequency-domain methods (such as the course ECE 486 , formerly ECE 386, at UIUC ). The emphasis in this graduate course is on state space techniques, and it encompasses modeling , analysis (of structural properties of systems, such as stability, controllability, and observability), synthesis (of observers/compensators and controllers) subject to design specifications, and optimization . Accordingly, this set of lecture notes is organized in four parts, with each part dealing with one of the issues identified above. Concentration is on linear systems , with nonlinear systems covered only in some specific contexts, such as stability and dynamic optimization. Both continuous-time and discrete-time systems are covered, with the former, however, in much greater depth than the latter.
  The main objective of this course is to teach the student some fundamental principles within a solid conceptual framework, that will enable her/him to design feedback loops compatible with the information available on the "states" of the system to be controlled, and by taking into account considerations such as stability, performance, energy conservation, and even robustness. A second objective is to familiarize her/him with the available modern computational, simulation, and general software tools that facilitate the design of effective feedback loops</description>

      <title>Exact Penalization at D-Stationary Points of Cardinality- or Rank-Constrained Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of d-stationary points of the trimmed lasso (Luo et al., 2013, Huang et al., 2015, and Gotoh et al., 2018) and the composite optimization problem with the truncated nuclear norm (Gao and Sun, 2010, and Zhang et al., 2012), which are known as tight relaxations of nonconvex optimization problems that have either cardinality or rank constraints, respectively. First, we extend the trimmed lasso for broader applications and for conducting a unified analysis of the property of the generalized trimmed lasso. Next, the equivalence between local optimality and d-stationarity of the generalized trimmed lasso is shown under a suitable assumption. More generally, the equivalence is shown for problems that minimize a function defined by the pointwise minimum of finitely many convex functions. Then, we present new results of the exact penalty at d-stationary points of the generalized trimmed lasso and the problem with the truncated nuclear norm penalty under mild assumptions. Our exact penalty results are not only new, but also intuitive, so that we can see what properties of the problems play a role for establishing the exact penalization. Lastly, matters relating to algorithms are also discussed.</description>

      <title>$\ell_p$-sphere covering and approximating nuclear $p$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral $p$-norm and nuclear $p$-norm of matrices and tensors appear in various applications albeit both are NP-hard to compute. The former sets a foundation of $\ell_p$-sphere constrained polynomial optimization problems and the latter has been found in many rank minimization problems in machine learning. We study approximation algorithms of the tensor nuclear $p$-norm with an aim to establish the approximation bound matching the best one of its dual norm, the tensor spectral $p$-norm. Driven by the application of sphere covering to approximate both tensor spectral and nuclear norms ($p=2$), we propose several types of hitting sets that approximately represent $\ell_p$-sphere with adjustable parameters for different levels of approximations and cardinalities, providing an independent toolbox for decision making on $\ell_p$-spheres. Using the idea in robust optimization and second-order cone programming, we obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm with an $\Omega(1)$-approximation bound for the computation of the matrix nuclear $p$-norm when $p\in(2,\infty)$ is a rational, paving a way for applications in modeling with the matrix nuclear $p$-norm. These two new results enable us to propose various polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the computation of the tensor nuclear $p$-norm using tensor partitions, convex optimization and duality theory, attaining the same approximation bound to the best one of the tensor spectral $p$-norm. We believe the ideas of $\ell_p$-sphere covering with its applications in approximating nuclear $p$-norm would be useful to tackle optimization problems on other sets such as the binary hypercube with its applications in graph theory and neural networks, the nonnegative sphere with its applications in copositive programming and nonnegative matrix factorization.</description>

      <title>An Exact Framework for Solving the Space-Time Dependent TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world scenarios involve solving bi-level optimization problems in which there is an outer discrete optimization problem, and an inner problem involving expensive or black-box computation. This arises in space-time dependent variants of the Traveling Salesman Problem, such as when planning space missions that visit multiple astronomical objects. Planning these missions presents significant challenges due to the constant relative motion of the objects involved. There is an outer combinatorial problem of finding the optimal order to visit the objects and an inner optimization problem that requires finding the optimal departure time and trajectory to travel between each pair of objects. The constant motion of the objects complicates the inner problem, making it computationally expensive. This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing decision diagrams (DDs) and a DD-based branch-and-bound technique, Peel-and-Bound, to achieve exact solutions for such bi-level optimization problems, assuming sufficient inner problem optimizer quality. The framework leverages problem-specific knowledge to expedite search processes and minimize the number of expensive evaluations required. As a case study, we apply this framework to the Asteroid Routing Problem (ARP), a benchmark problem in global trajectory optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's scalability and ability to generate robust heuristic solutions for ARP instances. Many of these solutions are exact, contingent on the assumed quality of the inner problem's optimizer.</description>

      <title>A Distributed ADMM-based Deep Learning Approach for Thermal Control in Multi-Zone Buildings under Demand Response Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing electricity use and reliance on intermittent renewable energy sources challenge power grid management during peak demand, making Demand Response programs and energy conservation measures essential. This research combines distributed optimization using ADMM with deep learning models to plan indoor temperature setpoints effectively. A two-layer hierarchical structure is used, with a central building coordinator at the upper layer and local controllers at the thermal zone layer. The coordinator must limit the building's maximum power by translating the building's total power to local power targets for each zone. Local controllers can modify the temperature setpoints to meet the local power targets. While most algorithms are either centralized or require prior knowledge about the building's structure, our approach is distributed and fully data-driven. The proposed algorithm, called Distributed Planning Networks, is designed to be both adaptable and scalable to many types of buildings, tackling two of the main challenges in the development of such systems. The proposed approach is tested on an 18-zone building modeled in EnergyPlus. The algorithm successfully manages Demand Response peak events.</description>

      <title>Universal Gradient Methods for Stochastic Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop universal gradient methods for Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO). Our algorithms automatically adapt not only to the oracle's noise but also to the H\"older smoothness of the objective function without a priori knowledge of the particular setting. The key ingredient is a novel strategy for adjusting step-size coefficients in the Stochastic Gradient Method (SGD). Unlike AdaGrad, which accumulates gradient norms, our Universal Gradient Method accumulates appropriate combinations of gradient- and iterate differences. The resulting algorithm has state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate guarantees for the entire H\"older class including, in particular, both nonsmooth functions and those with Lipschitz continuous gradient. We also present the Universal Fast Gradient Method for SCO enjoying optimal efficiency estimates.</description>

      <title>Complexity results and active-set identification of a derivative-free method for bound-constrained problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a derivative-free line search method designed for bound-constrained problems. Our analysis demonstrates that this method exhibits a worst-case complexity comparable to other derivative-free methods for unconstrained and linearly constrained problems. In particular, when minimizing a function with $n$ variables, we prove that at most ${\cal O}(n\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations are needed to drive a criticality measure below a predefined threshold $\epsilon$, requiring at most ${\cal O}(n^2\epsilon^{-2})$ function evaluations. We also show that the total number of iterations where the criticality measure is not below $\epsilon$ is upper bounded by ${\cal O}(n^2\epsilon^{-2})$. Moreover, we investigate the method capability to identify active constraints at the final solutions. We show that, after a finite number of iterations, all the active constraints satisfying the strict complementarity condition are correctly identified.</description>

      <title>High-Precision, Fair University Course Scheduling During a Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scheduling university courses is extra challenging when classroom capacities are reduced because of social distancing requirements that are implemented in response to a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this work, we propose an expanded taxonomy of course delivery modes, present an integer program, and develop a course scheduling algorithm to enable all course sections -- even the largest -- to have a significant classroom learning component during a pandemic. Our approach is fair by ensuring that a certain fraction of the instruction in every course section occurs in the classroom. Unlike previous studies, we do not allow rotating attendance and instead require simultaneous attendance in which all students in a section meet in 1-5 rooms at the same time but less often than in a normal semester. These mass meetings, which create opportunities for in-person midterm exams and group activities, are scheduled at high precision across all days of the semester rather than a single, repeating week. A fast heuristic algorithm makes the schedule in an hour. Results: We consider the 1834 in-person course sections, 172 classrooms, and 96 days in the fall 2022 semester at [UniversityXYZ]. If average classroom capacity is reduced by 75% due to a pandemic, our approach still allows at least 25% of the instruction in every section, and more than 49% of all instruction across the entire campus, to be in the classroom. Our method also produces excellent results for regular classroom assignment. Managerial implications: An algorithm based on the principles of fairness and simultaneous attendance can significantly improve university course schedules during a pandemic and in normal times. High-precision schedules that prepare a campus for various pandemic possibilities can be created with minimal administrative effort and activated at a moment's notice before or during a semester if an outbreak occurs.</description>

      <title>Real-time MPC with Control Barrier Functions for Autonomous Driving using Safety Enhanced Collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The autonomous driving industry is continuously dealing with safety-critical scenarios, and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a powerful control strategy for handling such situations. However, standard safety constraints are not scalable and require a long NMPC horizon. Moreover, the adoption of NMPC in the automotive industry is limited by the heavy computation of numerical optimization routines. To address those issues, this paper presents a real-time capable NMPC for automated driving in urban environments, using control barrier functions (CBFs). Furthermore, the designed NMPC is based on a novel collocation transcription approach, named RESAFE/COL, that allows to reduce the number of optimization variables while still guaranteeing the continuous time (nonlinear) inequality constraints satisfaction, through regional convex hull approximation. RESAFE/COL is proven to be 5 times faster than multiple shooting and more tractable for embedded hardware without a decrease in the performance, nor accuracy and safety of the numerical solution. We validate our NMPC-CBF with RESAFE/COL on digital twins of the vehicle and the urban environment and show the safe controller's ability to improve crash avoidance by 91\%.

      <title>Automatic Outlier Rectification via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel conceptual framework to detect outliers using optimal transport with a concave cost function. Conventional outlier detection approaches typically use a two-stage procedure: first, outliers are detected and removed, and then estimation is performed on the cleaned data. However, this approach does not inform outlier removal with the estimation task, leaving room for improvement. To address this limitation, we propose an automatic outlier rectification mechanism that integrates rectification and estimation within a joint optimization framework. We take the first step to utilize the optimal transport distance with a concave cost function to construct a rectification set in the space of probability distributions. Then, we select the best distribution within the rectification set to perform the estimation task. Notably, the concave cost function we introduced in this paper is the key to making our estimator effectively identify the outlier during the optimization process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over conventional approaches in simulations and empirical analyses for mean estimation, least absolute regression, and the fitting of option implied volatility surfaces.</description>

      <title>New algorithms for sampling and diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing from the theory of stochastic differential equations, we introduce a novel sampling method for known distributions and a new algorithm for diffusion generative models with unknown distributions. Our approach is inspired by the concept of the reverse diffusion process, widely adopted in diffusion generative models. Additionally, we derive the explicit convergence rate based on the smooth ODE flow. For diffusion generative models and sampling, we establish a dimension-free particle approximation convergence result. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, unlike the traditional Langevin method, our sampling method does not require any regularity assumptions about the density function of the target distribution. Furthermore, we also apply our method to optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoanisotropic estimates for fundamental frequencies of membranes and connections with shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The underlying motivation of the present work lies on one of the cornerstone problems in spectral optimization that consists of determining sharp lower and upper uniform estimates for fundamental frequencies of a set of uniformly elliptic operators on a given membrane. Our approach allows to give a complete solution of the problem for the general class of anisotropic operators in divergence form generated by arbitrary norms on R^2, including the computation of optimal constants and the characterization of all anisotropic extremizers. Such achievements demand that isoanisotropic type problems be addressed within the broader environment of nonnegative, convex and 1-homogeneous anisotropies and involve a deep and fine analysis of least energy levels associated to anisotropies with maximum degeneracy. As a central outcome we find out a key close relation between shapes and fundamental frequencies for rather degenerate elliptic operators. Our findings also permit to establish that the supremum of anisotropic fundamental frequencies over all fixed-area membranes is infinite for any nonzero anisotropy. This particularly proves the well-known maximization conjecture for fundamental frequencies of the p-laplacian for any p other than 2. Our new sharp lower estimate is just the planar isoanisotropic counterpart of the Faber-Krahn isoperimetric inequality and for the associated optimal constant we provide optimal geometric controls through isodiametric and isoperimetric shape optimization.</description>
