      <title>Variational Bayesian Learning Based Localization and Channel Reconstruction in RIS-aided Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging immersive and autonomous services have posed stringent requirements on both communications and localization. By considering the great potential of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), this paper focuses on the joint channel estimation and localization for RIS-aided wireless systems. As opposed to existing works that treat channel estimation and localization independently, this paper exploits the intrinsic coupling and nonlinear relationships between the channel parameters and user location for enhancement of both localization and channel reconstruction. By noticing the non-convex, nonlinear objective function and the sparser angle pattern, a variational Bayesian learning-based framework is developed to jointly estimate the channel parameters and user location through leveraging an effective approximation of the posterior distribution. The proposed framework is capable of unifying near-field and far-field scenarios owing to exploitation of sparsity of the angular domain. Since the joint channel and location estimation problem has a closed-form solution in each iteration, our proposed iterative algorithm performs better than the conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO) and maximum likelihood (ML) based ones in terms of computational complexity. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm almost reaches the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) and achieves a superior estimation accuracy by comparing to the PSO and the ML algorithms.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Deep Learning Augmented Wireless Channel Estimation for Pilot-Based OFDM on Zynq System on Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation (CE) is one of the critical signal-processing tasks of the wireless physical layer (PHY). Recent deep learning (DL) based CE have outperformed statistical approaches such as least-square-based CE (LS) and linear minimum mean square error-based CE (LMMSE). However, existing CE approaches have not yet been realized on system-on-chip (SoC). The first contribution of this paper is to efficiently implement the existing state-of-the-art CE algorithms on Zynq SoC (ZSoC), comprising of ARM processor and field programmable gate array (FPGA), via hardware-software co-design and fixed point analysis. We validate the superiority of DL-based CE and LMMSE over LS for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and wireless channels in terms of mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER). We also highlight the high complexity, execution time, and power consumption of DL-based CE and LMMSE approaches. To address this, we propose a novel compute-efficient LS-augmented interpolated deep neural network (LSiDNN) based CE algorithm and realize it on ZSoC. The proposed LSiDNN offers 88-90% lower execution time and 38-85% lower resource utilization than state-of-the-art DL-based CE for identical MSE and BER. LSiDNN offers significantly lower MSE and BER than LMMSE, and the gain improves with increased mobility between transceivers. It offers 75% lower execution time and 90-94% lower resource utilization than LMMSE.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Interactive Resilient Fusion Algorithm Based on RIEKF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of heterogeneous redundant sensors on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) increases, onboard sensors require a more rational and efficient credibility evaluation system and a resilient fusion framework to achieve the essence of seamless sensor group switching. A simple and efficient sensor credibility evaluation system is proposed to guide the selection of the optimal multi-source sensor submodel combination, thereby providing key model prior knowledge for multi-source resilient fusion. Furthermore, a multi-model interactive resilient fusion framework based on RIEKF is proposed, utilizing the defined sensor credibility indexes to guide the design of the model transition probability matrix, thereby reducing the sensitivity of submodel weights to fusion stability and solving the problem of the model transition matrix lacking a basis for adjustment. Model weights are updated in real time through credibility prior information and submodel posterior probabilities, thus leveraging the adaptive resilience advantage between models to achieve seamless switching between submodels in complex environments. Experimental results show that the algorithm presented in this paper, without using any sensor fault diagnosis and isolation logic, without setting any complex detection timing and thresholds, demonstrates a resilience advantage, thereby enhancing the adaptability of the state estimation system in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning-Enhanced Instantaneous Multi-Person Indoor Localization by CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive indoor localization, integral to smart buildings, emergency response, and indoor navigation, has traditionally been limited by a focus on single-target localization and reliance on multi-packet CSI. We introduce a novel Multi-target loss, notably enhancing multi-person localization. Utilizing this loss function, our instantaneous CSI-ResNet achieves an impressive 99.21% accuracy at 0.6m precision with single-timestamp CSI. A preprocessing algorithm is implemented to counteract WiFi-induced variability, thereby augmenting robustness. Furthermore, we incorporate Nuclear Norm-Based Transfer Pre-Training, ensuring adaptability in diverse environments, which provides a new paradigm for indoor multi-person localization. Additionally, we have developed an extensive dataset, surpassing existing ones in scope and diversity, to underscore the efficacy of our method and facilitate future fingerprint-based localization research.</description>

      <title>Blockage-Aware Robust Beamforming in RIS-Aided Mobile Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are sensitive to blockage over radio propagation paths. The emerging paradigm of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has the potential to overcome this issue by its ability to arbitrarily reflect the incident signals toward desired directions. This paper proposes a Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion-based blockage-aware algorithm to improve communication resilience against blockage in mobile mmWave multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. By virtue of this pragmatic blockage-aware technique, we further propose an outage-constrained beamforming design for downlink mmWave MIMO transmission to achieve outage probability minimization and achievable rate maximization. To minimize the outage probability, a robust RIS beamformer with variant beamwidth is designed to combat uncertain channel state information (CSI). For the rate maximization problem, an accelerated projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm is developed to solve the computational challenge of high-dimensional RIS phase-shift matrix (PSM) optimization. Particularly, we leverage a subspace constraint to reduce the scope of the projection operation and formulate a new Nesterov momentum acceleration scheme to speed up the convergence process of PGD. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed blockage-aware approach, and the proposed accelerated PGD algorithm outperforms a number of representative baseline algorithms in terms of the achievable rate.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-inverse reconstruction of bandlimited signals from nonuniform generalized samples with orthogonal kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to the traditional pursuit of research on nonuniform sampling of bandlimited signals, the objective of the present paper is not to find sampling conditions that permit perfect reconstruction, but to perform the best possible signal recovery from any given set of nonuniform samples, whether it is finite as in practice, or infinite to achieve the possibility of unique reconstruction in $L^2({\bf R})$. This leads us to consider the pseudo-inverse of the whole sampling map as a linear operator of Hilbert spaces. We propose in this paper an iterative algorithm that systematically performs this pseudo-inversion under the following conditions: (i) the input lies in some closed space $\cal A$ (such as a space of bandlimited functions); (ii) the samples are formed by inner product of the input with given kernel functions; (iii) these functions are orthogonal at least in a Hilbert space $\cal H$ that is larger than $\cal A$. This situation turns out to appear in certain time encoders that are part of the increasingly important area of event-based sampling. As a result of pseudo-inversion, we systematically achieve perfect reconstruction whenever the samples uniquely characterize the input, we obtain minimal-norm estimates when the sampling is insufficient, and the reconstruction errors are controlled in the case of noisy sampling. The algorithm consists in alternating two projections according to the general method of projections onto convex sets (POCS) and can be implemented by iterating time-varying discrete-time filtering. We finally show that our signal and sampling assumptions appear in a nontrivial manner in other existing problems of data acquisition. This includes multi-channel time encoding where $\cal H$ is of the type $L^2({\bf R})^M$, and traditional point sampling with the adoption of a Sobolev space $\cal H$.</description>

      <title>PowerSkel: A Device-Free Framework Using CSI Signal for Human Skeleton Estimation in Power Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety monitoring of power operations in power stations is crucial for preventing accidents and ensuring stable power supply. However, conventional methods such as wearable devices and video surveillance have limitations such as high cost, dependence on light, and visual blind spots. WiFi-based human pose estimation is a suitable method for monitoring power operations due to its low cost, device-free, and robustness to various illumination conditions.In this paper, a novel Channel State Information (CSI)-based pose estimation framework, namely PowerSkel, is developed to address these challenges. PowerSkel utilizes self-developed CSI sensors to form a mutual sensing network and constructs a CSI acquisition scheme specialized for power scenarios. It significantly reduces the deployment cost and complexity compared to the existing solutions. To reduce interference with CSI in the electricity scenario, a sparse adaptive filtering algorithm is designed to preprocess the CSI. CKDformer, a knowledge distillation network based on collaborative learning and self-attention, is proposed to extract the features from CSI and establish the mapping relationship between CSI and keypoints. The experiments are conducted in a real-world power station, and the results show that the PowerSkel achieves high performance with a PCK@50 of 96.27%, and realizes a significant visualization on pose estimation, even in dark environments. Our work provides a novel low-cost and high-precision pose estimation solution for power operation.</description>

      <title>Continuous emission ultrasound: a new paradigm to ultrafast ultrasound imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current imaging techniques in echography rely on the pulse-echo (PE) paradigm which provides a straight-forward access to the in-depth structure of tissues. They inherently face two major challenges: the limitation of the pulse repetition frequency, directly linked to the imaging framerate, and, due to the emission scheme, their blindness to the phenomena that happen in the medium during the majority of the acquisition time. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new paradigm for ultrasound imaging, denoted by continuous emission ultrasound imaging (CUEI) \cite{CEUIpatent2023}, for a single input single output (SISO) device.
  A continuous insonification of the medium is done by the probe using a coded waveform inspired from the radar and sonar literature. A framework coupling a sliding window approach (SWA) and pulse compression methods processes the recorded echoes to rebuild a motion-mode (M-mode) image from the medium with a high temporal resolution compared to state-of-the-art ultrafast imaging methods.
  A study on realistic simulated data, with regards to the motion of the medium, has been carried out and, achieved results assess an unequivocal improvement of the slow time frequency up to, at least, two orders of magnitude compared to ultrafast US imaging methods. This enhancement leads, therefore, to a ten times improvement in the temporal separability of the imaging system. In addition, it demonstrates the capability of CEUI to catch relatively short and quick events, in comparison to the imaging period of PE methods, at any instant of the acquisition.</description>

      <title>Target Localization and Performance Trade-Offs in Cooperative ISAC Systems: A Scheme Based on 5G NR OFDM Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of sensing capabilities into communication systems, by sharing physical resources, has a significant potential for reducing spectrum, hardware, and energy costs while inspiring innovative applications. Cooperative networks, in particular, are expected to enhance sensing services by enlarging the coverage area and enriching sensing measurements, thus improving the service availability and accuracy. This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework by leveraging information-carrying orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals transmitted by access points (APs). Specifically, we propose a two-stage scheme for target localization, where communication signals are reused as sensing reference signals based on the system information shared at the central processing unit (CPU). In Stage I, we measure the ranges of scattered paths induced by targets, through the extraction of time-delay information from the received signals at APs. Then, the target locations are estimated in Stage II based on these range measurements. Considering that the scattered paths corresponding to some targets may not be detectable by all APs, we propose an effective algorithm to match the range measurements with the targets and achieve the target location estimation. Notably, by analyzing the OFDM numerologies defined in fifth generation (5G) standards, we elucidate the flexibility and consistency of performance trade-offs in both communication and sensing aspects. Finally, numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our sensing scheme and the cooperative gain of the ISAC framework.</description>

      <title>Array Coupling in Terms of Characteristic Modes and Generalized Scattering Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of mutual coupling in antenna arrays using generalized scattering matrices in terms of characteristic modes is proposed. Potential applications of this model are diverse. On the one hand, the proposed model can be used as a basis for mutual coupling calculation methods. On the other hand, the parameters introduced by the model provide a new intermediate level to understand coupling phenomena at a higher and more abstract level. After introducing the model, the question of how to describe the degrees of freedom of an antenna in this model is addressed. For this purpose, a formalism to synthesize antennas from a predefined geometry with still undefined ports is mathematically formulated. Furthermore, three exemplary applications of the model are given. A first example illustrates the accuracy of the model and the validity of the implementation. A second example illustrates the intuitiveness of the model based on a simple application, and a third example shows the application to a complex real-world design problem of a circularly polarized patch antenna array.</description>

      <title>Preserving Smart Grid Integrity: A Differential Privacy Framework for Secure Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in the Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework based on differential privacy (DP) for querying electric power measurements to detect system anomalies or bad data caused by false data injections (FDIs). Our DP approach conceals consumption and system matrix data, while simultaneously enabling an untrusted third party to test hypotheses of anomalies, such as an FDI attack, by releasing a randomized sufficient statistic for hypothesis-testing. We consider a measurement model corrupted by Gaussian noise and a sparse noise vector representing the attack, and we observe that the optimal test statistic is a chi-square random variable. To detect possible attacks, we propose a novel DP chi-square noise mechanism that ensures the test does not reveal private information about power injections or the system matrix. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for detecting FDIs while preserving the privacy of sensitive power system data.</description>

      <title>Time-bound Contextual Bio-ID Generation for Minimalist Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wearable devices become increasingly miniaturized and powerful, a new opportunity arises for instant and dynamic device-to-device collaboration and human-to-device interaction. However, this progress presents a unique challenge: these minimalist wearables lack inherent mechanisms for real-time authentication, posing significant risks to data privacy and overall security. To address this, we introduce Proteus that realizes an innovative concept of time-bound contextual bio-IDs, which are generated from on-device sensor data and embedded into a common latent space. These bio-IDs act as a time-bound unique user identifier that can be used to identify the wearer in a certain context. Proteus enables dynamic and contextual device collaboration as well as robust human-to-device interaction. Our evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, particularly in the context of minimalist wearables.</description>

      <title>On Non-Interactive Simulation of Distributed Sources with Finite Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Fourier analysis framework for the non-interactive source simulation (NISS) problem. Two distributed agents observe a pair of sequences $X^d$ and $Y^d$ drawn according to a joint distribution $P_{X^dY^d}$. The agents aim to generate outputs $U=f_d(X^d)$ and $V=g_d(Y^d)$ with a joint distribution sufficiently close in total variation to a target distribution $Q_{UV}$. Existing works have shown that the NISS problem with finite-alphabet outputs is decidable. For the binary-output NISS, an upper-bound to the input complexity was derived which is $O(\exp\operatorname{poly}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$. In this work, the input complexity and algorithm design are addressed in several classes of NISS scenarios. For binary-output NISS scenarios with doubly-symmetric binary inputs, it is shown that the input complexity is $\Theta(\log{\frac{1}{\epsilon}})$, thus providing a super-exponential improvement in input complexity. An explicit characterization of the simulating pair of functions is provided. For general finite-input scenarios, a constructive algorithm is introduced that explicitly finds the simulating functions $(f_d(X^d),g_d(Y^d))$. The approach relies on a novel Fourier analysis framework. Various numerical simulations of NISS scenarios with IID inputs are provided. Furthermore, to illustrate the general applicability of the Fourier framework, several examples with non-IID inputs, including entanglement-assisted NISS and NISS with Markovian inputs are provided.</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of SEANet: a Software-defined Networking Platform for the Internet of Underwater Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating and safeguarding our oceans is vital for a host of applications and tasks, including combating climate change, ensuring the integrity of subsea infrastructures, and for coastal protection. Achieving these essential functions depends on the deployment of cost-effective, versatile underwater sensor networks that can efficiently collect and transmit data to land. However, the success of such networks is currently hindered by the significant limitations of existing underwater modems, which limits their operational use to a narrow range of applications. This paper presents and evaluates the performance of the SEANet software-defined networking platform, for the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), addressing the limitations of existing underwater communication technologies. It presents the development and comprehensive testing of an adaptable, high-data-rate, and integration-friendly underwater platform that reconfigures in real-time to meet the demands of various marine applications. With an acoustic front end, the platform significantly outperforms conventional modems, achieving more than double the data rate at 150 kbit/s. Experiments conducted in oceanic conditions demonstrate its capabilities in channel characterization, OFDM link establishment, and compatibility with the JANUS communication standard. Our platform advances the IoUT by providing a versatile, scalable solution that can incorporate multiple physical layers and support an array of tasks, making it pivotal for real-time ocean data analysis and the expansion of ocean-related digital applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a signal analysis concept is derived when revisiting how a specific frequency component in spectrum is analyzed in Fourier analysis. Three signal analysis methods are then developed based on the derived concept, namely Arbitrary Discrete Fourier Analysis (ADFA), Mel-scale Discrete Fourier Analysis (MDFA), and constant Q Analysis (CQA). I validate the effectiveness of these three signal analysis methods by testing their performance on a replayed speech detection benchmark (i.e., the ASVspoof 2019 Physical Access) along with a state-of-the-art model. Experimental results show that the performance of these three signal analysis methods is comparable to the best reported systems. At the same time, it is show that the computation time of the developed method CQA is much shorter than the convention method constant Q Transform, which is commonly used in spoofed and fake speech detection and music processing.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models as Virtual Annotators for Time-series Physical Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional human-in-the-loop-based annotation for time-series data like inertial data often requires access to alternate modalities like video or audio from the environment. These alternate sources provide the necessary information to the human annotator, as the raw numeric data is often too obfuscated even for an expert. However, this traditional approach has many concerns surrounding overall cost, efficiency, storage of additional modalities, time, scalability, and privacy. Interestingly, recent large language models (LLMs) are also trained with vast amounts of publicly available alphanumeric data, which allows them to comprehend and perform well on tasks beyond natural language processing. Naturally, this opens up a potential avenue to explore LLMs as virtual annotators where the LLMs will be directly provided the raw sensor data for annotation instead of relying on any alternate modality. Naturally, this could mitigate the problems of the traditional human-in-the-loop approach. Motivated by this observation, we perform a detailed study in this paper to assess whether the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs can be used as virtual annotators for labeling time-series physical sensing data. To perform this in a principled manner, we segregate the study into two major phases. In the first phase, we investigate the challenges an LLM like GPT-4 faces in comprehending raw sensor data. Considering the observations from phase 1, in the next phase, we investigate the possibility of encoding the raw sensor data using SOTA SSL approaches and utilizing the projected time-series data to get annotations from the LLM. Detailed evaluation with four benchmark HAR datasets shows that SSL-based encoding and metric-based guidance allow the LLM to make more reasonable decisions and provide accurate annotations without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning or sophisticated prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>REWIND Dataset: Privacy-preserving Speaking Status Segmentation from Multimodal Body Movement Signals in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing speaking in humans is a central task towards understanding social interactions. Ideally, speaking would be detected from individual voice recordings, as done previously for meeting scenarios. However, individual voice recordings are hard to obtain in the wild, especially in crowded mingling scenarios due to cost, logistics, and privacy concerns. As an alternative, machine learning models trained on video and wearable sensor data make it possible to recognize speech by detecting its related gestures in an unobtrusive, privacy-preserving way. These models themselves should ideally be trained using labels obtained from the speech signal. However, existing mingling datasets do not contain high quality audio recordings. Instead, speaking status annotations have often been inferred by human annotators from video, without validation of this approach against audio-based ground truth. In this paper we revisit no-audio speaking status estimation by presenting the first publicly available multimodal dataset with high-quality individual speech recordings of 33 subjects in a professional networking event. We present three baselines for no-audio speaking status segmentation: a) from video, b) from body acceleration (chest-worn accelerometer), c) from body pose tracks. In all cases we predict a 20Hz binary speaking status signal extracted from the audio, a time resolution not available in previous datasets. In addition to providing the signals and ground truth necessary to evaluate a wide range of speaking status detection methods, the availability of audio in REWIND makes it suitable for cross-modality studies not feasible with previous mingling datasets. Finally, our flexible data consent setup creates new challenges for multimodal systems under missing modalities.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition using Advanced Deep Learning Approaches: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have posed a significant challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR). ASR relies on extensive training datasets, including confidential ones, and demands substantial computational and storage resources. Enabling adaptive systems improves ASR performance in dynamic environments. DL techniques assume training and testing data originate from the same domain, which is not always true. Advanced DL techniques like deep transfer learning (DTL), federated learning (FL), and reinforcement learning (RL) address these issues. DTL allows high-performance models using small yet related datasets, FL enables training on confidential data without dataset possession, and RL optimizes decision-making in dynamic environments, reducing computation costs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of DTL, FL, and RL-based ASR frameworks, aiming to provide insights into the latest developments and aid researchers and professionals in understanding the current challenges. Additionally, transformers, which are advanced DL techniques heavily used in proposed ASR frameworks, are considered in this survey for their ability to capture extensive dependencies in the input ASR sequence. The paper starts by presenting the background of DTL, FL, RL, and Transformers and then adopts a well-designed taxonomy to outline the state-of-the-art approaches. Subsequently, a critical analysis is conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each framework. Additionally, a comparative study is presented to highlight the existing challenges, paving the way for future research opportunities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization is a critical task in many embedded applications, such as asset tracking, emergency response, and realtime navigation. In this article, we propose a novel fingerprintingbased framework for indoor localization called SANGRIA that uses stacked autoencoder neural networks with gradient boosted trees. Our approach is designed to overcome the device heterogeneity challenge that can create uncertainty in wireless signal measurements across embedded devices used for localization. We compare SANGRIA to several state-of-the-art frameworks and demonstrate 42.96% lower average localization error across diverse indoor locales and heterogeneous devices.</description>

      <title>LUM-ViT: Learnable Under-sampling Mask Vision Transformer for Bandwidth Limited Optical Signal Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandwidth constraints during signal acquisition frequently impede real-time detection applications. Hyperspectral data is a notable example, whose vast volume compromises real-time hyperspectral detection. To tackle this hurdle, we introduce a novel approach leveraging pre-acquisition modulation to reduce the acquisition volume. This modulation process is governed by a deep learning model, utilizing prior information. Central to our approach is LUM-ViT, a Vision Transformer variant. Uniquely, LUM-ViT incorporates a learnable under-sampling mask tailored for pre-acquisition modulation. To further optimize for optical calculations, we propose a kernel-level weight binarization technique and a three-stage fine-tuning strategy. Our evaluations reveal that, by sampling a mere 10% of the original image pixels, LUM-ViT maintains the accuracy loss within 1.8% on the ImageNet classification task. The method sustains near-original accuracy when implemented on real-world optical hardware, demonstrating its practicality. Code will be available at https://github.com/MaxLLF/LUM-ViT.</description>

      <title>Localization matters too: How localization error affects UAV flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum safe flight speed of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an important indicator for measuring its efficiency in completing various tasks. This indicator is influenced by numerous parameters such as UAV localization error, perception range, and system latency. However, in terms of localization errors, although there have been many studies dedicated to improving the localization capability of UAVs, there is a lack of quantitative research on their impact on speed. In this work, we model the relationship between various parameters of the UAV and its maximum flight speed. We consider a scenario similar to navigating through dense forests, where the UAV needs to quickly avoid obstacles directly ahead and swiftly reorient after avoidance. Based on this scenario, we studied how parameters such as localization error affect the maximum safe speed during UAV flight, as well as the coupling relationships between these parameters. Furthermore, we validated our model in a simulation environment, and the results showed that the predicted maximum safe speed had an error of less than 20% compared to the test speed. In high-density situations, localization error has a significant impact on the UAV's maximum safe flight speed. This model can help designers utilize more suitable software and hardware to construct a UAV system.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Design of Uplink Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the issue of uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G wireless networks where the sensing echo signal and the communication signal are received simultaneously at the base station (BS). To effectively mitigate the mutual interference between sensing and communication caused by the sharing of spectrum and hardware resources, we provide a joint sensing transmit waveform and communication receive beamforming design with the objective of maximizing the weighted sum of normalized sensing rate and normalized communication rate. It is formulated as a computationally complicated non-convex optimization problem, which is quite difficult to be solved by conventional optimization methods. To this end, we first make a series of equivalent transformation on the optimization problem to reduce the design complexity, and then develop a deep learning (DL)-based scheme to enhance the overall performance of ISAC. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DL-based scheme for ISAC in 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Normalising Flow-based Differentiable Particle Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in incorporating neural networks into particle filters, e.g. differentiable particle filters, to perform joint sequential state estimation and model learning for non-linear non-Gaussian state-space models in complex environments. Existing differentiable particle filters are mostly constructed with vanilla neural networks that do not allow density estimation. As a result, they are either restricted to a bootstrap particle filtering framework or employ predefined distribution families (e.g. Gaussian distributions), limiting their performance in more complex real-world scenarios. In this paper we present a differentiable particle filtering framework that uses (conditional) normalising flows to build its dynamic model, proposal distribution, and measurement model. This not only enables valid probability densities but also allows the proposed method to adaptively learn these modules in a flexible way, without being restricted to predefined distribution families. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed filters and evaluate the proposed normalising flow-based differentiable particle filters' performance through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise estimation of cardiac patients' current and future comorbidities is an important factor in prioritizing continuous physiological monitoring and new therapies. ML models have shown satisfactory performance in short-term mortality prediction of patients with heart disease, while their utility in long-term predictions is limited. This study aims to investigate the performance of tree-based ML models on long-term mortality prediction and the effect of two recently introduced biomarkers on long-term mortality. This study utilized publicly available data from CCHIA at the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan, China. Medical records were used to gather demographic and clinical data, including age, gender, BMI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) status, and comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and non-STEMI. Using medical and demographic records as well as two recently introduced biomarkers, brachial pre-ejection period (bPEP) and brachial ejection time (bET), collected from 139 patients with acute myocardial infarction, we investigated the performance of advanced ensemble tree-based ML algorithms (random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost) to predict all-cause mortality within 14 years. The developed ML models achieved significantly better performance compared to the baseline LR (C-Statistic, 0.80 for random forest, 0.79 for AdaBoost, and 0.78 for XGBoost, vs 0.77 for LR) (P-RF&lt;0.001, PAdaBoost&lt;0.001, PXGBoost&lt;0.05). Adding bPEP and bET to our feature set significantly improved the algorithms' performance, leading to an absolute increase in C-Statistic of up to 0.03 (C-Statistic, 0.83 for random forest, 0.82 for AdaBoost, and 0.80 for XGBoost, vs 0.74 for LR) (P-RF&lt;0.001, PAdaBoost&lt;0.001, PXGBoost&lt;0.05). This advancement may enable better treatment prioritization for high-risk individuals.</description>

      <title>Respiratory motion forecasting with online learning of recurrent neural networks for safety enhancement in externally guided radiotherapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can record the location of reflective objects on the chest to infer the position of the tumor moving due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), is a potential solution as it can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D position of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI based on compression of the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and an accurate update of the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. The original sampling frequency was 10Hz; we performed resampling at 3.33Hz and 30Hz. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) h&lt;=2.1s and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSE) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the highest accuracy at 30Hz, with an nRMSE of 0.0897. DNI's inference time, equal to 6.8ms per time step at 30Hz (Intel Core i7-13700 CPU), was the lowest among the RNN methods examined.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive RIS Transmitter Enabled Energy-Efficient Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transmitter enabled downlink multi-user communication system is investigated. Specifically, RISs are exploited to serve as transmitter antennas, where each element can flexibly switch between active and passive modes to deliver information to multiple users. The system energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the RIS element scheduling and beamforming coefficients, as well as the power allocation coefficients, subject to the user's individual rate requirement and the maximum RIS amplification power constraint. Using the Dinkelbach relaxation, the original mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is transformed into a nonfractional optimization problem with a two-layer structure, which is solved by the alternating optimization approach. In particular, an exhaustive search method is proposed to determine the optimal operating mode for each RIS element. Then, the RIS beamforming and power allocation coefficients are properly designed in an alternating manner. To overcome the potentially high complexity caused by exhaustive searching, we further develop a joint RIS element mode and beamforming optimization scheme by exploiting the Big-M formulation technique. Numerical results validate that: 1) The proposed hybrid RIS scheme yields higher EE than the baseline multi-antenna schemes employing fully active/passive RIS or conventional radio frequency chains; 2) Both proposed algorithms are effective in improving the system performance, especially the latter can achieve precise design of RIS elements with low complexity; and 3) For a fixed-size hybrid RIS, maximum EE can be reaped by setting only a minority of elements to operate in the active mode.</description>

      <title>OTFS vs OFDM: Which is Superior in Multiuser LEO Satellite Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, a delay-Doppler (DD) domain communication scheme exhibiting strong robustness against the Doppler shifts, has the potentials to be employed in LEO satellite communications. However, the performance comparison with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and the resource allocation scheme for multiuser OTFS-based LEO satellite communication system have rarely been investigated. In this paper, we conduct a performance comparison under various channel conditions between the OTFS and OFDM modulations, encompassing evaluations of sum-rate and bit error ratio (BER). Additionally, we investigate the joint optimal allocation of power and delay-Doppler resource blocks aiming at maximizing sum-rate for multiuser downlink OTFS-based LEO satellite communication systems. Unlike the conventional modulations relaying on complex input-output relations within the Time-Frequency (TF) domain, the OTFS modulation exploits both time and frequency diversities, i.e., delay and Doppler shifts remain constant during a OTFS frame, which facilitates a DD domain input-output simple relation for our investigation. We transform the resulting non-convex and combinatorial optimization problem into an equivalent difference of convex problem by decoupling the conditional constraints, and solve the transformed problem via penalty convex-concave procedure algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the OTFS modulation is robust to carrier frequency offsets (CFO) caused by high-mobility of LEO satellites, and has superior performance to the OFDM modulation. Moreover, numerical results indicate that our proposed resource allocation scheme has higher sum-rate than existed schemes for the OTFS modulation, such as delay divided multiple access and Doppler divided multiple access, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN) and a comparable classical Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for detection and classification problem using a radar. Specifically, we take a fairly complex radar time-series model derived from electromagnetic theory, namely the Martin-Mulgrew model, that is used to simulate radar returns of objects with rotating blades, such as drones. We find that when that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, CNN outperforms the HQNN for detection and classification. However, in the low SNR regime (which is of greatest interest in practice) the performance of HQNN is found to be superior to that of the CNN of a similar architecture.</description>

To achieve accurate sensing and reliable communication, large-scale arrays are anticipated to be implemented in such systems, which brings out the prominent issues on hardware cost and power consumption. To address these issues, hybrid beamforming (HBF), beyond its successful deployment in communication-only systems, could be a promising approach in the emerging DFRC ones. In this article, we investigate the development of the HBF techniques on the DFRC system in a self-contained manner. Specifically, we first introduce the basics of the HBF based DFRC system, where the system model and different receive modes are discussed with focus. Then we illustrate the corresponding design principles, which span from the performance metrics and optimization formulations to the design approaches and our preliminary results. Finally, potential extension and key research opportunities, such as the combination with the reconfigurable intelligent surface, are discussed concisely.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Neural Network with Knowledge Distillation for CSI Feedback</title>

Abstract: Deep learning has shown promise in enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback. However, many studies indicate that better feedback performance often accompanies higher computational complexity. Pursuing better performance-complexity tradeoffs is crucial to facilitate practical deployment, especially on computation-limited devices, which may have to use lightweight autoencoder with unfavorable performance. To achieve this goal, this paper introduces knowledge distillation (KD) to achieve better tradeoffs, where knowledge from a complicated teacher autoencoder is transferred to a lightweight student autoencoder for performance improvement. Specifically, two methods are proposed for implementation. Firstly, an autoencoder KD-based method is introduced by training a student autoencoder to mimic the reconstructed CSI of a pretrained teacher autoencoder. Secondly, an encoder KD-based method is proposed to reduce training overhead by performing KD only on the student encoder. Additionally, a variant of encoder KD is introduced to protect user equipment and base station vendor intellectual property. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly improve the student autoencoder's performance, while reducing the number of floating point operations and inference time to 3.05%-5.28% and 13.80%-14.76% of the teacher network, respectively. Furthermore, the variant encoder KD method effectively enhances the student autoencoder's generalization capability across different scenarios, environments, and bandwidths.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Function Radar-Communication System Empowered by Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the use of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems to improve communication capacity and sensing precision, and enhance coverage for both functions. In contrast to most of the existing RIS aided DFRC works where the RIS is modeled as a diagonal phase shift matrix and can only reflect signals to half space, we propose a novel beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) aided DFRC system. Specifically, the proposed BD-RIS supports the hybrid reflecting and transmitting mode, and is compatible with flexible architectures, enabling the system to realize full-space coverage and to achieve enhanced performance. To achieve the expected benefits, we jointly optimize the transmit waveform, the BD-RIS matrices, and sensing receive filters, by maximizing the minimum signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio for fair target detection, subject to the constraints of the communication quality of service, different BD-RIS architectures and power budget. To solve the non-convex and non-smooth max-min problem, a general solution based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is provided. Numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and show the superiority of the BD-RIS aided DFRC system in terms of both communication and sensing compared to conventional RIS aided DFRC.</description>

      <title>Approximately optimal domain adaptation with Fisher's Linear Discriminant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a class of models based on Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) in the context of domain adaptation. The class is the convex combination of two hypotheses: i) an average hypothesis representing previously seen source tasks and ii) a hypothesis trained on a new target task. For a particular generative setting we derive the optimal convex combination of the two models under 0-1 loss, propose a computable approximation, and study the effect of various parameter settings on the relative risks between the optimal hypothesis, hypothesis i), and hypothesis ii). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal classifier in the context of EEG- and ECG-based classification settings and argue that the optimal classifier can be computed without access to direct information from any of the individual source tasks. We conclude by discussing further applications, limitations, and possible future directions.</description>

      <title>Real-time Seismic Intensity Prediction using Self-supervised Contrastive GNN for Earthquake Early Warning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic intensity prediction from early or initial seismic waves received by a few seismic stations can enhance Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems, particularly in ground motion-based approaches like PLUM. While many operational EEW systems currently utilize point-source-based models that estimate the warning area based on magnitude and distance measures, direct intensity prediction offers a potential improvement in accuracy and reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach, Seismic Contrastive Graph Neural Network (SC-GNN), for highly accurate seismic intensity prediction using a small portion of initial seismic waveforms from a few seismic stations. The SC-GNN consists of two key components: (i) a graph neural network (GNN) to propagate spatiotemporal information through a graph-like structure representing seismic station distribution and wave propagation, and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive learning component to train the network with larger time windows and enable predictions using shorter initial waveforms. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on three real-world seismic datasets, where it shows superior performance over existing techniques, including a significant reduction in mean squared error (MSE) and the lowest standard deviation of error, indicating its robustness, reliability, and strong positive relationship between predicted and actual values. Notably, the SC-GNN model maintains superior performance even with 5s input waveforms, making it especially suitable for enhancing EEW applications.</description>

      <title>Power Transfer between Two Antenna Arrays in the Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16446v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical results with a focus on power transfer between two standard linear antenna arrays placed in the near field, where a much smaller active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) space feeds a far larger passive array referred to as a reflective intelligent surface (RIS). The interest is in the regime of focal length to diameter ($F/D$) ratio less than unity. We address the question of center feed vs. end feed for array-fed array antenna architectures and present the following novel findings and contributions: 1. In the regime of $F/D$ ratio less than one, AMAF-RIS power transfer deviates from the classical inverse square law. Furthermore, the behavior of the power transmission coefficient is more sensitive to the $F/D$ ratio than to a particular RIS size. 2. For an end-feed, non-eigenmodes provide better beam shapes than the eigenmodes, which are still inferior to beam shapes from the center-feed eigenmodes. 3. The center feed provides several dB more power gain than an end feed. This clearly illustrates that the center feed configuration should be used for array fed arrays, in contrast to the classical parabolic geometry.</description>

      <title>A New Heterogeneous Hybrid Massive MIMO Receiver with An Intrinsic Ability of Removing Phase Ambiguity of DOA Estimation via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) based fully-digital receive antenna arrays eventuate a huge amount of circuit costs and complexity to direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, which is hard to satisfy the needs of high precision and low cost in future green wireless communication. Hybrid analog and digital has lower cost but is subjected to the phase ambiguity. To address this challenge, a novel heterogeneous hybrid MIMO receiver is proposed in this paper and three high performance DOA estimators are developed based on the structure. Furthermore, two machine learning based methods are proposed to decrease computational complexity. The antenna arrays are first divided into multiple groups, and each group adopts a different hybrid structure. The virtual antenna arrays of these groups are then used for DOA estimation to generate multiple candidate angle sets, where each set contains a unique true solution and multiple pseudo-solutions. Finally, the cross-distance minimization method is applied to the multiple candidate angle sets to select the corresponding true solution for each group, and the final DOA estimation is given by combining the multiple true solutions. In addition, the corresponding closed-form expression of CramerRao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Simulation results show that as the number of antennas tends to large-scale, the proposed method can rapidly find the true solution for each group and achieve the CRLB. The proposed structure has excellent estimation performance and satisfactory energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of onboard sensors for track geometry monitoring against conventional track recording measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to assess the estimation of track condition parameters using onboard micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) accelerometers. A prototype of an onboard data acquisition system was designed and installed on a track recording car (TRC) and a measurement campaign was conducted on an extensive portion of the Brisbane Suburban railway network. Comparison of the accelerometer-based results vs TRC recordings have shown that accelerometers installed on the bogie are the best compromise between proximity to the source and insensitivity to impulsive noise. It was found that two vertical bogie accelerometers (left and right) provide a good quantitative estimate of vertical alignment and that strong correlations with TRC measurements exist for lateral MEMS accelerometer measurements (horizontal alignment). These findings suggest that two bogie MEMS accelerometers with vertical and lateral measurement axes are effective in estimating geographical distributions of vertical/horizontal alignment.</description>

      <title>D-Band 2D MIMO FMCW Radar System Design for Indoor Wireless Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present system design of D-band multi-input multi-output (MIMO) frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar for indoor wireless sensing. A uniform rectangular array (URA) of radar elements is used for 2D direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The DOA estimation accuracy of the MIMO radar array in the presence of noise is evaluated using the multiple-signal classification (MUSIC) and the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) algorithms. We investigate different scaling scenarios for the radar receiver (RX) SNR and the transmitter (TX) output power with the target distance. The DOA estimation algorithm providing the highest accuracy and shortest simulation time is shown to depend on the size of the radar array. Specifically, for a 64-element array, the MUSIC achieves lower root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared to the MVDR across 1--10\,m indoor distances and 0--30\,dB SNR (e.g., $\rm 0.8^{\circ}$/$\rm 0.3^{\circ}$ versus $\rm 1.0^{\circ}$/$\rm 0.5^{\circ}$ at 10/20\,dB SNR and 5\,m distance) and 0.5x simulation time. For a 16-element array, the two algorithms provide comparable performance, while for a 4-element array, the MVDR outperforms the MUSIC by a large margin (e.g., $\rm 8.3^{\circ}$/$\rm 3.8^{\circ}$ versus $\rm 62.2^{\circ}$/$\rm 48.8^{\circ}$ at 10/20\,dB SNR and 5\,m distance) and 0.8x simulation time. Furthermore, the TX output power requirement of the radar array is investigated in free-space and through-wall wireless sensing scenarios, and is benchmarked by the state-of-the-art D-band on-chip radars.</description>

      <title>Boosting Spectral Efficiency with Data-Carrying Reference Signals on the Grassmann Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In wireless networks, frequent reference signal transmission for accurate channel reconstruction may reduce spectral efficiency. To address this issue, we consider to use a data-carrying reference signal (DC-RS) that can simultaneously estimate channel coefficients and transmit data symbols. Here, symbols on the Grassmann manifold are exploited to carry additional data and to assist in channel estimation. Unlike conventional studies, we analyze the channel estimation errors induced by DC-RS and propose an optimization method that improves the channel estimation accuracy without performance penalty. Then, we derive the achievable rate of noncoherent Grassmann constellation assuming discrete inputs in multi-antenna scenarios, as well as that of coherent signaling assuming channel estimation errors modeled by the Gauss-Markov uncertainty. These derivations enable performance evaluation when introducing DC-RS, and suggest excellent potential for boosting spectral efficiency, where interesting crossings with the non-data carrying RS occurred at intermediate signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Cooperation in Heterogeneous Nanosatellite Constellations Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming landscape of Earth Observation missions will defined by networked heterogeneous nanosatellite constellations required to meet strict mission requirements, such as revisit times and spatial resolution. However, scheduling satellite communications in these satellite networks through efficiently creating a global satellite Contact Plan (CP) is a complex task, with current solutions requiring ground-based coordination or being limited by onboard computational resources. The paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these challenges by modeling the constellations and CP as dynamic networks and employing graph-based techniques. The proposed method utilizes a state-of-the-art dynamic graph neural network to evaluate the performance of a given CP and update it using a heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing. The trained neural network can predict the network delay with a mean absolute error of 3.6 minutes. Simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully design a contact plan for large satellite networks, improving the delay by 29.1%, similar to a traditional approach, while performing the objective evaluations 20x faster.</description>

      <title>DSS-o-SAGE: Direction-Scan Sounding-Oriented SAGE Algorithm for Channel Parameter Estimation in mmWave and THz Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigation of millimeter (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) channels relies on channel measurements and estimation of multi-path component (MPC) parameters. As a common measurement technique in the mmWave and THz bands, direction-scan sounding (DSS) resolves angular information and increases the measurable distance. Through mechanical rotation, the DSS creates a virtual multi-antenna sounding system, which however incurs signal phase instability and large data sizes, which are not fully considered in existing estimation algorithms and thus make them ineffective. To tackle this research gap, in this paper, a DSS-oriented space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (DSS-o-SAGE) algorithm is proposed for channel parameter estimation in mmWave and THz bands. To appropriately capture the measured data in mmWave and THz DSS, the phase instability is modeled by the scanning-direction-dependent signal phases. Furthermore, based on the signal model, the DSS-o-SAGE algorithm is developed, which not only addresses the problems brought by phase instability, but also achieves ultra-low computational complexity by exploiting the narrow antenna beam property of DSS. Simulations in synthetic channels are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and explore the applicable region of the far-field approximation in DSS-o-SAGE. Last but not least, the proposed DSS-o-SAGE algorithm is applied in real measurements in an indoor corridor scenario at 300~GHz. Compared with results using the baseline noise-elimination method, the channel is characterized more correctly and reasonably based on the DSS-o-SAGE.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Simultaneous Multi-User Communication and Multi-Target Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for a mono-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the dual-functional base station (BS) simultaneously communicates with multiple users and detects multiple moving targets. We aim at optimizing the ISAC waveform to jointly maximize the max-min fairness (MMF) rate of the communication users and minimize the largest eigenvalue of the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for unbiased estimation. The CRB matrix considered in this work is general as it involves the estimation of angular direction, complex reflection coefficient, and Doppler frequency for multiple moving targets. Simulation results demonstrate that RSMA maintains a larger communication and sensing trade-off than conventional space-division multiple access (SDMA) and it is capable of detecting multiple targets with a high detection accuracy. The finding highlights the potential of RSMA as an effective and powerful strategy for interference management in the general multi-user multi-target ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>MATNet: Multi-Level Fusion Transformer-Based Model for Day-Ahead PV Generation Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of renewable generation is crucial to facilitate the integration of RES into the power system. Focusing on PV units, forecasting methods can be divided into two main categories: physics-based and data-based strategies, with AI-based models providing state-of-the-art performance. However, while these AI-based models can capture complex patterns and relationships in the data, they ignore the underlying physical prior knowledge of the phenomenon. Therefore, in this paper we propose MATNet, a novel self-attention transformer-based architecture for multivariate multi-step day-ahead PV power generation forecasting. It consists of a hybrid approach that combines the AI paradigm with the prior physical knowledge of PV power generation of physics-based methods. The model is fed with historical PV data and historical and forecast weather data through a multi-level joint fusion approach. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using the Ausgrid benchmark dataset with different regression performance metrics. The results show that our proposed architecture significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. These findings demonstrate the potential of MATNet in improving forecasting accuracy and suggest that it could be a promising solution to facilitate the integration of PV energy into the power grid.</description>

      <title>Improving Robustness via Tilted Exponential Layer: A Communication-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques for enhancing robustness of deep networks mostly rely on empirical risk minimization with suitable data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach motivated by communication theory, aimed at enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of a neural network layer via neural competition during learning and inference. In addition to standard empirical risk minimization, neurons compete to sparsely represent layer inputs by maximization of a tilted exponential (TEXP) objective function for the layer. TEXP learning can be interpreted as maximum likelihood estimation of matched filters under a Gaussian model for data noise. Inference in a TEXP layer is accomplished by replacing batch norm by a tilted softmax, which can be interpreted as computation of posterior probabilities for the competing signaling hypotheses represented by each neuron. After providing insights via simplified models, we show, by experimentation on standard image datasets, that TEXP learning and inference enhances robustness against noise and other common corruptions, without requiring data augmentation. Further cumulative gains in robustness against this array of distortions can be obtained by appropriately combining TEXP with data augmentation techniques. The code for all our experiments is available at https://github.com/bhagyapuranik/texp_for_robustness.</description>

      <title>Neuro-GPT: Towards A Foundation Model for EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03764</link>

Abstract: To handle the scarcity and heterogeneity of electroencephalography (EEG) data for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) tasks, and to harness the power of large publicly available data sets, we propose Neuro-GPT, a foundation model consisting of an EEG encoder and a GPT model. The foundation model is pre-trained on a large-scale data set using a self-supervised task that learns how to reconstruct masked EEG segments. We then fine-tune the model on a Motor Imagery Classification task to validate its performance in a low-data regime (9 subjects). Our experiments demonstrate that applying a foundation model can significantly improve classification performance compared to a model trained from scratch, which provides evidence for the generalizability of the foundation model and its ability to address challenges of data scarcity and heterogeneity in EEG. The code is publicly available at github.com/wenhui0206/NeuroGPT.</description>

      <title>A 5G DMRS-based Signal for Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered as the potential key technology of the future mobile communication systems. The signal design is fundamental for the ISAC system. The reference signals in mobile communication systems have good detection performance, which is worth further research. Existing studies applied the single reference signal to radar sensing. In this paper, a multiple reference signals collaborative sensing scheme is designed. Specifically, we jointly apply channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS), positioning reference signal (PRS) and demodulation reference signal (DMRS) in radar sensing, which improve the performance of radar sensing via obtaining continuous time-frequency resource mapping. Cr\'amer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the joint reference signal for distance and velocity estimation is derived. The impacts of carrier frequency and subcarrier spacing on the performance of distance and velocity estimation are revealed. The results of simulation experiments show that compared with the single reference signal sensing scheme, the multiple reference signals collaborative sensing scheme effectively improves the sensing accuracy. Moreover, because of the discontinuous OFDM symbols, the accuracy of velocity estimation could be further improved via compressed sensing (CS). This paper has verified that multiple reference signals, instead of single reference signal, have much more superior performance on radar sensing, which is a practical and efficient approach in designing ISAC signal.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Near-field Communications for 6G: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided near-field communications is investigated. First, the necessity of investigating RIS-aided near-field communications and the advantages brought about by the unique spherical-wave-based near-field propagation are discussed. Then, the family of patch-array-based RISs and metasurface-based RISs are introduced along with their respective near-field channel models. A pair of fundamental performance limits of RIS-aided near-field communications, namely their power scaling law and effective degrees-of-freedom, are analyzed for both patch-array-based and metasurface-based RISs, which reveals the potential performance gains that can be achieved. Furthermore, the associated near-field beam training and beamforming design issues are studied, where a two-stage hierarchical beam training approach and a low-complexity element-wise beamforming design are proposed for RIS-aided near-field communications. Finally, a suite of open research problems is highlighted for motivating future research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00283</link>

Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive study on the emerging near-space communications (NS-COM) within the context of space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN). Specifically, we firstly explore the recent technical developments of NS-COM, followed by the discussions about motivations behind integrating NS-COM into SAGSIN. To further demonstrate the necessity of NS-COM, a comparative analysis between the NS-COM network and other counterparts in SAGSIN is conducted, covering aspects of deployment, coverage, channel characteristics and unique problems of NS-COM network. Afterwards, the technical aspects of NS-COM, including channel modeling, random access, channel estimation, array-based beam management and joint network optimization, are examined in detail. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of NS-COM, such as structural expansion in SAGSIN communication, civil aviation communication, remote and urgent communication, weather monitoring and carbon neutrality. Finally, some promising research avenues are identified, including stratospheric satellite (StratoSat) -to-ground direct links for mobile terminals, reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and holographic MIMO, federated learning in NS-COM networks, maritime communication, electromagnetic spectrum sensing and adversarial game, integrated sensing and communications, StratoSat-based radar detection and imaging, NS-COM assisted enhanced global navigation system, NS-COM assisted intelligent unmanned system and free space optical (FSO) communication. Overall, this paper highlights that the NS-COM plays an indispensable role in the SAGSIN puzzle, providing substantial performance and coverage enhancement to the traditional SAGSIN architecture.</description>

      <title>The last Dance : Robust backdoor attack via diffusion models and bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05967</link>

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning generative models that are trained on the principle of learning forward and backward diffusion processes via the progressive addition of noise and denoising. In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</description>

      <title>NeRF Solves Undersampled MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel undersampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that leverages the concept of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). With radial undersampling, the corresponding imaging problem can be reformulated into an image modeling task from sparse-view rendered data; therefore, a high dimensional MR image is obtainable from undersampled k-space data by taking advantage of implicit neural representation. A multi-layer perceptron, which is designed to output an image intensity from a spatial coordinate, learns the MR physics-driven rendering relation between given measurement data and desired image. Effective undersampling strategies for high-quality neural representation are investigated. The proposed method serves two benefits: (i) The learning is based fully on single undersampled k-space data, not a bunch of measured data and target image sets. It can be used potentially for diagnostic MR imaging, such as fetal MRI, where data acquisition is relatively rare or limited against diversity of clinical images while undersampled reconstruction is highly demanded. (ii) A reconstructed MR image is a scan-specific representation highly adaptive to the given k-space measurement. Numerous experiments validate the feasibility and capability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Active Element Selection in RIS-aided Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter delves into the critical aspects of optimizing energy efficiency (EE) in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted massive MIMO (M-MIMO) wireless communication systems. We develop a comprehensive and unified theoretical framework to analyze the boundaries of EE within M-MIMO systems integrated with active RIS while adhering to practical constraints. Our research focuses on a formulated EE optimization problem aiming to maximize the EE for active RIS-assisted M-MIMO communication systems. Our goal is to strategically find the number of active RIS elements for outperforming the EE attainable by an entirely passive RIS. Besides, the proposed novel solution has been tailored to the innovative problem. The formulation and solution design consider analytical optimization techniques, such as lagrangian dual transform (LDT) and fractional programming (FP) optimization, facilitating the effective implementation of RIS-aided M-MIMO applications in real-world settings. In particular, our results show that the proposed algorithm can provide up to 120% higher EE than the entirely passive RIS. Besides, we found that the active RIS can operate with less than half of the reflecting elements for the entirely passive RIS. Finally, in view of active RIS achieving the complete utilization of amplification power available, it should be equipped with a reasonable number of reflecting elements above N = 49.</description>

      <title>Identification of Craving Maps among Marijuana Users via Analysis of Functional Brain Networks with High-Order Attention Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The consumption of high doses of marijuana can have significant psychological and social impacts. In this study, we propose an interpretable novel framework called the HOGAB (High-Order Graph Attention Neural Networks) model for addictive Marijuana classification and analysis of the localized network clusters that demonstrated abnormal brain activities among chronic marijuana users. The HOGAB integrates dynamic intrinsic functional networks with LSTM technology to capture temporal patterns in fMRI time series of marijuana users. We employed the high-order attention module in neighborhood nodes for information fusion and message passing, enhancing community clustering analysis for long-term marijuana users. Furthermore, we improve the overall classification ability of the model by incorporating attention mechanisms, achieving an AUC of 85.1% and an accuracy of 80.7% in classification, higher than the comparison algoirthms. Specifically, we identified the most relevant subnetworks and cognitive regions that are influenced by persistent marijuana usage, revealing that chronic marijuana consumption adversely affects cognitive control, particularly within the Dorsal Attention and Frontoparietal networks, which are essential for attentional, cognitive and higher cognitive functions. The results show that our proposed model is capable of accurately predicting craving bahavior and identifying brain maps associated with long-term cravings, and thus pinpointing brain regions that are important for analysis.</description>
