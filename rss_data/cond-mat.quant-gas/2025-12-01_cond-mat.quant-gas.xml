      <title>Quantum phase transitions of the anisotropic Dicke-Ising model in driven Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of a generalized Dicke-Ising model realized with an array of Rydberg atoms, driven by microwave electric fields and coupled to an optical cavity. As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum-droplet necklace clusters in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of quasi-stable ring-shaped (necklace-shaped) clusters built, in the free space, of 3D quantum droplets (QDs) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, modeled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equations with the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. The QD clusters exhibit diverse dynamical behaviors, including contraction, oscillations, and expansion, depending on the cluster's initial radius. A phase shift between adjacent QDs imparts net angular momentum to the cluster, inducing its permanent rotation. Through the energy-minimization analysis, we predict equilibrium values of the necklace radius that support persistent rotation with negligible radial pulsations. In this regime, the clusters evolve as robust entities, maintaining the azimuthal symmetry in the course of the evolution, even in the presence of considerable perturbations. Necklace "supervortex" clusters, composed of QDs with inner vorticity 1 and global vorticity M, imprinted onto the cluster, may also persist for a long time. The reported findings may facilitate the experimental realization of complex self-sustained quantum states in the 3D free space.</description>

      <title>Probing the Fermi Sea Topology in a Quantum Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli's exclusion principle forces fermions to occupy distinct quantum states, creating a filled region of momentum space at low temperature, the Fermi sea, whose topology governs the system's response to perturbations and the nature of its correlation functions. Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological invariant that describes its shape -- is encoded in its ($D$+1)-point density correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic. Our results are in remarkable agreement with ideal-gas predictions, despite the presence of sizeable interactions, and establish a new pathway for probing many-body topology through correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic pumping of topological corner states by coherent tunneling in a 2D SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The active manipulation of topologically protected states represents a pivotal frontier for quantum technologies, offering a unique confluence of topological robustness and precise quantum control. We propose an adiabatic pumping scheme for the long-range transfer of topological corner states in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The protocol utilizes a modular lattice architecture composed of four topologically distinct subblocks, enabling the modulation of a topological dark state by precise tuning of lattice couplings. This approach is based on coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage among topological corner and interface states. We establish a multi-level model for the adiabatic pumping that provides an accurate description of the underlying mechanism. In comparison with a sequential two-stage Thouless pumping, our protocol offers superior performance in both transfer fidelity and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation in driven-dephasing Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry in superfluidity and superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the theoretical description of the role of quantum geometry in superfluidity and superconductivity of multiband systems, with focus on flat bands where quantum geometry is wholly responsible for supercurrents. This review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.</description>

      <title>Production and stabilization of a spin mixture of ultracold dipolar Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Numerical validation of an ultracold Hubbard quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of modulational instability and discrete breathers arising in a quasi-one-dimensional discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. Conditions for modulation instability and instability regions of nonlinear plane waves are determined in parameter space. We analytically investigate the existence of different quantum droplet solutions, including intersite, onsite, front-like, flat-top and dark localized modes, using the Page method and variational approach. Their stability is checked using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations. The analytical predictions corroborated with the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the system can exchange symmetry charge with the environment but still preserve symmetry at the ensemble level. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We illustrate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</description>
