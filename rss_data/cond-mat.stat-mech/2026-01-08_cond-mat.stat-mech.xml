      <title>Critical aging and relaxation dynamics in long-range systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical scaling of long-range $\mathrm{O}(N)$ models after a sudden quench to the critical temperature, using the functional renormalization group approach. We characterize both short-time aging and long-time relaxation as a function of the symmetry index $N$, the interaction range decay exponent $\sigma$ and the dimension $d$. Our results substantially improve on perturbative predictions, as demonstrated by benchmarks against Monte Carlo simulations and the large-$N$ limit. Finally, we demonstrate that long-range systems increase the performance of critical heat engines with respect to a local active medium.</description>

      <title>The Zubarev Double Time Greens function-A Vintage Many Body Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes present a comprehensive and powerful many-body technique pioneered in 1960 by D. N. Zubarev. The technique, known as the Zubarev Double Time Greens Function method, was used extensively by leading solid state physicists such as John Hubbard and Laura Roth in the 1960s. We present the technique and apply it to the non-interacting electron and boson gas. We next consider the (many-body) Hubbard model and show how it yields the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. It is easily extendable to superconductivity and related problems. Our treatment is pedagogical and understandable to those with just an elementary understanding of second quantization.</description>

      <title>Interplay of activity and non-reciprocity in tracer dynamics: From non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation to giant diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions play a key role in shaping transport in active and passive systems, giving rise to striking nonequilibrium behavior. Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, highlighting experimentally accessible signatures of non-reciprocal interactions in soft matter.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to the conjectured ordering between the waiting-time bound and the thermodynamic uncertainty bound on entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two widely used model-free lower bounds on the steady-state entropy production rate of a continuous-time Markov jump process are the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) bound $\sigma_\text{TUR}$, derived from the mean and variance of a current, and the waiting-time distribution (WTD) bound $\sigma_\mathcal{L}$, derived from the irreversibility of partially observed transition sequences together with their waiting times. It has been conjectured that $\sigma_{\mathcal L}$ is always at least as tight as $\sigma_{\mathrm{TUR}}$ when both are constructed from the same partially observed link. Here we provide four-state counterexamples in a nonequilibrium steady state where $\sigma_{\mathcal L}&lt;\sigma_{\mathrm{TUR}}$. This result shows that no universal ordering exists between these two inference bounds under partial observation.</description>

      <title>Random knotting in very long off-lattice self-avoiding polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results on knotting in off-lattice self-avoiding polygons in the bead-chain model. Using Clisby's tree data structure and the scale-free pivot algorithm, for each $k$ between $10$ and $27$ we generated $2^{43-k}$ polygons of size $n=2^k$. Using a new knot diagram simplification and invariant-free knot classification code, we were able to determine the precise knot type of each polygon. The results show that the number of prime summands of knot type $K$ in a random $n$-gon is very well described by a Poisson distribution. We estimate the characteristic length of knotting as $656500 \pm 2500$. We use the count of summands for large $n$ to measure knotting rates and amplitude ratios of knot probabilities more accurately than previous experiments. Our calculations agree quite well with previous on-lattice computations, and support both knot localization and the knot entropy conjecture.</description>

      <title>Universality in driven systems with a multiply-degenerate umbilic point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a driven particle system, a multilane asymmetric exclusion process, where the particle number in every lane is conserved, and stationary state is fully uncorrelated. The phase space has, starting from three lanes and more, an umbilic manifold where characteristic velocities of all the modes but one coincide, thus allowing us to study a weakly hyperbolic system with arbitrarily large degeneracy. We then study space-time fluctuations in the steady state, at the umbilic manifold, which are expected to exhibit universal scaling features. We formulate an effective mode-coupling theory (MCT) for the multilane model within the umbilic subspace and test its predictions. Unlike in the bidirectional two-lane model with an umbilic point studied earlier, here we find a robust $z=3/2$ dynamical exponent for the umbilic mode. The umbilic scaling function, obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations, for the simplest 3-lane scenario, appears to have an universal shape for a range of interaction parameters. Remarkably, the shape and dynamic exponent of the non-degenerate mode can be analytically predicted on the base of effective MCT, up to non-universal scaling factor. Our findings suggest the existence of novel universality classes with dynamical exponent $3/2$, appearing in long-lived hydrodynamic modes with equal characteristic velocities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path Compression for Spectral Tensor Networks on Cyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to compress cyclic tensor networks called stochastic path compression (SPC) that uses an iterative importance sampling procedure to target edges with large bond-dimensions. Closed random walks in SPC form compression pathways that spatially localize large bond-dimensions in the tensor network. Analogous to the phase separation of two immiscible liquids, SPC separates the graph of bond-dimensions into spatially distinct high and low density regions. When combined with our integral decimation algorithm, SPC facilitates the accurate compression of cyclic tensor networks with continuous degrees of freedom. To benchmark and illustrate the methods, we compute the absolute thermodynamics of $q$-state clock models on two-dimensional square lattices and an XY model on a Watts-Strogatz graph, which is a small-world network with random connectivity between spins.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Static Kuhn Length: Conformational Substructures and Relaxation Dynamics in Flexible Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical "monomer-based" segment length $b$ and the Kuhn length $l_k$ are central to polymer physics, yet the minimal size required for a truly statistical segment - Gaussian, uncorrelated, and valid as an entropic spring - is not rigorously established. Using atomistic simulations of entangled polyethylene, we re-evaluate these foundational quantities.
  By fitting end-to-end distance distributions of C--C bond blocks and validating with higher-moment analyses, we identify for the first time the minimal sizes corresponding to a statistical segment and an entropic spring. A single Kuhn segment (approximately 11 bonds) is the smallest statistically uncorrelated unit, but its distance distribution is strongly non-Gaussian, while the monomer-based segment $b$, used in rheology and classical tube-theory formulations, is not statistical at all. True Gaussianity emerges only for blocks containing multiple Kuhn segments.
  At the Kuhn scale, we uncover a previously unresolved conformational heterogeneity. Each segment samples a broad range of conformations, from coiled (approximately 4~\AA) to extended (approximately 14~\AA), giving rise to three distinct substructures: aligned chain segments (ACS), random conformational sequences (RCS), and chain ends (CE). These exhibit distinct dynamical signatures. ACS relax with a stretched-exponential exponent $\beta \approx 0.5$, consistent with quasi-one-dimensional, defect-mediated localized modes, whereas RCS and CE relax with $\beta \approx 0.7$. By connecting these results to localized-mode theory and continuous-time random-walk models, we provide a molecular interpretation of stretched-exponential relaxation in polymer melts.</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part II -- Network-level mechanisms and emergent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the phenomenological and microscopic models reviewed in Part I, this second part focuses on network-level mechanisms that generate emergent temperature response curves. We review deterministic models in which temperature modulates the kinetics of coupled biochemical reactions, as well as stochastic frameworks, such as Markov chains, that capture more complex multi-step processes. These approaches show how Arrhenius-like temperature dependence at the level of individual reactions is transformed into non-Arrhenius scaling, thermal limits, and temperature compensation at the system level. Together, network-level models provide a mechanistic bridge between empirical temperature response curves and the molecular organization of biological systems, giving us predictive insights into robustness, perturbations, and evolutionary constraints.</description>

      <title>Explosivity in 1-d Activated Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Activated Random Walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ is explosive above criticality. That is, activating a single particle in a supercritical state of sleeping particles triggers an infinite avalanche of activity with positive probability. This extends the same result recently proven by Brown, Hoffman, and Son for i.i.d. initial distributions to the setting of ergodic ones, thus completing the proof of a conjecture of Rolla's in dimension one. As a corollary we obtain that, for supercritical ergodic initial distributions with any positive density of particles initially active, the system will stay active almost surely. Our result is another piece of evidence attesting to the universality of the phase transition of Activated Random Walk on $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Polymorph Selection in Charged Colloids in the Second Nucleation Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study polymorph selection in a model of charged colloids, with a focus on the higher-order structure prior to and during nucleation. Specifically, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations of a repulsive Yukawa system with a slightly softened (Weeks-Chandler-Andersen) core. We consider the case where the interaction is long-ranged and the BCC crystal is stable, and also intermediate- and short-ranged cases where the FCC crystal is stable. We use two methods for structure identification, the topological cluster classification (TCC) [A. Malins et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234506 (2013)] and the bond orientational order parameter analysis of W. Lechner and C. Dellago [J. Chem. Phys.129, 114707 (2008)]. Under conditions of high supersaturation, appropriate to experiments with colloids, we find that the system forms a precursor state in which the particles are hexagonally ordered. ~That is to say, the precursors are indistinguishable from an HCP crystal using the bond orientational order parameters. This ordering occurs at state points both when the body-centred cubic crystal is the stable phase, and also when the face-centred cubic crystal is stable. In all cases, the stable polymorph forms from the precursor phase in a second stage. Although at freezing, the fluid is very much more ordered when the interactions are short-ranged (when FCC is stable), at the supersaturations where nucleation occurs in our simulations, the higher-order structure of the metastable fluids is almost identical for the long-, short-, and intermediate-ranged systems when measured with the TCC.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials under uniform shear flow: comparison with simplified model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a kinetic-theory framework to investigate the steady rheology of a dilute gas interacting via a repulsive potential under uniform shear flow. Starting from the Boltzmann equation with a restitution coefficient that depends on the impact velocity and potential strength, we derive evolution equations for the stress tensor based on Grad's moment expansion. The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and steady viscosity. We also analyze the velocity distribution functions, revealing that the system remains nearly Maxwellian even under strong shear.</description>

      <title>Koopman Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects are conventionally manifested as boundary localization of eigenstates in linear systems. In nonlinear settings, however, where eigenstates are no longer well defined, it becomes unclear how skin effects should be faithfully characterized. Here, we propose a Koopman-based characterization of nonlinear skin effects, in which localization is defined in terms of Koopman eigenfunctions in a lifted observable space, rather than physical states. Using a minimal nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model, we show that dominant Koopman eigenfunctions localize sharply on higher-order observables, in stark contrast to linear skin effects confined to linear observables. This lifted-space localization governs the sensitivity to boundary amplitude perturbations, providing a distinct dynamical signature of the nonlinear skin effect. Our results establish the Koopman framework as a natural setting in which skin effects unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems can be identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate double-interval entanglement measures, specifically reflected entropy, mutual information, and logarithmic negativity, in quasiparticle excited states for classical, bosonic, and fermionic systems. We develop an algorithm that efficiently calculates these measures from density matrices expressed in a non-orthonormal basis, enabling straightforward numerical implementation. We find a universal additivity property that emerges at large momentum differences, where the entanglement measures for states with distinct quasiparticle sets equal the sum of their individual contributions. The classical limit arises as a special case of this additivity, with both bosonic and fermionic results converging to classical behavior when all momentum differences are large.</description>

      <title>Interference-Induced Suppression of Doublon Transport and Prethermalization in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherent mobility of doublons, arising from second-order virtual dissociation-recombination processes, fundamentally limits their use as information carriers in the strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in a model of confined granular mixtures at moderate densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work derives the Navier--Stokes hydrodynamic equations for a model of a confined, quasi-two-dimensional, $s$-component mixture of inelastic, smooth, hard spheres. Using the inelastic version of the revised Enskog theory, macroscopic balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are obtained, and constitutive equations for the fluxes are determined through a first-order Chapman--Enskog expansion. As for elastic collisions, the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations. Approximate solutions to these equations for diffusion transport coefficients and shear viscosity are achieved by assuming steady-state conditions and considering leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. These transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses and diameters of the mixture's components, and the system's density. The results apply to moderate densities and are not limited to particular values of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, mass, and/or diameter ratios. As an application, the thermal diffusion factor is evaluated to analyze segregation driven by temperature gradients and gravity, providing criteria that distinguish whether larger particles accumulate near the hotter or colder boundaries.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Line Energy of a Topological Phase</title>

Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the interface energy. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum correction to the interfacial line energy. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear thermodynamic computing out of equilibrium</title>

Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</description>

      <title>Tensor Renormalization-Group study of the surface critical behavior of a frustrated two-layer Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two replicas of a 2D Ising model are coupled by frustrated spin-spin interactions. It is known that this inter-layer coupling is marginal and that the bulk critical behavior belongs to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) universality class, as the $J_1-J_2$ Ising model. In this work, the surface critical behavior is studied numerically by Tensor Renormalization-Group calculations. The Bond-Weight Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm is extended to tackle systems with boundaries. It is observed that the two-fold degeneracy of the surface magnetic scaling dimension of the AT model is lifted in the frustrated two-layer Ising model (F2LIM). The splitting is explained by the breaking of the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-symmetry under spin reversal of a single Ising replica in the F2LIM. The two distinct surface magnetic scaling dimensions $x_1^s$ and $x_2^s$ of the F2LIM satisfies a simple duality relation $x_1^s=1/4x_2^s$.</description>

      <title>Inference in conditioned dynamics through causality restoration</title>

Abstract: Computing observables from conditioned dynamics is typically computationally hard, because, although obtaining independent samples efficiently from the unconditioned dynamics is usually feasible, generally most of the samples must be discarded (in a form of importance sampling) because they do not satisfy the imposed conditions. Sampling directly from the conditioned distribution is non-trivial, as conditioning breaks the causal properties of the dynamics which ultimately renders the sampling procedure efficient. One standard way of achieving it is through a Metropolis Monte-Carlo procedure, but this procedure is normally slow and a very large number of Monte-Carlo steps is needed to obtain a small number of statistically independent samples. In this work, we propose an alternative method to produce independent samples from a conditioned distribution. The method learns the parameters of a generalized dynamical model that optimally describe the conditioned distribution in a variational sense. The outcome is an effective, unconditioned, dynamical model, from which one can trivially obtain independent samples, effectively restoring causality of the conditioned distribution. The consequences are twofold: on the one hand, it allows us to efficiently compute observables from the conditioned dynamics by simply averaging over independent samples. On the other hand, the method gives an effective unconditioned distribution which is easier to interpret. The method is flexible and can be applied virtually to any dynamics. We discuss an important application of the method, namely the problem of epidemic risk assessment from (imperfect) clinical tests, for a large family of time-continuous epidemic models endowed with a Gillespie-like sampler. We show that the method compares favorably against the state of the art, including the soft-margin approach and mean-field methods.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Active Crystals and Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensions (2D), the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) fluctuation plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects marked by long-range density fluctuations leading to the singularities of various dynamical properties. According to the MWH theorem, a 2D equilibrium system with continuous degrees of freedom cannot achieve long-range crystalline order at non-zero temperatures. Recently, MWH fluctuations have been observed in glass-forming liquids, evidenced by the logarithmic divergence in the plateau value of mean squared displacement (MSD). Our research investigates long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline and glassy systems influenced by non-equilibrium active noises. Active systems serve as a minimal model for understanding diverse non-equilibrium dynamics, such as those in biological systems and self-propelled colloids. We demonstrate that fluctuations from active forces can strongly couple with long-wavelength density fluctuations, altering the lower critical dimension ($d_l$) from $2$ to $3$ and leading to a novel logarithmic divergence of the MSD plateau with system size in 3D.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we call reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha&gt;D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Koteck\'y and Preiss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a mesoscopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and a model with continuous O(3) symmetry, and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, spontaneous symmetry breaking and previously unidentified universality classes is evident. The framework introduced here holds particular relevance for monolayer spintronics research, where the ultimate goal is to achieve a strong ferromagnetic order at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum information-cost relations and fluctuations beyond thermal environments: A thermodynamic inference approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>

Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix associated to the stochastic wave function.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics and energy-gap scaling in $k-$local spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins, whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For $\mu = 0$, we demonstrate that the random matrix ensemble -- Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), or Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) -- is determined by the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, following standard time-reversal symmetry classification. For couplings with a nonzero mean, we map the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions for an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. For $\mu &lt; 0$, we find two distinct regimes: for $k \gg \sqrt{L}$, the gap closes at critical disorder $\sigma_{c} \approx |\mu|$. Near this transition the energy gap $\Delta$ exhibits universal quadratic scaling $\Delta /L \sim (\sigma - \sigma_{c})^{2}$. When $k \ll \sqrt{L}$, $\sigma_{c}$ scales with $|\mu|$, but lacks a sharp transition. Our work introduces a semi-solvable model that captures universal features of random-matrix statistics, and spectral gap formation, providing a foundation for systematic extensions to more general many-body systems.</description>
