      <title>Semi-strictification of $(\infty, n)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the first equivalence between a weak non-algebraic model and a semi-strict algebraic model of $(\infty, n)$-categories. This takes the form of a natural semi-strictification, whereby a weak $(\infty, n)$-category is embedded into a semi-strict one through an acyclic cofibration, in such a way that weak functors lift to semi-strict functors; this constitutes the derived unit of a Quillen equivalence between weak model categories whose fibrant objects are, respectively, the weak $(\infty, n)$-categories and (up to an acyclic fibration) the semi-strict ones. The semi-strict model has algebraic units and composition of round pasting diagrams, satisfying a strict form of associativity and interchange as in Henry's regular version of Simpson's weak units conjecture; semi-strict functors strictly preserve round composition, but only weakly preserve units. Globular composition operations are obtained from a combination of units and round composition. Since the models satisfy the homotopy hypothesis in the case $n = 0$, this result also exhibits the first semi-strict model of the classical homotopy types that has algebraic units and composition. The constructions are based on the combinatorics of regular directed complexes and are entirely explicit and combinatorial, in the spirit of Mac Lane's strictification of bicategories.</description>

      <title>The concept of nullity in general spaces and contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of nullity is present in all discourses of mathematics. The two most familiar notions of nullity are "almost-every" and "almost none". A notion of nullity corresponds to a choice of subsets that one interprets as null or non-empty. The rationale behind this choice depends on the context, such as Topology or Measure theory. One also expects that the morphisms or transformations within the contexts preserve the nullity structures. Extending this idea, a generalized notion of nullity is presented as a functor between categories. A constructive procedure is presented for extending the notion of nullity to categories with richer structure. Thus nullity in a category, such as that of general vector spaces, can be provided a recursive definition. Thus nullity is an arbitrary construct, which can be extended to broader contexts using well defined rules. These rules are succinctly expressed by right and left Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>Algebraic $K$-theory of coherent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a description of the value of a finitary localizing invariant, such as algebraic $K$-theory, on the category of sheaves on a locally coherent space $X$. This in particular includes all spaces that arise as spectra of commutative rings. As applications we discuss the connection between scissors congruence $K$-theory and Topological Hochschild Homology of certain locally coherent spaces, as well as the algebraic $K$-theory of a measure space.</description>

      <title>Tables of practical invariants for distinguishing multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses to what extent the census of multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7, proposed by the software package Anyonica and the anyonwiki website, can be regarded as a proper classification. The questions of correctness and completeness are briefly discussed, and the question of inequivalence of the provided categories is resolved under the assumption that all proposed data is correct. This is done by providing tables of small sets of invariants for these categories, for which (a) their invariance under automorphisms can be checked manually, and (b) the (in)equivalence of two skeletal fusion categories can be checked manually. These invariants can also be used to identify the category on the anyonwiki that corresponds to one for which the skeletal data is known.</description>

      <title>Deformations of objects in $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the deformation theory of an object in an $n$-category is controlled by the its $n$-fold endomorphism algebra. This recovers Lurie's results on deforming objects and categories. We also generalize a previous result by Blanc et al. on deforming a category and an object simultaneously to the case of $n$-categories.</description>

      <title>Quantifying analogy of concepts via ologs and wiring diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build on the theory of ontology logs (ologs) created by Spivak and Kent, and define a notion of wiring diagrams. In this article, a wiring diagram is a finite directed labelled graph. The labels correspond to types in an olog; they can also be interpreted as readings of sensors in an autonomous system. As such, wiring diagrams can be used as a framework for an autonomous system to form abstract concepts. We show that the graphs underlying skeleton wiring diagrams form a category. This allows skeleton wiring diagrams to be compared and manipulated using techniques from both graph theory and category theory. We also extend the usual definition of graph edit distance to the case of wiring diagrams by using operations only available to wiring diagrams, leading to a metric on the set of all skeleton wiring diagrams. In the end, we give an extended example on calculating the distance between two concepts represented by wiring diagrams, and explain how to apply our framework to any application domain.</description>

      <title>Delooping presented groups in homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homotopy type theory is a logical setting based on Martin-L\"of type theory in which one can perform geometric constructions and proofs in a synthetic way. Namely, types can be interpreted as spaces up to homotopy and proofs as homotopy invariant constructions. In this context, loop spaces of pointed connected groupoids provide a natural representation of groups, and any group can be obtained as the loop space of such a type, which is then called a delooping of the group. There are two main methods for constructing the delooping of an arbitrary group G. The first one consists in describing it as a pointed higher inductive type, whereas the second one consists in taking the connected component of the principal G-torsor in the type of sets equipped with an action of G. We show here that, when a presentation (or even a generating set) is known for the group, simpler variants of those constructions can be used to build deloopings. The resulting types are more amenable to computations and lead to simpler meta-theoretic reasoning. Finally, we develop a type theoretical notion of 2-polygraph, which allows manipulating higher inductive types such as the ones involved in the description of deloopings. These allow us to investigate in this context a construction for the Cayley graph of a generated group and show that it encodes the relations of the group, as well as a Cayley complex which encodes relations between relations. Many of the developments performed in the article have been formalized using the cubical version of the Agda proof assistant.</description>
