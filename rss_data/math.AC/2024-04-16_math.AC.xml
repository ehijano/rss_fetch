      <title>Some algebras with trivial rings of differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an arbitrary field. We construct examples of regular local $k$-algebras $R$ (of positive dimension) for which the ring of differential operators $D_k(R)$ is trivial in the sense that it contains {\it no} operators of positive order. The examples are excellent in characteristic zero but not in positive characteristic. These rings can be viewed as being non-singular but they are not simple as $D$-modules, laying to rest speculation that $D$-simplicity might characterize a nice class of singularities in general. In prime characteristic, the construction also provides examples of {\it regular} local rings $R$ (with fraction field a function field) whose Frobenius push-forward $F_*^eR$ is {\it indecomposable} as an $R$-module for all $e\in \mathbb N$. Along the way, we investigate hypotheses on a local ring $(R, m)$ under which $D$-simplicity for $R$ is equivalent to $D$-simplicity for its $m$-adic completion, and give examples of rings for which the differential operators do not behave well under completion. We also generalize a characterization of $D$-simplicity due to Jeffries in the $\mathbb N$-graded case: for a Noetherian local $k$-algebra $(R, m, k)$, $D$-simplicity of $R$ is equivalent to surjectivity of the natural map $D_k(R)\to D_k(R, k)$.</description>

      <title>$q$-Krull dimension of commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the $q$-Krull dimension of a commutative ring via its $q$-operation. A new characterization of $\tau_q$-von Neumann regular rings is obtained, and some properties of rings $q$-Krull dimension 0 are studied. Moreover, we characterize the $q$-Krull dimension of $\tau_q$-Noetherian rings in terms of Krull dimension of some total quotient rings. Besides, we show that every ring with $w$-Krull dimension $0$ is a \DW\ ring, positively answers an question proposed by H. Kim.</description>

      <title>Numerical semigroups via projections and via quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine two natural operations to create numerical semigroups. We say that a numerical semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ is $k$-normalescent if it is the projection of the set of integer points in a $k$-dimensional polyhedral cone, and we say that $\mathcal{S}$ is a $k$-quotient if it is the quotient of a numerical semigroup with $k$ generators. We prove that all $k$-quotients are $k$-normalescent, and although the converse is false in general, we prove that the projection of the set of integer points in a cone with $k$ extreme rays (possibly lying in a dimension smaller than $k$) is a $k$-quotient. The discrete geometric perspective of studying cones is useful for studying $k$-quotients: in particular, we use it to prove that the sum of a $k_1$-quotient and a $k_2$-quotient is a $(k_1+k_2)$-quotient. In addition, we prove several results about when a numerical semigroup is not $k$-normalescent.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the Minimum Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \({\mathbb K}\) be any field, let \(X\subset {\mathbb P}^{k-1}\) be a set of \(n\) distinct \({\mathbb K}\)-rational points, and let \(a\geq 1\) be an integer. In this paper we find lower bounds for the minimum distance \(d(X)_a\) of the evaluation code of order \(a\) associated to \(X\). The first results use \(\alpha(X)\), the initial degree of the defining ideal of \(X\), and the bounds are true for any set \(X\). In another result we use \(s(X)\), the minimum socle degree, to find a lower bound for the case when \(X\) is in general linear position. In both situations we improve and generalize known results.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the closed neighborhood ideal of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and let $NI(G)$ denote the closed neighborhood ideal of $G$ in a polynomial ring $R$. We show that if $G$ is a forest, then the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $R/NI(G)$ is the same as the matching number of $G$, thus proving a conjecture of Sharifan and Moradi in the affirmative. We also show that the matching number of $G$ provides a lower bound for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $R/NI(G)$ when $G$ is a chordal graph, unicyclic graph, complete bipartite graph, or the wheel graph. For forests and unicyclic graphs, we show that the projective dimension of $R/NI(G)$ is also bounded below by the matching number of $G$. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between the regularity and the matching number for two graph operations, namely, the join and the corona product of two graphs.</description>

      <title>$v$-numbers of symbolic power filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09175v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of $v$-number and local $v$-numbers of Noetherian generalized symbolic power filtrations $\mathcal I=\{I_n\}$ in a Noetherian $\mathbb N$-graded domain and show that they are quasi-linear type. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of the limits $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{v(I_n)}{n}$ and $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{v_\mathfrak p(I_n)}{n}$ for all $\mathfrak p\in\overline A(\mathcal I)$. We explicitly compute local $v$-numbers and $v$-numbers of symbolic powers of cover ideals of complete bipartite graphs, complete graphs, cycles, $K_m^s$ and compare them with their Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. We give an example of a bipartite graph $\mathcal H$ that is not a complete bipartite graph and $v(J(\mathcal H))&gt;bight(I(\mathcal H))-1$. This answers a question in [25, Question 3.12]. We show that for both connected bipartite graphs and connected non-bipartite graphs, the difference between the regularity and the $v$-number of the cover ideals can be arbitrarily large. This strengthens and gives an alternative proof of[25,Theorem 3.10]. We provide a counterexample to a conjecture [12, Conjecture 5.4] due to A. Ficarra and E. Sgroi.</description>

      <title>Minimal Cellular Resolutions of Path Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the path ideals of both paths and cycles have minimal cellular resolutions. Specifically, these minimal free resolutions coincide with the Barile-Macchia resolutions for paths, and their generalized counterparts for cycles. Furthermore, we identify edge ideals of cycles as a class of ideals that lack a minimal Barile-Macchia resolution, yet have a minimal generalized Barile-Macchia resolution.</description>

      <title>Homological invariants of Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer codes with qudits of arbitrary, not necessarily uniform, dimensions. Using homological methods, we define a series of invariants called charge modules. We describe their properties and physical meaning. The most complete results are obtained for codes whose charge modules have Krull dimension zero. This condition is interpreted as mobility of excitations. We show that it is always satisfied for translation invariant 2D codes with unique ground state in infinite volume, which was previously known only in the case of uniform, prime qudit dimension. For codes all of whose excitations are mobile we construct a $p$-dimensional excitation and a $(D-p-1)$-form symmetry for every element of the $p$-th charge module. Moreover, we define a braiding pairing between charge modules in complementary degrees. We discuss examples which illustrate how charge modules and braiding can be computed in practice.</description>

      <title>Generic derivations on algebraically bounded structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let K be an algebraically bounded structure and T be its theory. If T is model complete, then the theory of K endowed with a derivation, denoted by $T^{\delta}$, has a model completion. Additionally, we prove that if the theory T is stable/NIP then the model completion of $T^{\delta}$ is also stable/NIP. Similar results hold for the theory with several derivations, either commuting or non-commuting.</description>
