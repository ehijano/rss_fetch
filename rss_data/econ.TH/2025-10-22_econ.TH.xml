      <title>Optimal allocations with distortion risk measures and mixed risk attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Pareto-optimal risk sharing in economies with heterogeneous attitudes toward risk, where agents' preferences are modeled by distortion risk measures. Building on comonotonic and counter-monotonic improvement results, we show that agents with similar attitudes optimally share risks comonotonically (risk-averse) or counter-monotonically (risk-seeking). We show how the general $n$-agent problem can be reduced to a two-agent formulation between representative risk-averse and risk-seeking agents, characterized by the infimal convolution of their distortion risk measures. Within this two-agent framework, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal allocations, and we identify when the infimal convolution yields an unbounded value. When existence fails, we analyze the problem under nonnegative allocation constraints, and we characterize optima explicitly, under piecewise-linear distortion functions and Bernoulli-type risks. Our findings suggest that the optimal allocation structure is governed by the relative strength of risk aversion versus risk seeking behavior, as intuition would suggest.</description>

      <title>Teacher transfers: equalizing deficits across schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act (2009) (RTE) of the Government of India prescribes student-teacher ratios for state-run schools. One method advocated by the Act to achieve its goals is the redeployment of teachers from surplus to deficit (in teacher strength) schools. We consider a model where teachers can either remain in their initially assigned schools or be transferred to a deficit school in their acceptable set. The planner's objective is specified in terms of the post-transfer deficit vector that can be achieved. We show that there exists a transfer whose post-transfer deficit vector Lorenz dominates all achievable post-transfer deficit vectors. We provide a two-stage algorithm to derive the Lorenz-dominant post-transfer deficit vector, and show that this algorithm is strategy-proof for teachers.</description>

      <title>Communication with Multiple Senders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a cheap talk model with one receiver and multiple senders. Each sender observes a noisy signal regarding the unknown state. Existing literature (e.g., Levit and Malenko, 2011; Battaglini, 2017) focuses on scenarios where the receiver and the senders have aligned preferences in each state. We further explore situations with disagreement states where the receiver and the senders have misaligned preferences. We first show that, when the number of senders grows large, each sender's message must convey almost no information to the receiver. Furthermore, we identify a discontinuity in information transmission: with moderate conflict between the receiver and the senders, introducing an arbitrarily small probability of disagreement states leads to complete unraveling, in contrast to complete information transmission predicted by the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that the receiver cannot fully learn the state even when receiving messages from arbitrarily many senders.</description>

      <title>On the hidden costs of passive investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive investing has gained immense popularity due to its low fees and the perceived simplicity of focusing on zero tracking error, rather than security selection. However, our analysis shows that the passive (zero tracking error) approach of waiting until the market close on the day of index reconstitution to purchase a stock (that was announced days earlier as an upcoming addition) results in costs amounting to hundreds of basis points compared to strategies that involve gradually acquiring a small portion of the required shares in advance with minimal additional tracking errors. In addition, we show that under all scenarios analyzed, a trader who builds a small inventory post-announcement and provides liquidity at the reconstitution event can consistently earn several hundreds of basis points in profit and often much more, assuming minimal risk.</description>
