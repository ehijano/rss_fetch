      <title>On low-dimensional uniform rectifiability in Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refining an earlier result due to Hahlomaa, we provide a new Carleson-type condition for $k$-regular sets in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ to have big pieces of Lipschitz images of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^k$ for $1\leq k\leq n$. Our approach passes via the corona decompositions by normed spaces, recently introduced by Bate, Hyde, and Schul. Along the way, we prove implications between several notions of quantitative rectifiability for low-dimensional sets in $\mathbb{H}^n$.</description>

      <title>Comparison and Rigidity Theorems for geodesic curvatures in two dimensional Alexandrov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study geodesic curvature of the boundary of a two dimensional Alexandrov space of curvature bounded below (CBB). We prove several comparison and globalization theorems for the geodesic curvature, generalizing the known results for curves in space of curvature bounded above (CBA) by Alexander and Bishop (Differ. Geom. Appl. 6, No. 1, 67-86 (1996)). We also prove a rigidity theorem for boundary with corners and geodesic curvature lower bound. This generalizes the known rigidity result by Grove and Peterson (Geom. Topol. 26 (4) 1635 - 1668, (2022)) in 2d.</description>

      <title>Holmes-Thompson area of inscribed polygons and convex projective structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive tuples of complete flags in $\mathbb{R}^3$ define two convex polygons in $\mathbb{RP}^2$, one inscribed in the other. We are interested in relating the Holmes-Thompson area of the inner polygon for the Hilbert metric on the outer polygon to the double and triple ratios of the positive tuple of flags. This article focuses on positive triples and quadruples of flags. For quadruples, we investigate the special cases of hyperbolic quadrilaterals and the parametrization of the finite area convex real projective structures on a thrice-punctured sphere.</description>

      <title>Morphisms of generalized affine buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of morphism for generalized affine buildings, also known as affine $\Lambda$-buildings, extending existing definitions and giving rise to a category of generalized affine buildings. For affine $\Lambda$-buildings equipped with a transitive group action, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of morphisms between them. As an application, we investigate under which conditions morphisms or isomorphisms between various generalized affine buildings from the literature (defined via lattices, norms, non-standard symmetric spaces, or \`a la Bruhat-Tits) can be defined. For generalized affine buildings coming from non-standard symmetric spaces we further show functoriality for subgroups and under change of valued field.</description>

      <title>Geometric rigidity of quasi-isometries in horospherical products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that quasi-isometries of horospherical products of hyperbolic spaces are geometrically rigid in the sense that they are uniformly close to product maps, this is a generalisation of the result obtained by Eskin, Fisher and Whyte in [7]. Our work covers the case of solvable Lie groups of the form R ___ (N 1 x N 2), where N 1 and N 2 are nilpotent Lie groups, and where the action on R contracts the metric on N 1 while extending it on N 2. We obtain new quasi-isometric invariants and classi cations for these spaces.</description>

      <title>Carath\'eodory distance-preserving maps between bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the rigidity of maps between bounded symmetric domains that preserve the Carath\'eodory/Kobayashi distance. We show that such maps are only possible when the rank of the co-domain is at least as great as that of the domain. When the ranks are equal, and the domain is irreducible, we prove that the map is either holomorphic or antiholomorphic. In the holomorphic case, we show that the map is in fact a triple homomorphism, under the additional assumption that the origin is mapped to the origin. We exploit the large-scale geometry of the Carath\'eodory distance and use the horocompactification and Gromov product to obtain these results without requiring any smoothness assumptions on the maps.</description>

      <title>Regular triangle unions with maximal number of sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an integer n&gt;=1. Suppose, a simple polygon is a union of n triangles so that vertices along the common boundary are arranged cyclically. What is the maximal number of sides such union - call it regular - can have? This is a sequence A375986, a recent entry into the OEIS. In this paper we prove that the sequence starts as 3, 12, 22, 33, 45, 56, 67, 80, 91, and satisfies simple linear lower and upper bounds. The latter is not only a bound, but in fact is realizable combinatorially. The questions whether it can be realized in pseudoline geometry, and, if so, whether such constructions are stretchable, are the next natural ones to pose. The paper is mostly expository and written in an informal style. However, it adds a new tool in investigating unions of objects; namely, triangulation shifts.</description>
