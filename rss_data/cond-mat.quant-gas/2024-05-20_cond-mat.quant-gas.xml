      <title>Atomic Vibration Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously in vibration sensors, optical glass plates, optical fibres, carbon nanotubes, semiconductor materials, piezoelectric materials and molecules are proved to be effective transducers for sensing vibrations. In this work, for the first time, we will propose a model of vibration sensor using single atoms in low temperature. In this apparatus, information of mechanical vibration could be transferred into shaking of optical lattice through one of a cavity mirror. Shaking lattice consequently induces Mott insulator due to quantum interference. It is found that information of vibration is encoded in the atomic current and it could be extracted by Fourier transformations. The present atomic vibration sensor has wide detection range of frequency with high precision. Our present model of sensor based on atomic system opens a new area of studying vibration sensors.</description>

      <title>Fast transport and splitting of spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of tunable spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates confined within a harmonic trap, focusing on rapid transport, spin manipulation, and splitting dynamics. Using shortcuts to adiabaticity, we design time-dependent trap trajectories and spin-orbit-coupling strength to facilitate fast transport with simultaneous spin flip. Additionally, we showcase the creation of spin-dependent coherent states via engineering the spin-orbit-coupling strength. To deepen our understanding, we elucidate non-adiabatic transport and associated spin dynamics, contrasting them with simple scenarios characterized by constant spin-orbit coupling and trap velocity. Furthermore, we discuss the transverse Zeeman potential and nonlinear effect induced by interatomic interactions using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, highlighting the stability and feasibility of the proposed protocols for the state-of-the-art experiments with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>A Microscopic Description for Two Body Loss in Cold Atoms Near Feshbach Resonances with Strong Spontaneous Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two body loss dynamics of fermionic cold atoms near $s$- and $p$-wave Feshbach resonances with a microscopic Keldysh path integral formalism and compare the result to the macroscopic phenomenological loss rate equation. The microscopic loss rate equation is an integral-differential equation of the momentum distribution that depends on the functional form of the loss rate coefficient. For $s$-wave resonance, the microscopic theory yields the same result as the phenomenological equation. However, the calculation of $p$-wave resonance shows a discrepancy between the two descriptions for an quantum-degenerate gas. This discrepancy originates from the functional form of the loss coefficient which is associated with the microscopic loss mechanism of the two body loss and is neglected in the phenomenological equations where the coefficient is typically a constant. We find the discrepancy between the microscopic theory and the phenomenological description is smeared by thermal average at high temperature, $T\gtrsim T_F$ where $T_F$ is the Fermi temperature.</description>

      <title>Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation of Electron Transfer Models with Tunable Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. Exact simulation of reactions in these systems is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. In this work, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multi-species trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. We employ the ground-state qubit of one ion to simulate the electronic degree of freedom and the optical qubit of another ion to perform reservoir engineering on a collective mode encoding a reaction coordinate. We observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. The setup allows access to the electron transfer dynamics in the non-perturbative regime, where there is no clear hierarchy among the energy scales in the model, as has been suggested to be optimal for many rate phenomena, including photosynthesis. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for dilute systems with two-body decays in reduced dimensions</title>

Abstract: Physical systems in reduced dimensions exhibit intriguing properties. For instance, the dependences of two-body and many-body physics on scattering lengths are distinct from their counterparts in three dimensions. Whereas many studies of ultracold atoms and molecules in reduced dimensions have been focusing on closed systems, two-body losses may occur in such systems. Here, we show that the two-body inelastic loss rate in reduced dimensions can be expressed in universal relations that are governed by contacts. These universal relations correlate the two-body decay rate with other physical observables at arbitrary temperatures and interaction strengths. Our results will provide experimentalists with a new protocol to study inelastic scatterings in both few- and many-body systems in reduced dimensions.</description>

      <title>Sound, superfluidity and layer compressibility in a ring dipolar supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to excite the Goldstone modes of a supersolid dipolar Bose-Einstein condensed gas confined in a ring geometry. By abruptly removing an applied periodic modulation proportional to cos($\varphi$), where $\varphi$ is the azimuthal angle, we explore the resulting oscillations of the gas, by solving the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The value of the two longitudinal sound velocities exhibited in the supersolid phase are analyzed using the hydrodynamic theory of supersolids at zero temperature. This approach allows for the determination of the layer compressibility modulus as well as of the superfluid fraction $f_S$, in agreement with the Leggett estimate of the non-classical moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Quantum Turbulence: Pushing the Limits of High-Performance Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms provide a platform for analog quantum computer capable of simulating the quantum turbulence that underlies puzzling phenomena like pulsar glitches in rapidly spinning neutron stars. Unlike other platforms like liquid helium, ultracold atoms have a viable theoretical framework for dynamics, but simulations push the edge of current classical computers. We present the largest simulations of fermionic quantum turbulence to date and explain the computing technology needed, especially improvements in the ELPA library that enable us to diagonalize matrices of record size (millions by millions). We quantify how dissipation and thermalization proceed in fermionic quantum turbulence by using the internal structure of vortices as a new probe of the local effective temperature. All simulation data and source codes are made available to facilitate rapid scientific progress in the field of ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the modulational instability of plane wave solutions within a modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation framework. The equation features cubic and quartic nonlinearity. It models the behaviour of quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in symmetric Bose-Bose mixtures of ultra-dilute cold atoms. Our study demonstrates the pivotal role of the competition between mean-field attractions and quantum fluctuation-induced repulsions. This competition significantly affects the emergence and evolution of modulational instability. By employing linear stability analysis, we identify the essential conditions that lead to modulational instability. We find that the stability of plane wave solutions significantly depends on the interaction among system parameters. Further development of the instability leads to the fragmentation of the BEC into a chain of quantum droplets. We calculated the quantity of quantum droplets generated during the nonlinear phase of the instability. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations of the modified quasi-1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation. These simulations vividly depict the formation, interaction, and coalescence of droplets during the nonlinear phase of modulational instability. The investigation shows that linear stability analysis of the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, considering quantum fluctuations, precisely forecasts modulational instability phenomena across different domains of parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum reaction-limited reaction-diffusion dynamics of noninteracting Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum reaction-diffusion systems in one-dimension with bosonic particles that coherently hop in a lattice, and when brought in range react dissipatively. Such reactions involve binary annihilation ($A + A \to \emptyset$) and coagulation ($A + A \to A$) of particles at distance $d$. We consider the reaction-limited regime, where dissipative reactions take place at a rate that is small compared to that of coherent hopping. In classical reaction-diffusion systems, this regime is correctly captured by the mean-field approximation. In quantum reaction-diffusion systems, for non-interacting fermionic systems, the reaction-limited regime recently attracted considerable attention because it has been shown to give universal power law decay beyond mean-field for the density of particles as a function of time. Here, we address the question whether such universal behavior is present also in the case of the non-interacting Bose gas. We show that beyond mean-field density decay for bosons is possible only for reactions that allow for destructive interference of different decay channels. Furthermore, we study an absorbing-state phase transition induced by the competition between branching $A\to A+A$, decay $A\to \emptyset$ and coagulation $A+A\to A$. We find a stationary phase-diagram, where a first and a second-order transition line meet at a bicritical point which is described by tricritical directed percolation. These results show that quantum statistics significantly impact on both the stationary and the dynamical universal behavior of quantum reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Polaron spectra and edge singularities for correlated flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single- and two-particle spectra of a single immobile impurity immersed in a fermionic bath can be computed exactly and are characterized by divergent power laws (edge singularities). Here, we present the leading lattice correction to this canonical problem, by embedding both impurity and bath fermions in bands with non-vanishing Bloch band geometry, with the impurity band being flat. By analyzing generic Feynman diagrams, we pinpoint how the band geometry reduces the effective interaction which enters the power laws; we find that for weak lattice effects or small Fermi momenta, the leading correction is proportional to the Fermi energy times the sum of the quantum metrics of the bands. When only the bath fermion geometry is important, the results can be extended to large Fermi momenta and strong lattice effects and cross-validated by analysis of S-matrix eigenvalues. We numerically illustrate our results on the Lieb lattice and draw connections to ultracold gas experiments.</description>
