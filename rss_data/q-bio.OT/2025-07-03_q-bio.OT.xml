      <title>A Dopamine-Serotonin Theory of Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theory of consciousness grounded in mathematical formalism and supported by clinical data analysis. The framework developed herein demonstrates that consciousness exists as a continuous, non-monotonic function across a high-dimensional neurochemical space, with dopamine serving as the primary intensity regulator and serotonin (5-HT2A) as the complexity modulator. This work offers mechanistic explanations for the full spectrum of conscious states, from deep sleep and psychosis to the ultimate collapse in neural death. The theory explains paradoxical phenomena such as prefrontal cortex hypoactivity during seizures, the evolutionary persistence of psychosis-prone individuals, and why controlled administration of classical 5-HT2A agonists shows a comparatively low incidence of serious medical events (&lt; 0.01 % in modern clinical trials), while dopaminergic excess proves rapidly lethal. The framework is tested using 70,290 sleep nights from 242 Parkinson's disease patients, using disease severity (UPDRS) as a proxy for system integrity and medication (LEDD) as a proxy for dopaminergic input. The analysis reveals a significant LEDD x UPDRS interaction (beta=-1.7, p&lt;.0001), confirming the model's prediction of state-dependent, non-linear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Communicating Smartly in Molecular Communication Environments: Neural Networks in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.</description>
