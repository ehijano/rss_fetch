      <title>Primordial black holes in non-minimal coupling Gauss-Bonnet inflation in light of the NANOGrav 15 year data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in non-minimal coupling Gauss-Bonnet inflationary model in the presence of power-law potentials. We employ a two part coupling function to enhance primordial curvatures at small scales as well as satisfy Planck measurements at the CMB scale. Moreover, our model satisfies the swampland criteria. We find PBHs with different mass scales and demonstrate that PBHs with masses around $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14})M_{\odot}$ can account for almost all of the dark matter in the universe. In addition, we investigate the implications of the reheating stage and show that the PBHs in our model are generated during the radiation-dominated era. Furthermore, we investigate the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs). More interestingly enough, is that for the specific cases $D_{\rm n}$ in our model, the GWs can be considered as a source of NANOGrav signal. %evaluate the idea that the induced GWs propagating concurrently with the PBH production are the source of NANOGrav signal. Also, we conclude that the GWs energy density parameter at the nano-Hz regime can be parameterized as $\Omega_{\rm GW_0} (f) \sim f^{5-\gamma}$, where the obtained $\gamma$ is consistent with the NANOGrav 15 years data.</description>

      <title>Viable Wormhole Solutions in Modified Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the embedding class-I technique to examine the effect of charge on traversable wormhole geometry in the context of $f(\mathcal{G})$ theory, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Gauss-Bonnet term. For this purpose, we consider static spherical spacetime with anisotropic matter configuration to investigate the wormhole geometry. The Karmarkar condition is used to develop a shape function for the static wormhole structure. Using this developed shape function, we construct a wormhole geometry that satisfies all the required constraints and connects asymptotically flat regions of the spacetime. To analyze the existence of traversable wormhole geometry, we evaluate the behavior of energy conditions for various models of this theory. This study reveals that viable traversable wormhole solutions exist in this modified theory.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing exact solutions to relativistic stars in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a covariant description of non-vacuum static spherically symmetric spacetimes in $f(R)$-gravity applying the (1+1+2) covariant formalism. The propagation equations are then used to derive a covariant and dimensionless form of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. We then give a solution strategy to these equations and obtain a new exact solution for the particular case $f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Effects of $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}_{\gamma\upsilon}\mathcal{T}^{\gamma\upsilon})$ Gravity on Anisotropic Charged Compact Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the analysis of static spherically symmetric anisotropic solutions in the presence of electromagnetic field through the gravitational decoupling approach in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}_{\gamma\upsilon}\mathcal{T}^{\gamma\upsilon})$ gravity. We use geometric deformation only on radial metric function and obtain two sets of the field equations. The first set deals with isotropic fluid while the second set yields the influence of anisotropic source. We consider the modified Krori-Barua charged isotropic solution for spherical self-gravitating star to deal with the isotropic system. The second set of the field equations is solved by taking two different constraints. We then investigate physical acceptability of the obtained solutions through graphical analysis of the effective physical variables and energy conditions. We also analyze the effects of charge on different parameters, (i.e., mass, compactness and redshift) for the resulting solutions. It is found that our both solutions are viable as well as stable for specific values of the decoupling parameter $\varphi$ and charge. We conclude that a self-gravitating star shows more stable behavior in this gravity.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in the f(R,L,T) theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morris and Thorne developed wormhole solutions in the late 1980s when they discovered a recipe that wormholes must follow for travelers to cross them safely. They describe exotic matter as satisfying $-p_{r} &gt; \rho$, where $p_{r}$ is the radial pressure and $\rho$ is the energy density of the wormhole. This is a notable characteristic of the General Relativity Theory. The current article discusses traversable wormhole solutions in $f(R, L, T)=R+\alpha L+\beta T$, with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model parameters. The wormhole solutions presented here satisfy the metric constraints of traversability while remarkably avoiding the exotic matter condition, indicating that $f(R, L, T)$ gravity wormholes can be filled with ordinary matter. The derived solutions for the shape function of the wormhole meet the required metric conditions. They exhibit behavior that is comparable to that of wormholes reported in earlier references, which is also the case for our solutions for the energy density of such objects.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation with Non-Linear Memory: Breaking the Distance-Inclination Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the role of the non-linear memory effect in gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation, particularly we explore its capability to break the degeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination angle in binary coalescence events. Motivated by the rapid growth in GW detections and the increasing sensitivity of GW observatories enhancing the precision of cosmological and astrophysical measurements is crucial. We propose leveraging the non-linear memory effect -- a subtle, persistent feature in the GW signal resulting from the cumulative impact of emitted gravitational waves -- as a novel approach to enhance parameter estimation accuracy. Through a comprehensive series of injection studies, encompassing both reduced and full parameter spaces, we evaluate the effectiveness of non-linear memory in various scenarios for aligned-spin systems. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of non-linear memory in resolving the inclination-distance degeneracy, particularly for events with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR $&gt;$ 60) for the current generation of detectors and in the context of future detector sensitivities such as the planned LIGO A$^\sharp$ upgrade. The results also suggest that excluding non-linear memory from parameter estimation could introduce significant systematics in future LIGO A$^\sharp$ detections. This observation will hold even greater weight for next-generation detectors, highlighting the importance of including non-linear memory in GW models for achieving high-accuracy measurements for gravitational wave (GW) astronomy.</description>

      <title>Constraining the abundance of Galactic compact objects with continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic spinning compact objects (COs) with non-zero ellipticity are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars), and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs, from searches in LIGO-Virgo data, have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count $N_{tot}$ of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an "agnostic" set of upper limits on $N_{tot}$ evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ have abundance upper limits at $90\%$ confidence, of $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 100$, and those with $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ have $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 10^4$. We additionally place upper-limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances $N_{tot}$.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of renormalization group improved gravity from the kinematics of SPARC galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR) proposes a logarithmic running of the gravitational coupling $\left(G\right)$, resulting in a modified description of gravity. This has the potential to explain the observed kinematics of the galaxies, including the missing-mass problem. We, for the first time, based on the galaxy morphological types, investigate the dynamics of a diverse collection of galaxies present in the Spitzer Photometry for Accurate Rotation Curve (SPARC) catalog. We phenomenologically constrain the RGGR model parameter $\left(\bar\nu\right)$ along with the mass-to-light ratio for a sample of 100 SPARC galaxies, selected from four different morphological types, viz. early, spiral, late, and starburst. Our statistical analysis finds RGGR to fit the observed galaxy kinematics consistently. The constrained RGGR model parameter also supports the claim that it has a near-linear dependence on the galactic baryonic mass. From our morphology study, we find that the parameter $\bar\nu$ decreases from the early-type to the starburst galaxies. Finally, the renormalization group improved gravity is tested against the two established empirical relations for the SPARC catalog, viz., the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) and the Baryonic Tully Fisher relation (BTFR), both are found to be satisfied consistently.</description>

      <title>Energy extracted from Hartle-Thorne strange stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is discussed how Penrose process can be used in a strange star, described by the Hartle-Thorne metric, to extract its rotational energy. This metric has an ergosphere region that depends only on its angular momentum. It is shown that massive particles with negative energy can exist in this ergosphere, exploring the conditions on the radial distance and on angular momentum for this to occur. It is also calculated the total amount of rotational energy that can be extracted from the strange star, and how these conditions cannot be fulfilled by a star with regular matter.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations in anisotropic dark energy stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of both isotropic and anisotropic dark energy stars by using the modified Chaplygin prescription of dark energy to model the stellar matter. The anisotropic pressure in the system is modeled with Bowers-Liang prescription. By solving the stellar structure equations in presence of anisotropy, we study the global properties of the dark energy star and compare the mass-radius profiles with data from GW events and milli-second pulsars. We proceed to determine the prominent non-radial $l=2$ $f$-mode frequencies of the anisotropic dark energy star by employing the Cowling approximation and analyse and quantify the spectra by varying the anisotropic parameter. We report that $f$-mode spectra of dark energy star have distinctly different behaviour compared to neutron star and quark star, and this may possibly help in its future identification. Further, the tidal deformability factors of the anisotropic dark energy stars have also been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Sudden breakdown of effective field theory near cool Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that (near-)extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of small higher-derivative corrections to general relativity. In particular, these corrections produce diverging tidal forces on the horizon in the extremal limit. We show that adding a black hole charge makes this effect qualitatively stronger. Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Late-Time constraints on Interacting Dark Energy: Analysis independent of $H_0$, $r_d$ and $M_B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension, has been investigated. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>pAGN: the one-stop solution for AGN disc modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) find vast applications in high-energy astrophysics. The broad strategy is to parametrize some of the key disc properties such as gas density and temperature as a function of the radial coordinate from a given set of assumptions on the underlying physics. Two of the most popular approaches in this context were presented by Sirko &amp; Goodman (2003) and Thompson et al. (2005). We present a critical reanalysis of these widely used models, detailing their assumptions and clarifying some steps in their derivation that were previously left unsaid. Our findings are implemented in the pAGN module for the Python programming language, which is the first public implementation of these accretion-disc models. We further apply pAGN to the evolution of stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN discs, addressing the potential occurrence of migration traps.</description>

      <title>Probing AGN jet precession with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precession of astrophysical jets produced by active-galactic nuclei is likely related to the dynamics of the accretion disks surrounding the central supermassive black holes (BHs) from which jets are launched. The two main mechanisms that can drive jet precession arise from Lense-Thirring precession and tidal torquing. These can explain direct and indirect observations of precessing jets; however, such explanations often utilize crude approximations of the disk evolution and observing jet precession can be challenging with electromagnetic facilities. Simultaneously, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to measure gravitational waves from the mergers of massive binary BHs with high accuracy and probe their progenitor evolution. In this paper, we connect the LISA detectability of binary BH mergers to the possible jet precession during their progenitor evolution. We make use of a semi-analytic model that self-consistently treats disk-driven BH alignment and binary inspiral and includes the possibility of disk breaking. We find that tidal torquing of the accretion disk provides a wide range of jet precession timescales depending on the binary separation and the spin direction of the BH from which the jet is launched. Efficient disk-driven BH alignment results in shorter timescales of $\sim 1$ yr which are correlated with higher LISA signal-to-noise ratios. Disk breaking results in the longest possible times of $\sim 10^7$ yrs, suggesting a deep interplay between the disk critical obliquity (i.e. where the disk breaks) and jet precession. Studies such as ours will help to reveal the cosmic population of precessing jets that are detectable with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational-waves: all contributions from primordial non-Gaussianity $\fnl$ and $\gnl$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the primordial non-Gaussianity of inflationary perturbations is crucial for testing the inflation paradigm of the early universe. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the presence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity parameterized by $\fnl$ and $\gnl$, deriving their semi-analytical formulae for the first time. Our findings indicate that it is the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity that leads to a non-Gaussian SIGW background, suggesting that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of SIGWs could serve as probes of the primordial non-Gaussianity. Our numerical results further illustrate that $\fnl$ and $\gnl$ exert significant impacts on the spectral amplitudes, potentially reaching up to $10^{-5}$ for the former and $10^{-8}$ for the latter. In particular, we demonstrate that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum exhibit characteristic dependence on the angular multipoles and frequency bands. They hold potentials to be measured by gravitational-wave detectors that may advance our understanding of the origin of the universe.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

Abstract: We construct Carroll-invariant theories with fields propagating outside the Carroll lightcone, i.e., at a speed strictly greater than zero (`Carroll swiftons'). We first consider models in flat Carroll spacetime in general dimensions, where we present scalar and vector Carroll swifton field theories. We then turn to the coupling to gravity and achieve in particular in two dimensions a Carroll invariant scalar swifton by coupling it suitably to Carroll dilaton gravity. Its backreaction on the geometry generates dynamical torsion.</description>

      <title>New probe of non-Gaussianities with primordial black hole induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new probe of primordial non-Gaussianities (NGs) through the observation of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by ultra-light ($M_{\text{PBH}}&lt; 10^{9}\rm{g}$) primordial black holes (PBHs). Interestingly enough, the existence of primordial NG can leave imprints on the clustering properties of PBHs and the spectral shape of induced GW signals. Focusing on a scale-dependent local-type NG, we identify a distinct double-peaked GW energy spectrum that, contingent upon $M_{\text{PBH}}$ and the abundance of PBHs at the time of formation, denoted as $\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, may fall into the frequency bands of upcoming GW observatories, including LISA, ET, SKA, and BBO. Thus, such a signal can serve as a novel portal for probing primordial NGs. Intriguingly, combining BBN bounds on the GW amplitude, we find for the first time the joint limit on the product of the effective non-linearity parameter for the primordial tri-spectrum, denoted by $\bar{\tau}_\mathrm{NL}$, and the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k)$, which reads as $\bar{\tau}_\mathrm{NL} \mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k) &lt; 4\times 10^{-20} \Omega^{-17/9}_\mathrm{PBH,f} \left( \frac{M_{\rm PBH}}{10^4\mathrm{g}} \right)^{-17/9}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general relativity as well as gauge theories, non-trivial symmetries can appear at boundaries. In the presence of radiation some of the symmetries are not Hamiltonian vector fields, hence the definition of charges for the symmetries becomes delicate. It can lead to the problem of field-dependent 2-cocycles in the charge algebra, as opposed to the central extensions allowed in standard classical mechanics. We show that if the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, its covariance requirement guarantees that the algebra of Noether currents is free of field-dependent 2-cocycles, and its stationarity requirement further removes central extensions. Therefore the charge algebra admits at most a time-independent field-dependent 2-cocycle, whose existence depends on the boundary conditions. We report on new results for asymptotic symmetries at future null infinity that can be derived with this approach.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that nonlinear electrodynamics of the Born--Infeld theory type may be exploited to shed insight into a few fundamental problems in theoretical physics, including rendering electromagnetic asymmetry to energetically exclude magnetic monopoles, achieving finite electromagnetic energy to relegate curvature singularities of charged black holes, and providing theoretical interpretation of equations of state of cosmic fluids via k-essence cosmology. Also discussed are some nonlinear differential equation problems.</description>

      <title>Effects of orbital precession on hyperbolic encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hyperbolic encounters of two massive objects are characterized by the emission of a gravitational wave burst, with most of the energy released during the closest approach (near the periastron). The detection of such events, different from the well-known inspiral emission, would be an interesting discovery and provide complementary information to observations of binary mergers of black holes and neutron stars in the observable Universe, shedding light, for instance, on the clustering properties of black holes and providing valuable hints on their formation scenario. Here, we analyze the dynamics of such phenomena in the simplest case where two compact objects follow unbound/hyperbolic orbits. Moreover, we explore the effects of orbital precession on the gravitational wave emission, since the precession encodes certain general relativistic effects between two bodies. We also provide templates for the strain of gravitational waves and the power spectrum for the emission, and analytical expressions for the memory effect associated with such signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the Hayward regular black hole using both Euclidean path integral and Hamiltonian methods, in asymptotically anti-de Sitter, Minkowski, and de Sitter spacetimes. With the inclusion of matter fields which act as a source for the regular black hole geometry, an effective temperature emerges that differs from the conventional definition related to the Killing surface gravity. We posit that this temperature is the appropriate choice for studying thermodynamic phenomena, by demonstrating consistency between the Euclidean and Hamiltonian formulations in the appropriate limits. We examine the thermodynamic properties and phase structure of the Hayward black hole in the canonical ensemble and show that, counter to some earlier indications, standard mean-field theory critical behavior is observed when the cosmological constant is treated as a thermodynamic pressure. We note the absence of a Hawking-Page transition, and conjecture that quantum gravity corrections which are suitably strong to regulate the Schwarzschild singularity generically prevent the transition from occurring. We also show that the Smarr relation remains linear in all cases, despite the absence of a linearity proof for nonlinear electrodynamic theories with nonsymmetry inheriting fields.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the $1+1+2$ covariant formalism in the presence of nonmetricity. Focusing on static and Locally Rotationally Symmetric spacetimes, we show how nonmetricity affects all the kinematic quantities involved in the covariant $1+1+2$ decomposition. We apply the resulting geometrical framework to study spherically symmetric solutions in the context of $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity in vacuum. We obtain explicit solutions and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schwarzschild-de Sitter type solutions.</description>

Abstract: Black hole horizons in equilibrium and null infinity of asymptotically flat space-times are null 3-manifolds but have very different physical connotations. We first show that they share a large number of geometric properties, making them both weakly isolated horizons. We then use this new unified perspective to unravel the origin of the drastic differences in the physics they contain. Interestingly, the themes are woven together in a manner reminiscent of voices in a fugue.</description>

Abstract: In this work we shall explore the effects of non commutativity in fractional classical and quantum schemes using the flat Friedmmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological model coupled to a scalar field in the K-essence formalism. In previous work we have obtained the commutative solutions in both regimes into the fractional framework. Here we introduce noncommutative variables, considering that all minisuperspace variables $\rm q^i_{nc}$ do not commute, so the symplectic structure was modified. In the quantum regime, the probability density presents new structure in the scalar field corresponding to the value of the non-commutative parameter, in the sense that this probability density undergoes a shift back to the direction of the scale factor, causing classical evolution to arise earlier than in the commutative world.</description>

      <title>Tensor Perturbations from Bounce Inflation Scenario in f(Q) Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a bounce inflation cosmological scenario in the framework of the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity, namely f(Q) theory, and investigate the tensor perturbations therein. As is well-known, the tensor perturbations generated in the very early Universe (inflation and pre-inflation regions) can account for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) that are to be detected by the next generation of GW experiments. We discuss the stability condition of the tensor perturbations in the bounce inflation process and investigate in detail the evolution of the perturbation variable. The general form of the tensor power spectrum is obtained both for large as well as small scale modes. As a result, we show for both kinds of modes (short or long wavelength modes), and the tensor spectrum may get a positive tilt in the parametric range where the tensor perturbation proves to be stable -- this interestingly hints an enhancement of gravitational waves' amplitude in the background of the f(Q) bounce-inflation scenario. Moreover, we study the LQC-like scenario as a specific case of our model, in which, the primordial tensor power spectrum turns out to be nearly scale-invariant on both small and large scales.</description>

      <title>Maximum gravitational mass $M_{\rm TOV}=2.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}M_\odot$ inferred at about $3\%$ precision with multimessenger data of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximal gravitational mass of nonrotating neutron stars ($M_{\rm TOV}$) is one of the key parameters of compact objects and only loose bounds can be set based on the first principle. With reliable measurements of the masses and/or radii of the neutron stars, $M_{\rm TOV}$ can be robustly inferred from either the mass distribution of these objects or the reconstruction of the equation of state (EoS) of the very dense matter. For the first time we take the advantages of both two approaches to have a precise inference of $M_{\rm TOV}=2.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~M_\odot$ (68.3\% credibility), with the updated neutron star mass measurement sample, the mass-tidal deformability data of GW170817, the mass-radius data of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the theoretical information from the chiral effective theory ($\chi$EFT) and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) at low and very high energy densities, respectively. This narrow credible range is benefited from the suppression of the high $M_{\rm TOV}$ by the pQCD constraint and the exclusion of the low $M_{\rm TOV}$ by the mass function. Three different EoS reconstruction methods are adopted separately, and the resulting $M_{\rm TOV}$ and $R_{\rm TOV}$ are found to be almost identical, where $R_{\rm TOV}=11.90^{+0.63}_{-0.60}$ km is the radius of the most massive non-rotating NS. This precisely evaluated $M_{\rm TOV}$ suggests that the EoS of neutron star matter is just moderately stiff and the $\sim 2.5-3M_\odot$ compact objects detected by the second generation gravitational wave detectors are most likely the lightest black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave triggered searches for high-energy neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers: prospects for next generation detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors -- Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will have distance horizons up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Gpc for detecting binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. This will make them ideal for triggering high-energy neutrino searches from BNS mergers at the next generation neutrino detectors, such as IceCube-Gen2. We calculate the distance limits as a function of the time window of neutrino analysis, up to which meaningful triggers from the GW detectors can be used to minimize backgrounds and collect a good sample of high-energy neutrino events at the neutrino detectors, using the sky localization capabilities of the GW detectors. We then discuss the prospects of the next generation detectors to work in synergy to facilitate coincident neutrino detections or to constrain the parameter space in the case of non-detection of neutrinos. We show that good localization of GW events, which can be achieved by multiple third generation GW detectors, is necessary to detect a GW-associated neutrino event or put a meaningful constraint ($\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level) on neutrino emission models. Such an analysis can also help constrain physical models and hence provide insights into neutrino production mechanisms in binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gauge preheating following pseudoscalar-driven inflation in full general relativity. We implement the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) scheme to solve the full nonlinear evolution of the metric alongside the dynamics of the pseudoscalar and gauge fields. The dynamics of the background and emission of gravitational waves are broadly consistent with simulations in a Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. We find large, localized overdensities in the BSSN simulations of order $\delta = \delta\rho/\rho \sim 30$, and the dimensionless power spectrum of $\delta$ peaks above unity. These overdense regions are seeded on length scales only slightly smaller than the horizon, and have a compactness $C \sim 0.1$. The scale of peak compactness is shorter than the Jeans length, which implies that pressure of the matter fields plays an important role in the evolution of these objects.</description>

      <title>2PM waveform from loop corrected soft theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical version of the loop corrected soft graviton theorem and we use it to compute the universal part of the one-loop (2PM) waveform up to sub-subleading order in the energy $\omega$ of the emitted graviton for spinless black-hole scattering. In particular, we compute the action of the soft operators on the classically resummed four-point amplitude, that can be written in terms of the exponential of the eikonal phase (and is therefore non-perturbative in the Newton's constant $G_N$) and then we perform the usual PM expansion in powers of $G_N$ . We find perfect agreement with the existing 2PM literature at the orders $\omega^{-1}$, $\log\omega$ and $\omega\log^2\omega$, which are universal. Furthermore, we use this method to compute the universal part of the $\omega\log\omega$ contribution to the 2PM waveform. Even if in the present analysis we limit ourselves to compute the soft 2PM waveform, our general formulae can be used to extract all universal PM orders of the terms connected with the infrared divergences, once the impulse at the corresponding precision is known. Our approach, based on the resummed eikonal amplitude, gives a unified picture of the various computations of the classical soft graviton behaviour that are present in the literature since the seminal paper by Weinberg in 1965.</description>

      <title>Black-hole formation in binary neutron star mergers: The impact of spin on the prompt-collapse scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the multi-messenger signatures connected to binary neutron star mergers requires proper knowledge on the final remnant's fate and the conditions under which black holes (BHs) can form in such mergers. In this article, we use a suite of 84 numerical-relativity simulations in 28 different physical setups to explore the impact of the individual stars' spin on the merger outcome and on the early postmerger dynamics. We find that for setups close to the prompt-collapse threshold, the stars' intrinsic spin significantly changes the lifespan of the remnant before collapse and that the mass of the debris disk surrounding the BH is also altered. To enable a better understanding of BH formation, we check if there is at least a theoretical chance of observing densities that are above the maximum density allowed in a stable isolated neutron star, and we investigate the importance of different pressure contributions on the evolution of the postmerger remnant and BH formation.</description>
