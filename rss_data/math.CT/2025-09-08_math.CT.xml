      <title>A limit lifting theorem for fibrations between bicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard result from the theory of Grothendieck fibrations states that if $p : E \to B$ is a fibration, then $E$ has limits of shape $\mathcal{J}$ if $B$ has limits of shape $\mathcal{J}$ the fibers of $\mathcal{E}$ have limits of shape $\mathcal{J}$, and the reindexing functors preserve these limits. Such a result is a basic tool when computing limits in a category known to be the total category of a fibration, for example, one that is defined using the Grothendieck construction. This paper states and proves a generalization of this theorem for fibrations between bicategories.</description>

      <title>Enriched bi(co)ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the theory of ends and coends in the context of enriched bicategories. This will be an enriched version of the theory introduced in [Cor16], and a bicategorical version of the classical theory of enriched (co)ends, which can be found in [Kel05] or in the more recent [Lor21]. One of the main obstacles to the construction of such a theory is the amount of structure involved at this stage of categorification. A great help will be furnished by strictification results (Section 2), as well as the powerful tool of string diagrams (Section 3), essential for making calculations manageable by a human being.</description>

      <title>Partializations of Markov categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work develops a construction of a CD category of partial kernels from a particular type of Markov category called a partializable Markov category. These are a generalization of earlier models of categories of partial morphisms such as p-categories, dominical categories, restriction categories, etc. to a non-deterministic/non-cartesian setting. Here all morphisms are quasi-total, with a natural poset enrichment corresponding to one morphism being a restriction of the other. Furthermore, various properties important to categorical probability are preserved, such as positivity, representability, conditionals, Kolmogorov products, and splittings of idempotents. We additionally discuss an alternative notion of Kolmogorov product suitable for partial maps, as well as partial algebras for probability monads.
  The primary example is that of the partialization of the category of standard Borel spaces and Markov kernels. Other examples include variants where the distributions are finitely supported, or where one considers multivalued maps instead.</description>

      <title>Virtually Gorenstein algebras of infinite dominant dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the Nakayama conjecture which states that algebras of infinite dominant dimension should be self-injective, we study self-orthogonal modules with virtually Gorenstein endomorphism algebras and prove the following result: Given a finitely generated, self-orthogonal module over an Artin algebra with an orthogonal condition on its Nakayama translation, if its endomorphism algebra is virtually Gorenstein, then the module is projective. As a consequence, we re-obtain a recent result: the Nakayama conjecture holds true for the class of strongly Morita, virtually Gorenstein algebras. Finally, we show that virtually Gorenstein algebras can be constructed from Frobenius extensions.</description>

      <title>Combs, Causality and Contractions in Atomic Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a counterexample showing that Markov categories with conditionals (such as BorelStoch) need not validate a natural scheme of axioms which we call contraction identities. These identities hold in every traced monoidal category, so in particular this shows that BorelStoch cannot be embedded in any traced monoidal category. We remedy this under the additional assumption of atomicity: Atomic Markov categories validate all contraction identities, and furthermore admit a notion of trace defined for non-signalling morphisms. We conclude that atomic Markov categories allow for an intrinsic theory of combs without having to assume an embedding into a compact-closed category.</description>

      <title>Rigid models for 2-gerbes I: Chern-Simons geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of constructing explicit geometric string structures, we give a rigid model for bundle 2-gerbes, and define connective structures thereon. This model is designed to make explicit calculations easier in applications to physics. To compare to the existing definition, we give a functorial construction of a bundle 2-gerbe as in the literature from our rigid model, including with connections. As an example we prove that the Chern--Simons bundle 2-gerbe from the literature, with its connective structure, can be rigidified -- it arises, up to isomorphism in the strongest possible sense, from a rigid bundle 2-gerbe with connective structure via this construction. Further, our rigid version of 2-gerbe trivialisation (with connections) gives rise to trivialisations (with connections) of bundle 2-gerbes in the usual sense, and as such can be used to describe geometric string structures.</description>

      <title>The Grorthendieck group of an extriangulated category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the split Grothendieck group $K^{\rm sp}_{0}(\mathcal{M})$ of a $d$-rigid subcategory $\mathcal{M}$ in an extriangulated category $\mathscr{C}$. As applications, we prove the following results: (1) If $\mathcal{M}$ is a silting subcategory, then the Grothendieck group $K_{0}(\mathscr{C})$ is isomorphic to $K_{0}^{\rm sp}(\mathcal{M})$; (2) If $\mathcal{M}$ is a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory, then $K_{0}(\mathscr{C})$ is isomorphic to the index Grothendieck group $K_{0}^{\rm in}(\mathcal{M})$; (3) Let $\mathcal{C}_{A_{n}}^{d}$ be the $d$-cluster category of type $A_n$. If $d$ is even, then $K_0(\mathcal{C}_{A_{n}}^{d})\cong \mathbb{Z}/(n+1)\mathbb{Z}$. If $d$ is odd, then $K_0(\mathcal{C}_{A_{n}}^{d})\cong \mathbb{Z}$ if $n$ is odd; $K_0(\mathcal{C}_{A_{n}}^{d})\cong 0$ if $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Balmer and Gallauer's (permutation) twisted cohomology ring, working toward an alternative method of deducing the Balmer spectrum of the derived category of permutation modules for any finite $p$-group. The construction comes equipped with a canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring. We show the comparison map is injective for any finite $p$-group and furthermore, an open immersion when the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian. For elementary abelian $p$-groups, the twisted cohomology ring coincides with Balmer and Gallauer's original construction.
  To perform this construction, we utilize endotrivial complexes (i.e. the invertible objects of the derived category of permutation modules) arising up to a shift from Bredon homology of representation spheres. This topological structure allows us to construct certain $p$-local isomorphisms, from which we build a refined open cover of the Balmer spectrum indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Under this open cover, every endotrivial is isomorphic to a shift of the tensor unit in each localization, thus verifying that all endotrivials are line bundles. When the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian, this open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure.</description>

      <title>An axiomatic approach to analytic $1$-affineness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of $1$-affineness was originally formulated by Gaitsgory in the context of derived algebraic geometry. Motivated by applications to rigid and analytic geometry, we introduce two very general and abstract frameworks where it makes sense to ask for objects to be $1$-affine with respect to some sheaf of categories. The first framework is suited for studying the problem of $1$-affineness when the sheaf of categories arises from an operation in a six-functor formalism over $\mathscr{C}$; we apply it to the setting of analytic stacks and condensed mathematics. The second one concerns $1$-affineness in the context of quasi-coherent sheaves of categorical modules over stable module categories: it simultaneously generalizes the algebro-geometric setting of Gaitsgory and makes it possible to formulate the problem also when dealing with rigid analytic varieties and categories of nuclear modules.</description>
