      <title>Theory of the Anderson transition in three-dimensional chiral symmetry classes: Connection to type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively.</description>

      <title>Distributed Lyapunov Functions for Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear networks are often multistable, exhibiting coexisting stable states with competing regions of attraction (ROAs). As a result, ROAs can have complex "tentacle-like" morphologies that are challenging to characterize analytically or computationally. In addition, the high dimensionality of the state space prohibits the automated construction of Lyapunov functions using state-of-the-art optimization methods, such as sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. In this letter, we propose a distributed approach for the construction of Lyapunov functions based solely on local information. To this end, we establish an augmented comparison lemma that characterizes the existence conditions of partial Lyapunov functions, while also accounting for residual effects caused by the associated dimensionality reduction. These theoretical results allow us to formulate an SOS optimization that iteratively constructs such partial functions, whose aggregation forms a composite Lyapunov function. The resulting composite function provides accurate convex approximations of both the volumes and shapes of the ROAs. We validate our method on networks of van der Pol and Ising oscillators, demonstrating its effectiveness in characterizing high-dimensional systems with non-convex ROAs.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in Hydrogen across the pressure-induced transition from molecular to atomic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersion of collective excitations in fluid Hydrogen along the isothermal line T=2500~K, including the region of molecular-to-atomis fluid transition, is studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The obtained density dependence of the adiabatic and high-frequency speed of sound contains a plateau in the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition. We show, that the five-variable thermo-viscoelastic model of generalized hydrodynamics for pure molecular H$_2$ and pure atomic (H) fluids is able to recover perfectly the AIMD-derived time correlation functions and sound eigenvalues nicely agree with the numerically estimated sound dispersion. In the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition a dynamic model of chemical reacting mixture should be applied. We discuss the calculations of time correlation functions from molecular/atomic units in the reacting mixture from AIMD trajectories.</description>

      <title>Kac-Rice inspired approach to non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) of non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The method, which represents an alternative to Girko Hermitization approach, is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we apply it to consider two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we discuss the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a possible generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.</description>

Abstract: The Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse $X^\dagger$, defined for rectangular matrices, naturally emerges in many areas of mathematics and science. For a pair of rectangular matrices $X, Y$ where the corresponding entries are jointly Gaussian and i.i.d., we analyse the support of the eigenvalue spectrum of $XY^\dagger$.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of metallic glass as a grain-boundary nucleated process: experimental and theoretical evidence for the grain structure of metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental DSC and Avrami curves for the crystallization of metallic glasses demonstrate nucleation at grain boundaries and thus indicate their grain structure, which refutes the generally accepted idea of glass as a homogeneous frozen liquid obtained as a result of avoiding crystallization. Under certain conditions, this nucleation mechanism results in the appearance of two-peak DSC curves and three-step Avrami plots which are observed experimentally. To clarify these conditions, isothermal and non-isothermal surface-nucleated crystallization of a spherical particle is considered within the framework of a simple analytical model of nucleation and growth.</description>

      <title>Molecular motion at the experimental glass transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to study numerically the glass transition of molecular fluids. Our approach combines the construction of simple yet realistic models with the development of Monte Carlo algorithms to accelerate equilibration and sampling. Inspired by the well-studied ortho-terphenyl glass-former, we construct a molecular model with an analogous triangular geometry and construct a `flip' Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate that the flip Monte Carlo algorithm achieves a sampling speedup of about $10^9$ at the experimental glass transition temperature $T_g$. This allows us to systematically analyze the equilibrium structure and molecular dynamics of the model over a temperature regime previously inaccessible. We carefully compare the observed physical behavior to earlier studies that used atomistic models. In particular, we find that the glass fragility and the departure from the Stokes-Einstein relation are much closer to experimental observations. We characterize the development and temperature evolution of spatial correlations in the relaxation dynamics, using both orientational and translational degrees of freedom. Excess wings emerge at intermediate frequencies in dynamic rotational spectra, and we directly visualize the corresponding molecular motion near $T_g$. Our approach can be generalized to a number of molecular geometries and paves the way to a complete understanding of how molecular details may affect more universal physical aspects characterizing molecular liquids approaching their glass transition.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control of Spin Magnetometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control in the presence of decoherence is difficult, particularly when not all Hamiltonian parameters are known precisely, as in quantum sensing applications. In this context, maximizing the sensitivity of the system is the objective, for which the optimal target state or unitary transformations are unknown, especially in the case of multi-parameter estimation. Here, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, for problems in quantum optimal control. We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system for the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a background magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective measurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by applying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL agent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a transverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to existing sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against various Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to investigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find that the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as the pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to generalize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of localization effects in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model via topolectrical circuits</title>

Abstract: Anderson localization and the non-Hermitian skin effect are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are driven, respectively, by disorder and nonreciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian version of the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate a delocalization-localization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between Anderson localization and the skin effect can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate that quantum jumps between the skin states and the Anderson-localized states occur in the theoretical model. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The voltage profile of the circuit exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the skin effect, while the phenomenon of Anderson localization in the circuit can be perceived via a predicted localization behavior near the excitation node, rather than exhibiting sudden non-Hermitian jumps, as observed in the tight-binding framework. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the output voltage of the circuit. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits, opening avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic systems such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient devices for information transfer and communication.</description>

Abstract: We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.</description>
