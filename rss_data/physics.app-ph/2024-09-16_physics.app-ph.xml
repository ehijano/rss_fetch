      <title>Color Centers in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an essential material for the encapsulation layer in van der Waals heterostructures and efficient deep ultra-violet optoelectronics. This is primarily due to its remarkable physical properties and ultrawide bandgap (close to 6 eV, and even larger in some cases) properties. Color centers in hBN refer to intrinsic vacancies and extrinsic impurities within the 2D crystal lattice, which result in distinct optical properties in the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) range. Furthermore, each color center in hBN exhibits a unique emission spectrum and possesses various spin properties. These characteristics open up possibilities for the development of next-generation optoelectronics and quantum information applications, including room-temperature single-photon sources and quantum sensors. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the atomic configuration, optical and quantum properties, and different techniques employed for the formation of color centers in hBN. A deep understanding of color centers in hBN allows for advances in the development of next-generation UV optoelectronic applications, solid-state quantum technologies, and nanophotonics by harnessing the exceptional capabilities offered by hBN color centers.</description>

      <title>Overcoming stress limitations in SiN nonlinear photonics via a bilayer waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (SiN) formed via low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) is an ideal material platform for on-chip nonlinear photonics owing to its low propagation loss and competitive nonlinear index. Despite this, LPCVD SiN is restricted in its scalability due to the film stress when high thicknesses, required for nonlinear dispersion engineering, are deposited. This stress in turn leads to film cracking and makes integrating such films in silicon foundries challenging. To overcome this limitation, we propose a bilayer waveguide scheme comprised of a thin LPCVD SiN layer underneath a low-stress and low-index PECVD SiN layer. We show group velocity dispersion tuning at 1550nm without concern for filmcracking while enabling low loss resonators with intrinsic quality factors above 1 million. Finally, we demonstrate a locked, normal dispersion Kerr frequency comb with our bilayer waveguide resonators spanning 120nm in the c-band with an on-chip pump power of 350mW.</description>

      <title>Single-photon detectors on arbitrary photonic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting non-classical light is a central requirement for photonics-based quantum technologies. Unrivaled high efficiencies and low dark counts have positioned superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) as the leading detector technology for fiber and integrated photonic applications. However, a central challenge lies in their integration within photonic integrated circuits regardless of material platform or surface topography. Here, we introduce a method based on transfer printing that overcomes these constraints and allows for the integration of SNSPDs onto arbitrary photonic substrates. We prove this by integrating SNSPDs and showing through-waveguide single-photon detection in commercially manufactured silicon and lithium niobate on insulator integrated photonic circuits. Our method eliminates bottlenecks to the integration of high-quality single-photon detectors, turning them into a versatile and accessible building block for scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multiplexed Metasurfaces for Multi-Task Learning with All-Optical Diffractive Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive Neural Networks (DNNs) leverage the power of light to enhance computational performance in machine learning, offering a pathway to high-speed, low-energy, and large-scale neural information processing. However, most existing DNN architectures are optimized for single tasks and thus lack the flexibility required for the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks within a unified artificial intelligence platform. In this work, we utilize the polarization and wavelength degrees of freedom of light to achieve optical multi-task identification using the MNIST, FMNIST, and KMNIST datasets. Employing bilayer cascaded metasurfaces, we construct dual-channel DNNs capable of simultaneously classifying two tasks, using polarization and wavelength multiplexing schemes through a meta-atom library. Numerical evaluations demonstrate performance accuracies comparable to those of individually trained single-channel, single-task DNNs. Extending this approach to three-task parallel recognition reveals an expected performance decline yet maintains satisfactory classification accuracies of greater than 80% for all tasks. We further introduce a novel end-to-end joint optimization framework to redesign the three-task classifier, demonstrating substantial improvements over the meta-atom library design and offering the potential for future multi-channel DNN designs. Our study could pave the way for the development of ultrathin, high-speed, and high-throughput optical neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Phonon-Limited Transport in Two-Dimensional Electronics by Oxygen-Free Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future electronics require aggressive scaling of channel material thickness while maintaining device performance. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising candidates, but despite over two decades of research, experimental performance still lags theoretical expectations. Here, we develop an oxygen-free approach to push the electrical transport of 2D field-effect transistors toward the theoretical phonon-limited intrinsic mobility. We achieve record carrier mobilities of 91 (132) cm2V-1s-1 for mono- (bi-) layer MoS2 transistors on SiO2 substrate. Statistics from over 60 devices confirm that oxygen-free fabrication enhances key figures of merit by more than an order of magnitude. While previous studies suggest that 2D transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2 and WS2 are stable in air, we show that short-term ambient exposure can degrade their device performance through irreversible oxygen chemisorption. This study emphasizes the criticality of avoiding oxygen exposure, offering guidance for device manufacturing for fundamental research and practical applications of 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are spectral singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenstates coalesce simultaneously. In this study, we calculate scattering poles in an open spherical solid and propose a depth-first search-based method to identify EPs. Using the proposed method, we numerically identify multiple EPs in a parameter space and confirm the simultaneous degeneracy of scattering poles through numerical experiments. The proposed method and findings enable the exploration of applications in practical three-dimension models.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Investigation of PbSe Thermoelectric Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric characteristics of lead selenium (PbSe) doped with gallium (Ga) are investigated in this study. When the lead sulfide (PbSe) is tuned with appropriate dopants, it exhibits satisfactory ZT values, hence making it a promising thermoelectric material. This study examines the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and power factor of PbSe, with varying amounts of added Ga. Results indicate that incorporating Ga into PbSe improves its thermoelectric performance, with a maximum ZT value of approximately 1.2 at 873 K for the optimal doping concentration of 0.005 atomic percent. This improvement is attributed to the combined effects of increased electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity. These findings suggest that Ga-doped PbSe is a promising candidate for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Confocal Raman Microscopy with Adaptive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confocal Raman microscopy, a highly specific and label-free technique for the microscale study of thick samples, often presents difficulties due to weak Raman signals. Inhomogeneous samples introduce wavefront aberrations that further reduce these signals, requiring even longer acquisition times. In this study, we introduce adaptive optics to confocal Raman microscopy for the first time to counteract such aberrations, significantly increasing the Raman signal and image quality. The method is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing commercial microscopes without hardware modifications. It uses a wavefront sensorless approach to derive aberrations using an optofluidic, transmissive spatial light modulator that can be attached to the microscope nosepiece. Our experimental results demonstrate the compensation of aberrations caused by artificial scatterers and mouse brain tissue, improving spatial resolution and achieving up to 3.5-fold signal enhancements. Our results provide a basis for the molecular label-free study of biological systems at greater imaging depths.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectrical potential and derivation of Kelvin relation for thermoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current research on thermoelectricity is primarily focused on the exploration of materials with enhanced performance, resulting in a lack of fundamental understanding of the thermoelectric effect. Such circumstance is not conducive to the further improvement of the efficiency of thermoelectric conversion. Moreover, available physical images of the derivation of the Kelvin relations are ambiguous. Derivation processes are complex and need a deeper understanding of thermoelectric conversion phenomena. In this paper, a new physical quantity 'thermoelectrical potential' from the physical nature of the thermoelectric conversion is proposed. The quantity is expressed as the product of the Seebeck coefficient and the absolute temperature, i.e., ST. Based on the thermoelectrical potential, we clarify the conversion of the various forms of energy in the thermoelectric effect by presenting a clear physical picture. Results from the analysis of the physical mechanism of the Seebeck effect indicate that the thermoelectrical potential, rather than the temperature gradient field, exerts a force on the charge carriers in the thermoelectric material. Based on thermoelectric potential, the Peltier effects at different material interfaces can be macroscopically described. The Kelvin relation is rederived using the proposed quantity, which simplified the derivation process and elucidated the physical picture of the thermoelectrical conversion.</description>

      <title>Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using an Offset-Charge-Sensitive Transmon Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using an offset-charge-sensitive transmon coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</description>

      <title>Unified Model for Probing Solar Cell Dynamics via Cyclic Voltammetry and Impedance Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in emerging solar cell technologies such as hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, there are still significant limitations related to the stability of the devices and their non-ideal electrical behavior under certain external stimuli. We present a conceptual framework for characterizing photovoltaic devices by integrating cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance spectroscopy (IS). This framework is constructed from a microscopic, multi-mode perspective that explicitly accounts for drift, diffusion, displacement, and memory contributions. We derive comprehensive analytical expressions for current-voltage relationships and complex admittance. Our model reveals the inseparable connection between hysteresis behaviors in current-voltage characteristics observed in CV and the apparent capacitive and inductive behaviors seen in IS spectral analysis. We demonstrate how CV and IS naturally complement each other, providing a deeper microscopic understanding of device performance and limitations. Additionally, we establish the relationship between intrinsic material parameters and experimentally accessible extrinsic parameters such as light intensity, temperature, DC bias, voltage amplitude, and frequency. This framework enables unprecedented optimization of solar cell performance, marking a significant advancement towards sustainability.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Photon Blockade for Nonreciprocal Quantum Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>
