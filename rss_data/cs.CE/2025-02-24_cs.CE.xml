      <title>Revisiting Financial Sentiment Analysis: A Language Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial Sentiment Analysis (FSA) traditionally relies on human-annotated sentiment labels to infer investor sentiment and forecast market movements. However, inferring the potential market impact of words based on human-perceived intentions is inherently challenging. We hypothesize that the historical market reactions to words, offer a more reliable indicator of their potential impact on markets than subjective sentiment interpretations by human annotators. To test this hypothesis, a market-derived labeling approach is proposed to assign tweet labels based on ensuing short-term price trends, enabling the language model to capture the relationship between textual signals and market dynamics directly. A domain-specific language model was fine-tuned on these labels, achieving up to an 11% improvement in short-term trend prediction accuracy over traditional sentiment-based benchmarks. Moreover, by incorporating market and temporal context through prompt-tuning, the proposed context-aware language model demonstrated an accuracy of 89.6% on a curated dataset of 227 impactful Bitcoin-related news events with significant market impacts. Aggregating daily tweet predictions into trading signals, our method outperformed traditional fusion models (which combine sentiment-based and price-based predictions). It challenged the assumption that sentiment-based signals are inferior to price-based predictions in forecasting market movements. Backtesting these signals across three distinct market regimes yielded robust Sharpe ratios of up to 5.07 in trending markets and 3.73 in neutral markets. Our findings demonstrate that language models can serve as effective short-term market predictors. This paradigm shift underscores the untapped capabilities of language models in financial decision-making and opens new avenues for market prediction applications.</description>

      <title>Digital Inheritance in Web3: A Case Study of Soulbound Tokens and the Social Recovery Pallet within the Polkadot and Kusama Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11074v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years discussions centered around digital inheritance have increased among social media users and across blockchain ecosystems. As a result digital assets such as social media content cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens have become increasingly valuable and widespread, leading to the need for clear and secure mechanisms for transferring these assets upon the testators death or incapacitation. This study proposes a framework for digital inheritance using soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet as a use case in the Polkadot and Kusama blockchain networks. The findings discussed within this study suggest that while soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet offer a promising solution for creating a digital inheritance plan the findings also raise important considerations for testators digital executors and developers. While further research is needed to fully understand the potential impacts and risks of other technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing this study provides a primer for users to begin planning a digital inheritance strategy and for developers to develop a more intuitive solution.</description>

      <title>Network topology of the Euro Area interbank market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing availability of large amounts of granular financial data, paired with the advances of big data related technologies induces the need of suitable analytics that can represent and extract meaningful information from such data. In this paper we propose a multi-layer network approach to distill the Euro Area (EA) banking system in different distinct layers. Each layer of the network represents a specific type of financial relationship between banks, based on various sources of EA granular data collections. The resulting multi-layer network allows one to describe, analyze and compare the topology and structure of EA banks from different perspectives, eventually yielding a more complete picture of the financial market. This granular information representation has the potential to enable researchers and practitioners to better apprehend financial system dynamics as well as to support financial policies to manage and monitor financial risk from a more holistic point of view.</description>

      <title>AutoTandemML: Active Learning Enhanced Tandem Neural Networks for Inverse Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design in science and engineering involves determining optimal design parameters that achieve desired performance outcomes, a process often hindered by the complexity and high dimensionality of design spaces, leading to significant computational costs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid approach that combines active learning with Tandem Neural Networks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of solving inverse design problems. Active learning allows to selectively sample the most informative data points, reducing the required dataset size without compromising accuracy. We investigate this approach using three benchmark problems: airfoil inverse design, photonic surface inverse design, and scalar boundary condition reconstruction in diffusion partial differential equations. We demonstrate that integrating active learning with Tandem Neural Networks outperforms standard approaches across the benchmark suite, achieving better accuracy with fewer training samples.</description>

      <title>Molecular Docking via Weighted Subgraph Isomorphism on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is an essential step in the drug discovery process involving the detection of three-dimensional poses of a ligand inside the active site of the protein. In this paper, we address the Molecular Docking search phase by formulating the problem in QUBO terms, suitable for an annealing approach. We propose a problem formulation as a weighted subgraph isomorphism between the ligand graph and the grid of the target protein pocket. In particular, we applied a graph representation to the ligand embedding all the geometrical properties of the molecule including its flexibility, and we created a weighted spatial grid to the 3D space region inside the pocket. Results and performance obtained with quantum annealers are compared with classical simulated annealing solvers.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Nonlinear Magnetic Equivalent Circuit for Design and Fast Analysis of Radial Flux Magnetic Gears with Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic gears offer significant advantages over mechanical gears, including contactless power transfer, but require efficient and accurate modeling tools for optimization and commercialization. This paper presents the first fast and accurate 2D nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model for radial flux magnetic gears (RFMG), capable of analyzing designs with bridges critical structural elements that introduce intense localized magnetic saturation. The proposed model systematically incorporates nonlinear effects while maintaining rapid simulation times through a parameterized geometry and adaptable flux tube distribution. A robust initialization strategy ensures reliable performance across diverse designs. Extensive validation against nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) confirms the model's accuracy in torque and flux density predictions. A comprehensive parametric study of 140,000 designs demonstrates close agreement with FEA results, with simulations running up to 100 times faster. Unlike previous MEC approaches, this model provides a generalized, computationally efficient solution for analyzing a wide range of RFMG designs with or without bridges, making it particularly well-suited for large scale design optimization.</description>

      <title>Tractable General Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Walrasian economies (or general equilibrium models) and their solution concept, the Walrasian equilibrium. A key challenge in this domain is identifying price-adjustment processes that converge to equilibrium. One such process, t\^atonnement, is an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by L\'eon Walras. While continuous-time variants of t\^atonnement are known to converge to equilibrium in economies satisfying the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP), the process fails to converge in a pathological Walrasian economy known as the Scarf economy. To address these issues, we analyze Walrasian economies using variational inequalities (VIs), an optimization framework. We introduce the class of mirror extragradient algorithms, which, under suitable Lipschitz-continuity-like assumptions, converge to a solution of any VI satisfying the Minty condition in polynomial time. We show that the set of Walrasian equilibria of any balanced economy-which includes among others Arrow-Debreu economies-corresponds to the solution set of an associated VI that satisfies the Minty condition but is generally discontinuous. Applying the mirror extragradient algorithm to this VI we obtain a class of t\^atonnement-like processes, which we call the mirror extrat\^atonnement process. While our VI formulation is generally discontinuous, it is Lipschitz-continuous in variationally stable Walrasian economies with bounded elasticity-including those satisfying WARP and the Scarf economy-thus establishing the polynomial-time convergence of mirror extrat\^atonnement in these economies. We validate our approach through experiments on large Arrow-Debreu economies with Cobb-Douglas, Leontief, and CES consumers, as well as the Scarf economy, demonstrating fast convergence in all cases without failure.</description>
