      <title>Novel quantum circuit for image compression utilizing modified Toffoli gate and quantized transformed coefficient alongside a novel reset gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17815</link>

Abstract: Quantum image computing has emerged as a groundbreaking field, revolutionizing how we store and process data at speeds incomparable to classical methods. Nevertheless, as image sizes expand, so does the complexity of qubit connections, posing significant challenges in the efficient representation and compression of quantum images. In response, we introduce a modified Toffoli gate state connection using a quantized transform coefficient preparation process. This innovative strategy streamlines circuit complexity by modifying state connection from the state connection information. In our operational control gates, only input 1 impacts the output, allowing us to modify the state connection and dramatically enhance the efficiency of the proposed circuit. As a result, the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of gates required for both image compression and representation. Our findings reveal that it requires an impressive 44.21 percent fewer gates than existing techniques, such as the Direct Cosine Transform Efficient Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (DCTEFRQI), all while maintaining a consistent peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). For an image block size of 2^Sx2^Sy with q gray levels, the complexity of our approach can be succinctly expressed as, O[3q+log2Sx+log2Sy+2q(log2Sx+log2Sy)]. Here, Sx and Sy represent the X and Y positional control gates while q indicates the non-zero transform coefficients. Moreover, experimental evaluations strongly demonstrate that it excels in both compressing and representing quantum images compared to the DCTEFRQI approach, particularly excelling in the essential metrics of gate requirements and PSNR performance. Embrace the future of quantum imaging with our innovative solution, where efficiency meets excellence.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on the Polymer's Identity: Microplastic Detection and Identification Through Nile Red Staining and Multispectral Imaging (FIMAP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread distribution of microplastics (MPs) in the environment presents significant challenges for their detection and identification. Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing plastic particle detectability and enabling accurate classification based on fluorescence behavior. However, conventional segmentation techniques face limitations, including poor signal-to-noise ratio, inconsistent illumination, thresholding difficulties, and false positives from natural organic matter (NOM). To address these challenges, this study introduces the Fluorescence Imaging Microplastic Analysis Platform (FIMAP), a retrofitted multispectral camera with four optical filters and five excitation wavelengths. FIMAP enables comprehensive characterization of the fluorescence behavior of ten Nile Red-stained MPs: HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, EPS, ABS, PVC, PC, PET, and PA, while effectively excluding NOM. Using K-means clustering for robust segmentation (Intersection over Union = 0.877) and a 20-dimensional color coordinate multivariate nearest neighbor approach for MP classification (&gt;3.14 mm), FIMAP achieves 90% precision, 90% accuracy, 100% recall, and an F1 score of 94.7%. Only PS was occasionally misclassified as EPS. For smaller MPs (35-104 microns), classification accuracy declined, likely due to reduced stain sorption, fewer detectable pixels, and camera instability. Integrating FIMAP with higher-magnification instruments, such as a microscope, may enhance MP identification. This study presents FIMAP as an automated, high-throughput framework for detecting and classifying MPs across large environmental sample volumes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model for Histogram Distribution-based Quantum Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum image representation and quantum measurement techniques has made quantum image processing research a hot topic. In this paper, a novel Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model (AQSM) is first proposed for scrambling watermark images. Then, on the basis of the proposed AQSM, a novel quantum watermarking scheme is presented. Unlike existing quantum watermarking schemes with fixed embedding scales, the proposed method can flexibly embed watermarks of different sizes. In order to improve the robustness of the watermarking algorithm, a novel Histogram Distribution-based Watermarking Mechanism (HDWM) is proposed, which utilizes the histogram distribution property of the watermark image to determine the embedding strategy. In order to improve the accuracy of extracted watermark information, a quantum refining method is suggested, which can realize a certain error correction. The required key quantum circuits are designed. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed quantum watermarking method are evaluated by simulation experiments on three image size scales. The results demonstrate the invisibility and good robustness of the watermarking algorithm.</description>

      <title>iTrash: Incentivized Token Rewards for Automated Sorting and Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As robotic systems (RS) become more autonomous, they are becoming increasingly used in small spaces and offices to automate tasks such as cleaning, infrastructure maintenance, or resource management. In this paper, we propose iTrash, an intelligent trashcan that aims to improve recycling rates in small office spaces. For that, we ran a 5 day experiment and found that iTrash can produce an efficiency increase of more than 30% compared to traditional trashcans. The findings derived from this work, point to the fact that using iTrash not only increase recyclying rates, but also provides valuable data such as users behaviour or bin usage patterns, which cannot be taken from a normal trashcan. This information can be used to predict and optimize some tasks in these spaces. Finally, we explored the potential of using blockchain technology to create economic incentives for recycling, following a Save-as-you-Throw (SAYT) model.</description>

      <title>Yoimiya: A Scalable Framework for Optimal Resource Utilization in ZK-SNARK Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Zero-Knowledge Proof systems, particularly ZK-SNARK, the efficiency of proof generation, encompassing both the witness generation and proof computation phases, has become a significant concern. While substantial efforts have successfully accelerated proof computation, progress in optimizing witness generation remains limited, which inevitably hampers overall efficiency. In this paper, we propose Yoimiya, a scalable framework with pipeline, to optimize the efficiency in ZK-SNARK systems. First, Yoimiya introduces an automatic circuit partitioning algorithm that divides large circuits of ZK-SNARK into smaller subcircuits, the minimal computing units with smaller memory requirement, allowing parallel processing on multiple units. Second, Yoimiya decouples witness generation from proof computation, and achieves simultaneous executions over units from multiple circuits. Moreover, Yoimiya enables each phase scalable separately by configuring the resource distribution to make the time costs of the two phases aligned, maximizing the resource utilization. Experimental results confirmed that our framework effectively improves the resource utilization and proof generation speed.</description>
