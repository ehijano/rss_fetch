Abstract: A recently reported gravito-electrostatic sheath (GES) model is procedurally applied to study the turbumagnetoactive helioseismic oscillation features on the entire bi-fluidic solar plasma system. The bounded solar interior plasma (SIP, internally self-gravitating) and the unbounded solar wind plasma (SWP, externally point-gravitating) are coupled through the interfacial diffused solar surface boundary (SSB) due to an exact gravito-electrostatic interplay. A numerical platform on the developed theoretic formalism reveals the evolution of both dispersive and non-dispersive features of the modified GES mode fluctuations in new parametric windows. Different colourspectral profiles exhibit important features of the GES-based SIP-SWP perturbations elaborately. It is illustratively shown that the thermostatistical GES stability depends mainly on the radial distance, magnetic field, equilibrium plasma density, and plasma temperature. We see that their dispersive features are more pertinently pronounced in the self-gravitational domains (SIP) than the electrostatic ones (SWP). Besides, different characteristic parameters with accelerating (or decelerating) and stabilizing (or destabilizing) effects influencing the entire solar plasma stability are illustratively portrayed. We speculate that, in the SIP, the long-wave (gravitational-like) helioseismic fluctuations become highly dispersive showing more propagatory nature than the shorter ones (acoustic-like). The short waves show more propagatory propensity than the longer ones in the SSB and SWP regime. The reliability of our proposed investigation is bolstered along with the tentative applicability and future scope in light of the current solar observational scenarios, such as SOHO, STEREO, SDO, PSP, and SolO.</description>
