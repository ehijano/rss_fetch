      <title>Excitation of whistler-mode waves by an electron temperature anisotropy in a laboratory plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Naturally-occurring whistler-mode waves in near-Earth space play a crucial role in accelerating electrons to relativistic energies and scattering them in pitch angle, driving their precipitation into Earth's atmosphere. Here, we report on the results of a controlled laboratory experiment focusing on the excitation of whistler waves via temperature anisotropy instabilities--the same mechanism responsible for their generation in space. In our experiments, anisotropic energetic electrons, produced by perpendicularly propagating microwaves at the equator of a magnetic mirror, provide the free energy for whistler excitation. The observed whistler waves exhibit a distinct periodic excitation pattern, analogous to naturally occurring whistler emissions in space. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that this periodicity arises from a self-regulating process: whistler-induced pitch-angle scattering rapidly relaxes the electron anisotropy, which subsequently rebuilds due to continuous energy injection and further excites wave. Our results have direct implications for understanding the process and characteristics of whistler emissions in near-Earth space.</description>

      <title>Eulerian and Lagrangian electron energization during magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron energization by magnetic reconnection has historically been studied in the Lagrangian guiding-center framework. Insights from such studies include that Fermi acceleration in magnetic islands can accelerate electrons to high energies. An alternative Eulerian fluid formulation of electron energization was recently used to study electron energization during magnetic reconnection in the absence of magnetic islands. Here, we use particle-in-cell simulations to compare the Eulerian and Lagrangian models of electron energization in a setup where reconnection leads to magnetic island formation. We find the largest energization at the edges of magnetic islands. There, energization related to the diamagnetic drift dominates in the Eulerian model, while the Fermi related term dominates in the Lagrangian model. The models predict significantly different energization rates locally. A better agreement is found after integrating over the simulation domain. We show that strong magnetic curvature can break the magnetic moment conservation assumed by the Lagrangian model, leading to erroneous results. The Eulerian fluid model is a complete fluid description and accurately models bulk energization. However, local measurements of its constituent energization terms need not reflect locations where plasma is heated or accelerated. The Lagrangian guiding center model can accurately describe the energization of particles, but it cannot describe the evolution of the fluid energy. We conclude that while both models can be valid, they describe two fundamentally different quantities, and care should be taken when choosing which model to use.</description>

      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>
