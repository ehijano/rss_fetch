      <title>Ergodicity, KAM, FPUT</title>

Abstract: Boltzmann introduced the microcanonical ensemble in
  1868, \cite{Bo868-a}, and immediately attempted to give an
  example of a system whose stationary states would be described
  by the emsemble (as suggested also by his ergodic
  hypothesis). The example, \cite{Bo868-b}, has been recently
  shown to be incorrect, if taken literally: the point was to
  suppose that constants of motion, if any besides the energy,
  would necessarily be smooth functions; and soon later he warned
  on the dangers implicit in a similar assumption. Fifty years
  later Fermi wrote a paper attempting to prove that in general a
  nonlinear system should be ergodic, \cite{Fe923}: but his proof
  relied again on Boltzmann's assumption. Thirty-four more years
  elapsed, and Fermi returned on the problem collaborating with
  Pasta, Ulam, Tsingou: the surprise was that the considered non
  linear chain was apparently not following the ergodic
  hypothesis. In the same year Kolmogorov had proved the
  conservation of many quasi periodic motions in nonlinear
  perturbations of integrable systems, \cite{Ko954}: his theorem was
  considered, already a few years later, a possible explanation
  of the FPUT work, \cite{Fo992}. This was only the beginning of intense
  research: here a brief sketch is presented to illustrate the
  above themes and the connection with the multiscale aspects of
  the problems, and the ``Renormalization group method'' intended
  as a map $\RR$ whose iterations can be interpreted as
  successive magnifications, zooming on ever smaller regions of
  phase space in which motions develop closer and closer to the
  searched quasi periodic motion of given spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quantum multifractality as a probe of phase space in the Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the multifractal behavior of coherent states projected in the energy eigenbasis of the spin-boson Dicke Hamiltonian, a paradigmatic model describing the collective interaction between a single bosonic mode and a set of two-level systems. By examining the linear approximation and parabolic correction to the mass exponents, we find ergodic and multifractal coherent states and show that they reflect details of the structure of the classical phase space, including chaos, regularity, and features of localization. The analysis of multifractality stands as a sensitive tool to detect changes and structures in phase space, complementary to classical tools to investigate it. We also address the difficulties involved in the multifractal analyses of systems with unbounded Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>
