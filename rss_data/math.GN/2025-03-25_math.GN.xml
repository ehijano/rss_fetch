      <title>On continuous polynomials of the Mac\'ias space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the set of natural numbers. The Mac\'ias space $M(\mathbb{N})$ is the topological space $(\mathbb{N},\tau_M)$ where $\tau_M$ is generated by the collection of sets $\sigma_n := \{ m \in \mathbb{N} : \gcd(n, m) = 1 \}$. In this paper, we characterize the continuity of polynomials over $ M(\mathbb{N})$ and prove that the only continuous polynomials are monomials</description>

      <title>Bridging Graph-Theoretical and Topological Approaches: Connectivity and Jordan Curves in the Digital Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the connections between graph-theoretical and topological approaches in the study of the Jordan curve theorem for grids. Building on the foundational work of Rosenfeld, who developed adjacency-based concepts on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and the subsequent introduction of the topological digital plane $\mathbb{K}^2$ with the Khalimsky topology by Khalimsky, Kopperman, and Meyer, we investigate the interplay between these perspectives. Inspired by the work of Khalimsky, Kopperman, and Meyer, we define an operator $\Gamma^*$ transforming subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ into subsets of $\mathbb{K}^2$. This operator is essential for demonstrating how 8-paths, 4-connectivity, and other discrete structures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ correspond to topological properties in $\mathbb{K}^2$. Moreover, we address whether the topological Jordan curve theorem for $\mathbb{K}^2$ can be derived from the graph-theoretical version on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Our results illustrate the deep and intricate relationship between these two methodologies, shedding light on their complementary roles in digital topology.</description>

      <title>On closed embeddings in $P^N \cup Q^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a separable metrizable $X$ is a union of two disjoint 0-dimensional sets $E$, $F$, $E$ is absolutely $G_{\delta}$ and $F$ is absolutely $F_{\sigma\delta}$ then there is a closed embedding $h$ into the union of countable products of the irrationals and the rationals with $E$ being the preimage under $h$ of the countable product of the irrationals and $F$ being the preimage under $h$ of the countable product of the rationals. We prove also that for the set $H$ of points $x$ in the Hilbert cube such that for each $k$ there is $l$ with $x(2^k 3^l)=0$, whenever $A$ is an $F_{\sigma \delta}$ set in a compact one-dimensional space $X$, there is an embedding $h$ into the union of the countable product of the irrationals with added point $0$, and the countable product of the rationals, such that $A$ is the preimage under $h$ of the set $H$.</description>

      <title>The Scott space of lattice of closed subsets with supremum operator as a topological semilattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several equivalent conditions of the continuity of the supremum function $\Sigma C(X)\times\Sigma C(X)\rightarrow\Sigma C(X)$ under mild assumptions, where $C(X)$ denotes the lattice of closed subsets of a $T_0$ topological space.
  We also provide an example of a non-monotone determined space $X$ such that $\eta=\lambda x.{\downarrow}x\colon X\rightarrow\Sigma C(X)$ is continuous. Additionally, we show that a $T_0$ space is quasicontinuous (quasialgebraic) iff the lattice of its closed subsets is a quasicontinuous (quasialgebraic) domain by using $n$-approximation. Furthermore, we provide a necessary condition for when a topological space possesses a Scott completion. This allows us to give more examples which do not have Scott completions.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between productively Menger and productively Hurewicz spaces in models of $\mathfrak b=\mathfrak d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the interplay between productively Menger and productively Hurewicz subspaces of the Cantor space. In particular, we show that in the Laver model for the consistency of the Borel's conjecture these two notions coincide and characterize Hurewicz spaces. On the other hand, it is consistent with CH that there are productively Hurewicz subspaces of the Cantor space which are not productively Menger.</description>

      <title>The hyperspace of non-cut subcontinua of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a continuum $X$, let $C(X)$ be the hyperspace of all subcontinua of $X$. We consider the hyperspace $NC^{*}(X)=\{A\in C(X):X\setminus A$ is connected$\}$. In this paper we prove that the only locally connected continua $X$ for which $NC^{*}(X)$ is compact are the arcs and the simple closed curves. We also characterize the finite graphs $G$ for which $NC^{*}(G)$ is connected.</description>

      <title>Scales, products and the second row of the Scheeeprs diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider products of sets of reals with a combinatorial structure based on scales parameterized by filters. This kind of sets were intensively investigated in products of spaces with combinatorial covering properties as Hurewicz, Scheepers, Menger and Rothberger. We will complete this picture with focusing on properties from the second row of the Scheepers diagram. In particular we show that in the Miller model a product space of two $\mathfrak{d}$-concentrated sets has a strong covering property $\mathsf{S}_1(\Gamma,\Omega)$. We provide also counterexamples in products to demonstrate limitations of used methods.</description>
