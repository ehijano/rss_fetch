      <title>Dispersion relation for the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh Taylor instability in magnetized medium revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rayleigh Taylor instability (RTI) occurs at the interface between two fluids of different densities, notably when a heavier fluid sits above a lighter one in an effective gravitational field. This instability is relevant to many astrophysical systems where relativistic effects are significant. We examine the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh Taylor instability (RRTI) in a magnetized medium, allowing for relativistic fluid motion parallel to the interface. To simplify our derivations, we use an "intermediate frame" where fluids on both sides have the same Lorentz factor. Our analysis yields the dispersion relation for RRTI. We find that the instability occurs when the Atwood number $\mathcal{A}$ = $(\rho_1 h_1 - \rho_2 h_2) / (\rho_1 h_1 + \rho_2 h_2) &gt;0$, without requiring relativistic correction. Relativistic motion increases the effective inertia ($\rho \rightarrow \gamma_*^2 \rho$), weakening the magnetic field's suppression of the instability. In the laboratory frame, the instability growth rate is reduced due to time dilation. These analytical results may inform studies of instabilities in systems such as microquasars, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and radio pulsars.</description>

      <title>Helium as an Indicator of the Neutron-Star Merger Remnant Lifetime and its Potential for Equation of State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time until black hole formation in a binary neutron-star (NS) merger contains invaluable information about the nuclear equation of state (EoS) but has thus far been difficult to measure. We propose a new way to constrain the merger remnant's NS lifetime, which is based on the tendency of the NS remnant neutrino-driven winds to enrich the ejected material with helium. Based on the He I $\lambda 1083.3$ nm line, we show that the feature around 800-1200 nm in AT2017gfo at 4.4 days seems inconsistent with a helium mass fraction of $X_{\mathrm{He}} \gtrsim 0.05$ in the polar ejecta. Recent neutrino-hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnants are only compatible with this limit if the NS remnant collapses within 20-30 ms. Such a short lifetime implies that the total binary mass of GW170817, $M_\mathrm{\rm tot}$, lay close to the threshold binary mass for direct gravitational collapse, $M_\mathrm{thres}$, for which we estimate $M_{\mathrm{thres}}\lesssim 2.93 M_\odot$. This upper bound on $M_\mathrm{thres}$ yields upper limits on the radii and maximum mass of cold, non-rotating NSs, which rule out simultaneously large values for both quantities. In combination with causality arguments, this result implies a maximum NS mass of $M_\mathrm{max}\lesssim2.3 M_\odot$. The combination of all limits constrains the radii of 1.6 M$_\odot$ NSs to about 12$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 11.5$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.15 M$_\odot$. This $\sim2$ km allowable range then tightens significantly for $M_\mathrm{max}$ above $\approx2.15$ M$_\odot$. This rules out a significant number of current EoS models. The short NS lifetime also implies that a black-hole torus, not a highly magnetized NS, was the central engine powering the relativistic jet of GRB170817A. Our work motivates future developments...

      <title>A 3D Simulation of a Type II-P Supernova: from Core Bounce to Beyond Shock Breakout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to better connect core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) theory with its observational signatures, we have developed a simulation pipeline from the onset of core collapse to beyond shock breakout. Using this framework, we present a three-dimensional simulation study following the evolution from five seconds to over five days of a 17-M$_{\odot}$ progenitor that explodes with $\sim$10$^{51}$ erg of energy and $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni ejecta. The early explosion is highly asymmetric, expanding most prominently along the southern hemisphere. This early asymmetry is preserved to shock breakout, $\sim$1 day later. Breakout itself evinces strong angle-dependence, with as much a day delay in shock breakout by direction. The nickel ejecta closely tails the forward shock, with velocities at breakout as high as $\sim$7000 km s$^{-1}$. A delayed reverse shock forming at the H/He interface on hour timescales leads to the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, fast-moving nickel bullets, and almost complete mixing of the metal core into the hydrogen envelope. For the first time, we illustrate the angle-dependent emergent broadband and bolometric light curves from simulations evolved in three-dimensions in entirety, continuing through hydrodynamic shock breakout a CCSN model of a massive stellar progenitor evolved with detailed, late-time neutrino microphysics and transport. Our case study of a single progenitor suggests that 3D simulations initiated with detailed neutrino heating can begin to generically produce the cornucopia of suggested asymmetries and features in CCSNe observations, while establishing the methodology to study this problem in breadth.</description>

      <title>The Temporal Variability of Galactic VHE CRs and Multi-TeV Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) framework to model the Galactic CR distributions and associated non-thermal diffuse emissions up to PeV energies. We consider ensembles of discrete, finite lifetime CR sources, e.g.\ supernova remnants (SNRs), for a range of creation rates and lifetimes. We find that global properties of the CR sources are likely not directly recoverable from the current `snapshot' of the historic injection and propagation of CRs within the Galaxy that are provided by the data. We show that models for the diffuse $\gamma$ rays based on the discrete/time-dependent scenarios we consider are able to explain LHAASO very-/ultra-high energy (VHE/UHE) $\gamma$-ray data with up to 50\% contribution by unresolved leptonic sources at the highest energies. Over the models that we consider, variations in the diffuse VHE emissions can be $\sim$25\%, which is comparable to those for steady-state models that we investigated in earlier work. Such variations due to the discrete/finite nature of the CR sources are an important factor that are necessary to construct accurate physical models of the diffuse emissions from the Galaxy at VHE/UHEs.</description>

      <title>Evolution of X-ray and optical rapid variability during the low/hard state in the 2018 outburst of MAXI J1820+070 = ASASSN-18ey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed shot analyses of X-ray and optical sub-second flares observed during the low/hard state of the 2018 outburst in MAXI J1820$+$070. Optical shots were less spread than X-ray shots. The amplitude of X-ray shots was the highest at the onset of the outburst, and they faded at the transition to the intermediate state. The timescale of shots was $\sim$0.2 s, and we detected the abrupt spectral hardening synchronized with this steep flaring event. The time evolution of optical shots was not similar to that of X-ray shots. These results suggest that accreting gas blobs triggered a series of magnetic reconnections at the hot inner accretion flow in the vicinity of the black hole, which enhanced X-ray emission and generated flaring events. The rapid X-ray spectral hardening would be caused by this kind of magnetic activity. Also, the synchrotron emission not only at the hot flow but also at the jet plasma would contribute to the optical rapid variability. We also found that the low/hard state exhibited six different phases in the hardness-intensity diagram and the correlation plot between the optical flux and the X-ray hardness. The amplitude and duration of X-ray shots varied in synchrony with these phases. This time variation may provide key information about the evolution of the hot flow, the low-temperature outer disk, and the jet-emitting plasma.</description>

      <title>PMN J1310-5552: A Gamma-ray Emitting Blazar Candidate Harboring A Cosmic Monster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets manifest some of the most intriguing activities in the nuclear regions of active galaxies. Identifying the most powerful relativistic jets permits us to probe the most luminous accretion systems and, in turn, the most massive black holes. This paper reports the identification of one such object, PMN J1310$-$5552 ($z=1.56$), a blazar candidate of uncertain type detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope. The detection of broad emission lines in its optical spectra taken with the X-Shooter and Goodman spectrographs classifies it to be a flat-spectrum radio quasar. The analysis of the Goodman optical spectrum has revealed PMN J1310$-$5552 harbors a massive black hole (log scale $M_{\rm BH}=9.90\pm0.07$, in $M_{\odot}$) and luminous accretion disk (log scale $L_{\rm disk}=46.86\pm0.03$, in erg s$^{-1}$). The fitting of the observed big blue bump with the standard accretion disk model resulted in the log scale $M_{\rm BH}=9.81^{+0.19}_{-0.20}$ (in $M_{\odot}$) and $L_{\rm disk}=46.86^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$ (in erg s$^{-1}$), respectively. These parameters suggest PMN J1310$-$5552 hosts one of the most massive black holes and the most luminous accretion disks among the blazar population. The physical properties of this enigmatic blazar were studied by modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution considering the data from NuSTAR, Swift, Fermi-LAT, and archival observations. Overall, PMN J1310$-$5552 is a powerful `MeV' blazar with physical parameters similar to other members of this unique class of blazars. These results provide glimpses of monsters lurking among the unknown high-energy emitters and demonstrate the importance of ongoing wide-field sky surveys to discover them.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic energy of solid binary ionic mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electrostatic energy of binary ionic mixtures (BIMs) in the form of Coulomb crystals with the main focus on ordered crystals. We consider 15 different binary bcc-like lattices, accurately calculate their electrostatic energies and approximate them by a unified equation. These results extend those available in the literature. A detailed comparison with selected previous results is made, particularly, using previous calculations in the linear mixing rule approximation. The case of disordered BIMs is also outlined. The results are expected to be useful for exploring multi-component Coulomb systems in compact stars, laboratory plasmas, and technological applications.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents a theoretical model describing the full power spectra of synchrotron radiation generated by relativistic electrons in a turbulent magnetic field. Using the theoretical model, numerical calculations of the complete power spectra of synchrotron radiation were performed for a turbulent field generated by the harmonic method. Additionally, a model sky map was constructed, demonstrating the structure of the spatial inhomogeneity of the synchrotron radiation power distribution as seen by an observer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of Type I X-ray bursts is attributed to those seen by the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite (ANS) in September 1975 from the globular cluster NGC6624 containing the X-ray source 4U1820-303. I revisit these X-ray bursts, by re-analysing data from the Soft X-ray Experiment (SXX) onboard ANS, which were stored on microfiche. Earlier accounts of X-ray bursts had been reported; the first Type I X-ray burst recorded is the one observed by Vela 5B from Cen X-4 in July 1969.</description>

Abstract: Interacting supernovae provide key insights into the mass-loss processes of massive stars and their circumstellar environments. By analyzing their photometric and spectroscopic properties, we can study the complex interactions between ejected material and circumstellar material (CSM). This paper highlights the diversity of interacting SNe, including Types IIn, Ibn, and Icn, and explores the challenges in understanding progenitor systems, CSM structures, and late-time evolution. Advances in high-cadence observations and modeling are crucial for improving our knowledge of these stellar explosions.</description>

Abstract: A revised catalogue of 310 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) is presented, along with some statistics of their properties. 21 SNRs have been added to the catalogue since the previous published version from 2019, and 5 entries have been removed, as they have been identified as HII regions. Also discussed are some basics statistics of the remnants in the catalogue, the selection effects that apply to the identification of Galactic SNRs and their consequences.</description>

      <title>Constraining accretion physics with gravitational waves from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of eccentric, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) immersed in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei. We find that single gravitational-wave observations from these systems could provide measurements with ~ 10 % relative precision of, simultaneously, the disk viscosity and mass accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole. This is possible when the EMRI transitions, within the observation time, from supersonic to subsonic motion relative to the disk gas, for eccentricities e &gt; ~ 0.025-0.1. The estimate of the accretion rate would assist in the identification of the EMRI's host galaxy, or the observation of a direct electromagnetic counterpart, improving the chances of using these sources as cosmological sirens. Our work highlights the rich phenomenology of binary evolution in astrophysical environments and the need to improve the modelling and analysis of these systems for future gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Kilogauss magnetic field and jet dynamics in the quasar NRAO 530</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of the Event Horizon Telescope has enabled the study of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei down to sub-parsec linear scales even at high redshift. Quasi-simultaneous multifrequency observations provide insights into the physical conditions in compact regions and allow testing accretion theories. Initially we aimed at measuring the magnetic field strength close to the central supermassive black hole in NRAO 530 (1730-130) by studying frequency-dependent opacity of the jet matter, Faraday rotation and the spectral index in the mm-radio bands. NRAO 530 was observed quasi-simultaneously at 15, 22, 43, 86, and 227 GHz at four different very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) networks. By the means of imaging and model-fitting, we aligned the images, taken at different frequencies. We explored opacity along the jet and distribution of the linearly polarized emission in it. Our findings reveal that the jet of NRAO 530 at 86 and 227 GHz is transparent down to its origin, with 70 mJy emission detected at 227 GHz potentially originating from the accretion disk. The magnetic field strength near the black hole, estimated at $5r_\mathrm{g}$, is $3\times10^3-3\times10^4$ G (depending on the central black hole mass). These values represent some of the highest magnetic field strengths reported for active galaxies. We also report the first ever VLBI measurement of the Faraday rotation at 43-227 GHz, which reveals rotation measure values as high as -48000 rad/m2 consistent with higher particle density and stronger magnetic fields at the jet's outset. The complex shape of the jet in NRAO 530 is in line with the expected behavior of a precessing jet, with a period estimated to be around $6\pm4$~years.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of uniform rotation on the structure of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by recent laboratory experiments and astronomical observations, significant advances have deepened our understanding of neutron-star physics. NICER's Pulse Profile Modeling has refined our knowledge of neutron star masses and radii, while gravitational-wave detections have revealed key insights into the structure of neutron stars. Particularly relevant is the extraction of the tidal deformability by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration and the most recent determination of stellar radii by NICER, both suggesting a relatively soft equation of state (EOS) at intermediate densities. Additionally, measurements from the PREX collaboration and from pulsar timing suggest instead that the EOS is stiff in the vicinity of saturation density and at the highest densities accessible to date. But how stiff can the EOS be at these very high densities? Recent events featuring compact objects near the "lower mass gap" have raised questions about the existence of very massive neutron stars. Motivated by this finding and in light of new refinements to theoretical models, we explore the possibility that these massive objects may indeed be rapidly rotating neutron stars. We explore how rotation affects both the maximum neutron star mass and their associated radii, and discuss the implications they may have on the equation of state.</description>

      <title>AM$^3$: An Open-Source Tool for Time-Dependent Lepto-Hadronic Modeling of Astrophysical Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the AM$^3$ ("Astrophysical Multi-Messenger Modeling") software. AM$^3$ is a documented open source software that efficiently solves the coupled integro-differential equations describing the temporal evolution of the spectral densities of particles interacting in astrophysical environments, in-cluding photons, electrons, positrons, protons, neutrons, pions, muons, and neutrinos. The software has been extensively used to simulate the multi-wavelength and neutrino emission from active galactic nuclei (including blazars), gamma-ray bursts, and tidal disruption events. The simulations include all relevant non-thermal processes, namely synchrotron emission, inverse Compton scattering, photon-photon annihilation, proton-proton and proton-photon pion production, and photo-pair production. The software self-consistently calculates the full cascade of primary and secondary particles, including non-linear feedback processes and predictions in the time domain. It also allows to track separately the particle densities produced by means of each distinct interaction processes, including the different hadronic channels. With its efficient hybrid solver combining analytical and numerical techniques, AM$^3$ combines efficiency and accuracy at a user-adjustable level. We describe the technical details of the numerical framework and present three examples of applications to different astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choked jets (CJ) have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic (EM) signatures is crucial. A CJ source is expected harbouring in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with extended H envelopes, releasing ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission for a few days. The UV band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the CJ visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources (sample of observed Type II SNe enlarged by 60%). As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic/photohadronic interactions in CJ, we investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with EM signals coming from shock breakout (SBO) events. For optimized multimessenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at SBO (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after. Fewer than 1% of the CCSNe from red supergiant stars detectable with ULTRASAT might host a CJ and release TeV neutrinos. EM and neutrino detections, if accompanied by photometric and spectroscopic follow-up with evidence for a relativistic jet launched by the central engine, would suggest CCSNe harbouring choked jets as main contributors to the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>The Pulsar Science Collaboratory: Multi-Epoch Scintillation Studies of Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on findings from scintillation analyses using high-cadence observations of eight canonical pulsars with observing baselines ranging from one to three years. We obtain scintillation bandwidth and timescale measurements for all pulsars in our survey, scintillation arc curvature measurements for four, and detect multiple arcs for two. We find evidence of a previously undocumented scattering screen along the line of sight (LOS) to PSR J1645$-$0317, as well as evidence that a scattering screen along the LOS to PSR J2313$+$4253 may reside somewhere within the Milky Way's Orion-Cygnus arm. We report evidence of a significant change in the scintillation pattern in PSR J2022$+$5154 from the previous two decades of literature, wherein both the scintillation bandwidth and timescale decreased by an order of magnitude relative to earlier observations at the same frequencies, potentially as a result of a different screen dominating the observed scattering. By augmenting the results of previous studies, we find general agreement with estimations of scattering delays from pulsar observations and predictions by the NE2001 electron density model but not for the newest data we have collected, providing some evidence of changes in the ISM along various LOSs over the timespans considered. In a similar manner, we find additional evidence of a correlation between a pulsar's dispersion measure and the overall variability of its scattering delays over time. The plethora of interesting science obtained through these observations demonstrates the capabilities of the Green Bank Observatory's 20m telescope to contribute to pulsar-based studies of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cascade V4: A Semi-Analytical Code for Modeling Cosmological Gamma-Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing Monte Carlo electromagnetic transport models, finding good agreement within EBL uncertainties.</description>

      <title>FRB 20121102A monitoring: updated periodicity at L-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FRB 20121102A was the first fast radio burst to be observed to repeat. Since then, thousands of bursts have been detected by multiple radio telescopes around the world. Previous work has shown an indication of a cyclic activity level with a periodicity around 160 days. Knowing when the source repeats is essential for planning multi-wavelength monitoring to constrain their emission extend and progenitor source. We report the monitoring of FRB 20121102A using the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope at L-band and update the periodicity of the cyclic activity-level. We use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram on a sample of 284 observing epochs where 42% correspond to detections and 58% to non-detections. Our dataset is composed of the 7 epochs of our monitoring plus publicly available data. We investigate two methods, i) binary model, describing the observing epochs with 1 if there are detections and with 0 for non-detections. ii) normalised rates model: which considers the inferred detections rates. We report no detections in 12.5-hour observations down to a fluence of 0.29 Jy ms. The best period found for the cyclic activity window is $159.3 \pm 0.8$ days for the binary model and $159.3 \pm 0.3$ days for the normalised rates model. The activity phase is shown to be 53%. The normalised rates shows a clear Gaussian-like behaviour for the activity level, where the number of detections peak at the centre of the activity window. The periodicity found through both methods is consistent for the L and S-band datasets implying it is intrinsic to the source. The activity phase in S-band however shows an indication of it ending before the L-band activity phase, supporting the idea of chromatic dependence of the activity window. The sample at C-band however is not large enough to further confirm this result.</description>

      <title>The thermal emission in short GRBs with extended emission observed by Fermi/GBM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) with extended emission (EE) are composed of initial main emission (ME) with a short-hard spike, followed by a long-lasting EE. Whether the ME and EE originated from the same origin or not, as well as the jet composition, remains an open question. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of 36 gamma ray bursts (GRBs) in our sample, which are identified as the category of SGRBs with EE as observed by Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. By extracting time-integrated spectra of ME and EE with cutoff power-law or Band models for our sample, we find that 20 out of 36 SGRBs have $\alpha$ values that exceed the death line (e.g., -2/3) of synchrotron emission within either ME or EE phases, and we suggest that the quasi-thermal component should exist in the prompt emission. Then, we extract the time-resolved spectra of our samples, but only four GRBs are bright enough to extract the time-resolved spectra. We find that both thermal and nonthermal emissions do exist in the prompt emission of those four bright GRBs, which suggests that a hybrid jet (e.g., matter and Poynting-flux outflow) in GRBs should exist. Moreover, strong positive correlations (e.g., $F_{\rm tot}-\Gamma$ and $F_{\rm tot}-kT$) in the time-resolved spectra of ME and EE for those four GRBs have been discovered. This indicates that the spectral evolution of both ME and EE seem to share similar behavior, possibly from the same physical origin.</description>

      <title>Explaining Non-Merger Gamma-Ray Bursts and Broad-Lined Supernovae with Close Binary Progenitors with Black Hole Central Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over 25 years, the origin of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been linked to the collapse of rotating massive stars. However, we have yet to pinpoint the stellar progenitor powering these transients. Moreover, the dominant engine powering the explosions remains open to debate. Observations of both lGRBs, supernovae associated with these GRBs, such as broad-line (BL) stripped-envelope (type Ic) supernovae (hereafter, Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) and perhaps superluminous SNe, fast blue optical transients, and fast x-ray transients, may provide clues to both engines and progenitors. In this paper, we conduct a detailed study of the tight-binary formation scenario for lGRBs, comparing this scenario to other leading progenitor models. Combining this progenitor scenario with different lGRB engines, we can compare to existing data and make predictions for future observational tests. We find that the combination of the tight-binary progenitor scenario with the black hole accretion disk (BHAD) engine can explain lGRBs, low-luminosity GRBs, ultra-long GRBs, and Ic-BL. We discuss the various progenitor properties required for these different subclasses and note such systems would be future gravitational wave merger sources. We show that the current literature on other progenitor-engine scenarios cannot explain all of these transient classes with a single origin, motivating additional work. We find that the tight-binary progenitor with a magnetar engine is excluded by existing observations. The observations can be used to constrain the properties of stellar evolution, the nature of the GRB and the associated SN engines in lGRBs and Ic-BL. We discuss the future observations needed to constrain our understanding of these rare, but powerful, explosions.</description>

      <title>Detection of two TeV gamma-ray outbursts from NGC 1275 by LHAASO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) is one of the components of Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and can monitor any sources over two-thirds of the sky for up to 7 hours per day with &gt;98\% duty cycle. In this work, we report the detection of two outbursts of the Fanaroff-Riley I radio galaxy NGC 1275 that were detected by LHAASO-WCDA between November 2022 and January 2023 with statistical significance of 5.2~$\sigma$ and 8.3~$\sigma$. The observed spectral energy distribution in the range from 500 GeV to 3 TeV is fitted by a power-law with a best-fit spectral index of $\alpha=-3.37\pm0.52$ and $-3.35\pm0.29$, respectively. The outburst flux above 0.5~TeV was ($4.55\pm 4.21)\times~10^{-11}~\rm cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$ and ($3.45\pm 1.78)\times~10^{-11}~\rm cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$, corresponding to 60\%, 45\% of Crab Nebula flux. Variation analysis reveals the variability time-scale of days at the TeV energy band. A simple test by one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model reproduces the data in the gamma-ray band well.</description>

      <title>Supernova Shocks Cannot Explain the Inflated State of Hypervelocity Runaways from White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have found a growing number of hypervelocity stars with speeds of $\approx 1500-2500\,$km\,s$^{-1}$ which could have only been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Most of the observed hypervelocity runaways in this class display a surprising inflated structure: their current radii are roughly an order of magnitude greater than they would have been as white dwarfs filling their Roche lobe. While many simulations exist studying the dynamical phase leading to supernova detonation in these systems, no detailed calculations of the long-term structure of the runaways have yet been performed. We use an existing \textsc{Arepo} hydrodynamical simulation of a supernova in a white dwarf binary as a starting point for the evolution of these stars with the 1 dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We show that the supernova shock is not enough to inflate the white dwarf over timescales longer than a few thousand years, significantly shorter than the $10^{5-6}$ year lifetimes inferred for observed hypervelocity runaways. Despite experiencing a shock from a supernova less than $\approx 0.02\,R_\odot$ away, our models do not experience significant interior heating, and all contract back to radii around $0.01\,R_\odot$ within about $10^4$\,years. Explaining the observed inflated states requires either an additional source of significant heating or some other physics that is not yet accounted for in the subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Dark matter limits from the tip of the red giant branch of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Direct Collapse Accretion Disks Within Dark Matter Halos: Saturation of the Magnetorotational Instability and the Field Expulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have used high-resolution zoom-in simulations of direct collapse to supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds within dark mater (DM) halos in the presence of magnetic fields generated during the collapse, down to $10^{-5}$ pc or 2 AU. We confirm an efficient amplification of magnetic field during collapse, the formation of a geometrically thick self-gravitating accretion disk inside 0.1 pc, and damping of fragmentation in the disk by the field. This disk differs profoundly from SMBH accretion disks. We find the following: (1) The accretion disk is subject to the magnetorotational instability which further amplifies the field to near equipartition. No artificial seeding of the disk field has been used. (2) The equipartition toroidal field changes its polarity in the midplane. (3) The nonlinear Parker instability develops, accompanied by the vertical buckling of the field lines, which injects material above the disk, leading to an increase in the disk scale height; (4) With the Coriolis force producing a coherent helicity above the disk, vertical poloidal field has been generated and amplified. (5) We estimate that the associated outflow will be most probably squashed by accretion. The resulting configuration consists of a magnetized disk with $\beta &gt; 0.1$ and its magnetosphere with $\beta &lt;&lt; 1$, where $\beta = P_{\rm th}/P_{\rm B}$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy density. (6) The disk is highly variable, due to feeding by variable accretion flow, and strong vortical motions are present. (7) Finally, the negative gradient of the total vertical stress drives an equatorial outflow sandwiched by an inward accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Windy Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>
