      <title>Observation of Coherent Perfect Acoustic Absorption at an Exceptional Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have recently shown new possibilities to manipulate wave scattering by exploiting loss, yet coherent perfect absorption at an exceptional point (CPA EP) remains elusive in acoustics. Here we demonstrate it based on a two-channel waveguide with compact lossy resonators. We realize imbalanced losses crucial for CPA EP by using active components to independently modulate the non-Hermiticity. The CPA EP experimentally manifests as full absorption at a unique real frequency and shows high sensitivity to the incident phase variations.Our findings open an avenue to explore novel non-Hermitian physics for classical waves and develop innovative acoustic singularity-based devices.</description>

      <title>Hybrid TPMS-based Designs for Anisotropic Acoustic Metamaterials: Numerical Simulation and Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic acoustic metamaterials have received significant scholarly attention in recent years due to their capacity to manipulate wave propagation across various directions. This property is integral to applications involving directional wave guiding. Nonetheless, previously proposed anisotropic acoustic metamaterials exhibited commonalities in bandgaps along x and y periodicities, limiting their efficacy for such applications. Therefore, this work introduces hybrid Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMSs)-based anisotropic acoustic metamaterials that manifest abundant bandgap and passband characteristics along the x and y periodicities. Four design families were considered: Primitive-Primitive sheet-based, Gyroid-Gyroid sheet-based, Diamond-Diamond sheet-based, and Nevious-Nevious sheet-based. A computationally efficient exhaustive search was employed to identify optimal hybrid metamaterial designs for various desired audible frequency ranges (i.e., ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz). In total, 392,178 designs were assessed in this search. The optimal designs demonstrated pronounced bandgap and passband characteristics across both periodicities, thereby positioning them as promising candidates for directional wave guiding applications. For instance, the optimal Nevious-Nevious sheet-based unit cell design achieved a minimum coverage of 62.90% for bandgaps and passbands within the frequency range of 20 Hz to 5 kHz. Following the identification of optimal unit cell designs, the acoustic pressure responses of hybrid anisotropic acoustic metamaterials, constructed from repeated optimal unit cells, were computed. This involved considering two actuation scenarios, which pertain to exciting the system along both x and y periodicities, revealing responses in alignment with optimized band characteristics.</description>

      <title>Analog dual classifier via a time-modulated neuromorphic metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neuromorphic metasurface embodies mechanical intelligence by realizing physical neural architectures. It exploits guided wave scattering to conduct computations in an analog manner. Through multiple tuned waveguides, the neuromorphic system recognizes the features of an input signal and self-identifies its classification label. The computational input is introduced to the system through mechanical excitations at one edge, generating elastic waves which traverse multiple layers of resonant metasurfaces. These metasurfaces possess a tunable phase akin to trainable parameters in deep learning algorithms. While early efforts have been promising, the well-established constraints on wave propagation in finite media limit such systems to single-task realizations. In this work, we devise a dual classifier neuromorphic metasurface and demonstrate its effectiveness in carrying out two completely independent classification problems, which are concurrently carried out in parallel, thus addressing a major bottleneck in physical computing systems. Parallelization is achieved through smart multiplexing of the carrier computational frequency, enabled by prescribed temporal modulations of the embedded waveguides. The presented theory and results pave the way for new paradigms in wave-based computing systems which have been elusive thus far.</description>

      <title>Thermal Property Microscopy with Compressive Sensing Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial mapping of thermal properties is critical for unveiling the structure-property relation of materials, heterogeneous interfaces, and devices. These property images can also serve as datasets for training artificial intelligence models for material discoveries and optimization. Here we introduce a high-throughput thermal property imaging method called compressive sensing frequency domain thermoreflectance (CS-FDTR), which can robustly profile thermal property distributions with micrometer resolutions while requiring only a random subset of pixels being experimentally measured. The high-resolution thermal property image is reconstructed from the raw down-sampled data through L_1-regularized minimization. The high-throughput imaging capability of CS-FDTR is validated using the following cases: (a) the thermal conductance of a patterned heterogeneous interface, (b) thermal conductivity variations of an annealed pyrolytic graphite sample, and (c) the sharp change in thermal conductivity across a vertical aluminum/graphite interface. With less than half of the pixels being experimentally sampled, the thermal property images measured using CS-FDTR show nice agreements with the ground truth (point-by-point scanning), with a relative deviation below 15%. This work opens the possibility of high-throughput thermal property imaging without sacrificing the data quality, which is critical for materials discovery and screening.</description>

      <title>Harnessing curvature for helical wave generation in spiral-based metamaterial structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearly polarized elastic waves propagating in a linear path have been extensively explored in numerous applications from biomedical imaging to structural health monitoring. However, elastic waves propagating in a circularly polarized helical path are less explored because of the challenges in their generation and control. In this paper, we harness conventional actuation methods combined with sheets decorated by Archimedean spirals to generate elastic helical waves. We show that our metamaterials can support the propagation of such waves along a curved path without backscattering in a topologically protected manner. Moreover, we also show the creation and propagation of helical waves in our metamaterials without the need to wave guiding or domain interfaces, all with a single mode excitation source. We establish our methodology for flat plates and show the wave evolution as the metamaterials transition from slightly curved plates to fully curved cylinders. We observe the preservation of topologically protected edge states and helical wave beaming at different frequencies without the need to domain interferences. Furthermore, we leverage the mode to tune the helicity of the propagating waves. Our methodology can open new avenues for the generation and control of elastic helical waves using single source actuation that can be used in numerous applications.</description>

      <title>Complexity in the Wake of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate quantitatively, albeit in arbitrary units, the evolution of complexity of the human system since the domestication of fire. This is made possible by studying the timing of the 14 most important milestones, breaks in historical perspective, in the evolution of humans. AI is considered here as the latest such milestone with importance comparable to that of the Internet. The complexity is modeled to have evolved along a bell-shaped curve, reaching a maximum around our times, and soon entering a declining trajectory. According to this curve, the next evolutionary milestone of comparable importance is expected around 2050 and should add less complexity than AI but more than the milestone grouping together nuclear energy, DNA, and the transistor. The peak of the complexity curve coincides squarely with the life span of the baby boomers. The peak in the rate of growth of the world population precedes the complexity peak by 25 years, which is about the time it takes a young man or woman before they are able to add complexity to the human system in a significant way. It is in society's interest to flatten the complexity bell-shaped curve to whatever extent this is possible in order enjoy complexity longer.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Ultrafast Thermal Metamaterial Pixel Arrays by Dual-Gate Graphene Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal signatures represent ubiquitous infrared appearances of objects, carrying their unique spectral fingerprints. Despite extensive efforts to decipher and manipulate thermal-infrared signals, the ability to fully control them across spatial, temporal and spectral domains remains a significant challenge due to the slow speed, diffuse and broadband emitting nature of thermal emission in most materials. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable ultrafast thermal metamaterial pixel array that integrates active metasurfaces with dual-gate graphene transistors (Gr-FETs). The Gr-FETs with dual-gate control in each pixel achieve the heater-switch dual functionalities. As broadband transparent microheaters, Gr-FETs support the arbitrary design of integrated metasurfaces to achieve multi-color, narrowband infrared emission and operate at ultrafast modulation speeds. Concurrently as electrical switches, they enable a unified control scheme for pixel arrays of various sizes over large areas without compromising emission intensity. By decoupling the thermal generation and emission design processes, our approach provides an unprecedented degree of flexibility in programming thermal output across space, time, and wavelength. Our fabricated thermal pixel array experimentally demonstrated 26 alphabetical letters by applying progressive scanning, thus paving the way for practical realization of universal thermal signature controls for advanced thermal-infrared applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable Epsilon Near Zero Metamaterial with Rotating Obround-Shaped Meta-Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new design of a microwave-range ENZ metamaterial consisting of rods with an obround cross-section is proposed. The plasma frequency of the metamaterial can be tuned by rotating the constituent meta-atoms. Tunability of the plasma frequency by 26% is demonstrated both experimentally and numerically. The observed tuning range is dramatically higher than in the one observed in natural materials at optical range.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Metallicity in {\AA}ngstr\"om-Thickness 2D Bismuth and Layer-Selective Ohmic Contact to MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metallic bismuth (Bi) via van der Waals (vdW) squeezing method opens a new avenue to ultrascaling metallic materials into the {\aa}ngstr\"om-thickness regime [Nature 639, 354 (2025)]. However, freestanding 2D Bi is typically known to exhibit a semiconducting phase [Nature 617, 67 (2023), Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 236801 (2023)], which contradicts with the experimentally observed metallicity in vdW-squeezed 2D Bi. Here we show that such discrepancy originates from the pressure-induced buckled-to-flat structural transition in 2D Bi, which changes the electronic structure from semiconducting to metallic phases. Based on the experimentally fabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of layer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to the sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky barrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2 monolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling charge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers. The layer-selective Ohmic contact proposed here represents a layertronic generalization of metal/semiconductor contact, paving a way towards layertronic device application.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional materials as ideal substrates for molecular quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is central to quantum technologies. Color centers in insulators have been extensively studied for single-photon generation, but organic molecules immobilized on substrates have gained attention due to their superior scalability, large oscillator strengths, and tunable emission frequency. Here, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the photoemission from organic molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. Focusing on terrylene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we obtain zero phonon line (ZPL) energies and emission lineshapes in excellent agreement with experiments. Notably, antisite defects in hBN can immobilize the molecule without influencing its key emission features. We further show that the main effect of the 2D substrate is to introduce sharp sidebands near the ZPL as a fingerprint of hindered rotational, translational, or bending modes of the molecule. Our findings provide insight into how substrate interactions shape the optical properties of molecular systems for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a platform to achieve ultra-strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here we leverage dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO2 layer. The strong out-of-plane electric fields in our tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of 0.101 and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four- to five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of our approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low-energy optical modulators.</description>
