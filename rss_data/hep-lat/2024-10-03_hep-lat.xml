      <title>Natural Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a large class of chiral gauge theories in four dimensions it was found that certain natural assumption about the bifermion condensates leads to the infrared effective theory where the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions are satisfied in an entirely evident fashion, without need of verifying arithmetic equations. This is due to the fact that in these systems, characterized by dynamical color (and flavor) symmetry breaking, the quantum numbers and multiplicities of the low-energy massless fermions match exactly those of the fermions in the UV theory which do not condense and remain massless, with respect to the unbroken symmetries. This means also that the stronger constraints following from the matching request of mixed anomalies involving certain generalized 1-form center symmetries, as well as some global anomalies such as Witten's $SU(2)$ anomaly, are all fully satisfied. It is the aim of this note to clarify better the working of this phenomenon (which we call Natural Anomaly Matching), correct some earlier statements made about it, and illustrate it further with a few new examples.</description>

      <title>QCD field-strength correlators on a Polyakov loop with gradient flow at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Momentum exchange between a heavy quark and a hot quark-gluon medium can be characterized nonperturbatively in terms of field-strength field-strength (E-E and B-B) correlators along a Polyakov loop. These can be studied on the lattice and analytically continued. However the lattice typically determines the correlators after the application of gradient flow. We investigate how gradient flow renormalizes these correlation functions by carrying out a next-to-leading order perturbative analysis of the correlators including gradient flow. This establishes a next-to-leading order renormalization matching between the correlators as measured on the lattice and the correlators relevant for momentum diffusion.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decay of the triply heavy $\Omega_{ccb}$ to the observed $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the weak semileptonic decay of the $ \Omega^{+}_{ccb} \rightarrow \Xi^{++}_{cc} ~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$, where a triply heavy baryon with spin 1/2 decays into the observed doubly heavy baryon with spin 1/2, using QCD sum rule method in all lepton channels. We compute the six relevant vector and axial vector form factors entering the low energy matrix elements in full theory. The invariant form factors are building blocks, using the fit faction of which in terms of $ q^2 $ in whole physical region, we calculate the exclusive widths in three lepton channels. Our predictions may help the present and future experiments in the course of their search for doubly and triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Moments of parton distribution functions of any order from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a procedure to determine moments of parton distribution functions of any order in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The procedure is based on the gradient flow for fermion and gauge fields. The flowed matrix elements of twist-2 operators renormalize multiplicatively, and the matching with the physical matrix elements can be obtained using continuum symmetries and the irreducible representations of Euclidean 4-dimensional rotations. We calculate the matching coefficients at one-loop in perturbation theory for moments of any order in the flavor nonsinglet case. We also give specific examples of operators that could be used in lattice QCD computations. It turns out that it is possible to choose operators with identical Lorentz indices and still have a multiplicative matching. One can thus use twist-2 operators exclusively with temporal indices, thus substantially improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the computation of the hadronic matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Strangeness-Correlations on the pseudo-critical line in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present some lattice QCD results on first ($\chi_1^i$) and second ($\chi_2^i$) cumulants of and correlations ($\chi_{11}^{ij}$) among net baryon-number ($B$), strangeness ($S$) and electric charge ($Q$) along the pseudo-critical line ($T_{pc}(\mu_B)$) in the temperature ($T$)--baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) phase diagram of (2+1)-flavor QCD. We point out that violations of the isospin symmetric limit of vanishing electric charge chemical potential are small along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ for the entire range of $\mu_B$ covered in the RHIC beam energy scan. For the strangeness neutral matter produced in heavy-ion collisions this leads to a close relation between $\chi_{11}^{BS}$ and $\chi_{11}^{QS}$. We compare lattice QCD results for $\chi_{11}^{BS}/\chi_2^S$ along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ line with preliminary experimental measurements of $\chi_{11}^{BS}/\chi_2^S$ for collision energies $7.7~{\rm GeV}\le \sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\le 62.4~{\rm GeV}$. While we find good agreements for $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\ge 39$~GeV, differences are sizeable at smaller values of $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$. Moreover, we compare lattice QCD results for the ratio of the strangeness ($\mu_S$) to baryon ($\mu_B$) chemical potentials, which define a strangeness neutral system with fixed electric charge to baryon number density, with experimental results obtained by the STAR collaboration for $\mu_S/\mu_B$ using strange baryon yields on the freeze-out line. Finally, we determine the baryon chemical potential at the freeze-out ($\mu_B^f$) by comparing $\chi_1^B/\chi_2^B$ along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ with the experimentally measured net-proton cumulants $\chi_1^p/\chi_2^p$. We find that $\{\mu_B^f, T_{pc}(\mu_B^f) \}$ are consistent with the freeze-out parameters of the statistical-model fits to experimentally measured hadron yields for $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} \geq 11.5$ GeV.</description>
