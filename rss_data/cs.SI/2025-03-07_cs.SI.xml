      <title>Research on evolution and early warning model of network public opinion based on online Latent Dirichlet distribution model and BP neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online public opinion is increasingly becoming a significant factor affecting the stability of the internet and society, particularly as the frequency of online public opinion crises has risen in recent years. Enhancing the capability for early warning of online public opinion crises is urgent. The most effective approach is to identify potential crises in their early stages and implement corresponding management measures. This study establishes a preliminary indicator system for online public opinion early warning, based on the principles of indicator system construction and the characteristics and evolution patterns of online public opinion. Subsequently, data-driven methodologies were employed to collect and preprocess public opinion indicator data. Utilizing grey relational analysis and the K-Means clustering algorithm, we classified online public opinion events into three levels: slight, warning, and severe. Furthermore, we constructed an online topic evolution model using the online Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model to analyze the thematic changes of online public opinion events across different warning levels. Finally, we developed an online public opinion early warning model using a Backpropagation (BP) neural network. The test results of early warning samples show that the model achieves high accuracy. Thus, in practical early warning applications, the BP neural network can be effectively utilized for predicting online public opinion events.</description>

      <title>BotUmc: An Uncertainty-Aware Twitter Bot Detection with Multi-view Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social bots have become widely known by users of social platforms. To prevent social bots from spreading harmful speech, many novel bot detections are proposed. However, with the evolution of social bots, detection methods struggle to give high-confidence answers for samples. This motivates us to quantify the uncertainty of the outputs, informing the confidence of the results. Therefore, we propose an uncertainty-aware bot detection method to inform the confidence and use the uncertainty score to pick a high-confidence decision from multiple views of a social network under different environments. Specifically, our proposed BotUmc uses LLM to extract information from tweets. Then, we construct a graph based on the extracted information, the original user information, and the user relationship and generate multiple views of the graph by causal interference. Lastly, an uncertainty loss is used to force the model to quantify the uncertainty of results and select the result with low uncertainty in one view as the final decision. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Unseen Fake News Detection Through Casual Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media poses significant risks, necessitating timely and accurate detection. However, existing methods struggle with unseen news due to their reliance on training data from past events and domains, leaving the challenge of detecting novel fake news largely unresolved. To address this, we identify biases in training data tied to specific domains and propose a debiasing solution FNDCD. Originating from causal analysis, FNDCD employs a reweighting strategy based on classification confidence and propagation structure regularization to reduce the influence of domain-specific biases, enhancing the detection of unseen fake news. Experiments on real-world datasets with non-overlapping news domains demonstrate FNDCD's effectiveness in improving generalization across domains.</description>

      <title>SMTPD: A New Benchmark for Temporal Prediction of Social Media Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media popularity prediction task aims to predict the popularity of posts on social media platforms, which has a positive driving effect on application scenarios such as content optimization, digital marketing and online advertising. Though many studies have made significant progress, few of them pay much attention to the integration between popularity prediction with temporal alignment. In this paper, with exploring YouTube's multilingual and multi-modal content, we construct a new social media temporal popularity prediction benchmark, namely SMTPD, and suggest a baseline framework for temporal popularity prediction. Through data analysis and experiments, we verify that temporal alignment and early popularity play crucial roles in social media popularity prediction for not only deepening the understanding of temporal dynamics of popularity in social media but also offering a suggestion about developing more effective prediction models in this field. Code is available at https://github.com/zhuwei321/SMTPD.</description>

      <title>Applying Smarta to the analysis of tourist networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of the present study was the destination life cycle model, a classical model that describes the development of tourist destinations. We examined mass tourism in Benidorm based on tourist accommodation supply and demand statistics over the January 2016 - October 2018 period, provided by Spain's National Institute for Statistics. The objective was to analyze the life cycle and competitiveness of Benidorm's tourism system, interpret whether the tourism product was sustainable, and at what stage in the cycle Benidorm is currently in. To do this, we used Smarta software, which, based on network analysis, enables to interpret the system's virtuous cycles and analyze causality by observing relationship patterns in the system's attractors, thus complementing typical processing based on causal maps and the study of social networks. The results obtained by this application (which has been developed by our research team), show 6 sets of attractors that mark the trends of the tourist system. Finally, the analysis of the significant variables of these attractors have helped to justify that the tourist system of Benidorm is in the rejuvenation phase.</description>

      <title>Mapping bipartite networks into multidimensional hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite networks appear in many real-world contexts, linking entities across two distinct sets. They are often analyzed via one-mode projections, but such projections can introduce artificial correlations and inflated clustering, obscuring the true underlying structure. In this paper, we propose a geometric model for bipartite networks that leverages the high levels of bipartite four-cycles as a measure of clustering to place both node types in the same similarity space, where link probabilities decrease with distance. Additionally, we introduce B-Mercator, an algorithm that infers node positions from the bipartite structure. We evaluate its performance on diverse datasets, illustrating how the resulting embeddings improve downstream tasks such as node classification and distance-based link prediction in machine learning. These hyperbolic embeddings also enable the generation of synthetic networks with node features closely resembling real-world ones, thereby safeguarding sensitive information while allowing secure data sharing. In addition, we show how preserving bipartite structure avoids the pitfalls of projection-based techniques, yielding more accurate descriptions and better performance. Our method provides a robust framework for uncovering hidden geometry in complex bipartite systems.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Graph Filtering via Multimodal Feature Refinement for Extremely Fast Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems improve the performance of canonical recommender systems with no item features by utilizing diverse content types such as text, images, and videos, while alleviating inherent sparsity of user-item interactions and accelerating user engagement. However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To overcome this limitation, we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method based on the notion of graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs through nontrivial multimodal feature refinement such as robust scaling and vector shifting by addressing the heterogeneous characteristics across modalities. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses multimodal information using linear low-pass filters across different modalities. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 13.35% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</description>

      <title>Epidemic paradox induced by awareness driven network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stationary epidemic processes in scale-free networks with local awareness behavior adopted by only susceptible, only infected, or all nodes. We find that while the epidemic size in the susceptible-aware and the all-aware models scales linearly with the network size, the scaling becomes sublinear in the infected-aware model. Hence, fewer aware nodes may reduce the epidemic size more effectively; a phenomenon reminiscent of Braess's paradox. We present numerical and theoretical analysis, and highlight the role of influential nodes and their disassortativity to raise epidemic awareness.</description>

      <title>NodeNAS: Node-Specific Graph Neural Architecture Search for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural architecture search (GraphNAS) has demonstrated advantages in mitigating performance degradation of graph neural networks (GNNs) due to distribution shifts. Recent approaches introduce weight sharing across tailored architectures, generating unique GNN architectures for each graph end-to-end. However, existing GraphNAS methods do not account for distribution patterns across different graphs and heavily rely on extensive training data. With sparse or single training graphs, these methods struggle to discover optimal mappings between graphs and architectures, failing to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose node-specific graph neural architecture search(NodeNAS), which aims to tailor distinct aggregation methods for different nodes through disentangling node topology and graph distribution with limited datasets. We further propose adaptive aggregation attention based Multi-dim NodeNAS method(MNNAS), which learns an node-specific architecture customizer with good generalizability. Specifically, we extend the vertical depth of the search space, supporting simultaneous node-specific architecture customization across multiple dimensions. Moreover, we model the power-law distribution of node degrees under varying assortativity, encoding structure invariant information to guide architecture customization across each dimension. Extensive experiments across supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that MNNAS surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves excellent OOD generalization.</description>
