      <title>Exact spectral properties of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional lattices: Anomalous Fermi singularities and polaron quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the exact spectral function of a single impurity repulsively interacting with a bath of fermions in one-dimensional lattices, by deriving the explicit expression of the form factor for both regular Bethe states and the irregular spin-flip state and $\eta$-pairing state, based on the exactly solvable Lieb-Wu model. While at low impurity momentum $Q\sim0$ the spectral function is dominated by two power-law Fermi singularities, at large momentum we observe that the two singularities develop into two-sided distributions and eventually become anomalous Fermi singularities at the boundary of the Brillouin zone (i.e., $Q=\pm\pi$), with the power-law tails extending towards low energy. Near the quarter filling of the Fermi bath, we also find two broad polaron peaks at large impurity momentum, collectively contributed by many excited many-body states with non-negligible form factors. Our exact results of those distinct features in one-dimensional Fermi polarons, which have no correspondences in two and three dimensions, could be readily probed in cold-atom laboratories by trapping highly imbalanced two-component fermionic atoms into one-dimensional optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Polaron effect in waveguide quantum optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the quantized mechanical motion of optically trapped atoms, arranged in proximity to a one-dimensional waveguide, on the propagation of polariton modes. Our study identifies a regime of resonant phonon-assisted mixing between lower and upper polaritons, resulting in a pronounced polaron effect. This effect is characterized by the formation of new band gaps and the appearance of weakly dispersive states within the original polariton band gap. The polaron spectrum, which can be directly probed via resonant elastic scattering, provides novel opportunities for quantum optical applications. These findings open avenues for enhanced control in state-of-the-art waveguide quantum electrodynamics experiments with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Persistent breather and dynamical symmetry in a unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SO(2,1) dynamical symmetry makes a remarkable prediction that the breathing oscillation of a scale invariant quantum gas in an isotropic harmonic trap is isentropic and can persist indefinitely. In 2D, this symmetry is broken due to quantum anomaly in the strongly interacting range, and consequently the lifetime of the breathing mode becomes finite. The persistent breather in a strongly interacting system has so far not been realized. Here we experimentally achieve the long-lived breathing mode in a 3D unitary Fermi gas, which is protected by the SO(2,1) symmetry. The nearly perfect SO(2,1) symmetry is realized by loading the ultracold Fermi gas in an isotropic trap and tuning the interatomic interaction to resonance. The breathing mode oscillates at twice the trapping frequency even for large excitation amplitudes. The ratio of damping rate to oscillation frequency is as small as 0.002, providing an interacting persistent breather. The oscillation frequency and damping rate keep nearly constant for different atomic densities and temperatures, demonstrating the robustness of the SO(2,1) symmetry in 3D. The factors that lead to the residual damping have also been clarified. This work opens the way to study many-body non-equilibrium dynamics related to the dynamical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensate Vortices with Hypercylindrical Symmetry using Zeroth-order Dimensional Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate D-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a hypercylindrical trap with a vortex core along the z-axis and quantized circulation $\hbar m$. We analytically approximate the hypercylindrical Gross-Pitaevskii equation using dimensional perturbation theory, where the perturbation parameter is $\delta=1/(D+2|m|-3)$. We analyze lower effective dimensions due to trap anisotropy, and we compute properties of vortices in higher dimensions motivated by the study of synthetic dimensions, where additional dimensions can be simulated experimentally, and by holographic duality, where a higher-dimensional gravitational model corresponds to a lower-dimensional quantum model. We derive zeroth-order ($\delta \to 0$) semiclassical approximations for the condensate density, energy, chemical potential, and critical vortex rotation speed in arbitrary dimensions. In the zeroth-order approximation, we observe crossings between energy levels for different dimensions as a function of interaction strength and anisotropy parameters.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek scaling of the superfluid-supersolid transition in an elongated dipolar gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation, in comparison to the adiabatic case. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both, the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic potential immersed in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a modified three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevski equation that describes a static impurity in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Our focus is on the interplay between the shape of the impurity and the anisotropy of the medium manifested in the energy and the density of the system. Without external confinement, properties of the system are derived with basic analytical approaches. For a system in a harmonic trap, the model is investigated numerically, using the split-step Crank-Nicolson method. Our results demonstrate that the impurity would prefer to change its shape to accommodate the anisotropic character of the bath, in particular it would prefer to align itself with the direction of the dipoles. Our work complements studies of impurities in Bose gases with zero-range interactions, and paves the way for studies of dipolar polarons with a modified Gross-Pitaevski equation.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and Hyperuniformity in Quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard Models with and without Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of local superfluid amplitude and boson density. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a significant increase of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. The order metric clarifies if the distribution of a physical quantity reflects the point distribution or not, and quantifies how complex the distribution is in comparison with the point distribution. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear effects in the number-conserving analogue gravity of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates at absolute zero, and demonstrate that an analogue gravity model going beyond the standard linearized analogue gravity paradigm \`a la Unruh must take into account the backreaction of quasiparticle excitations onto the condensate background. This requires that one expands to second order in perturbation amplitude and thus takes the intrinsic nonlinearity of the theory into account. It is shown that, as a result, significant modifications of the standard paradigm occur. In particular, to obtain a fully Lorentz-covariant equation in curved spacetime for second-order perturbations, we demonstrate that it is necessary to introduce, to leading order in powers of the formal mean-field expansion parameter $N^{-1/2}$ (where $N$ is total particle number), a quantum-fluctuation-renormalized spacetime metric which substantially differs from the Unruh acoustic spacetime metric and, to subleading order $1/N$, two emergent vector fields and a mass term. Both the renormalized metric as well as the vector fields and the mass then keep track of the backreaction of the quasiparticles onto the condensate up to the order in powers of $N^{-1/2}$ considered. Finally, we apply our formalism to an analogue-cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and establish its renormalized form due to the quantum many-body backreaction exerted by the excitation cloud.</description>
