      <title>MonetGPT: Solving Puzzles Enhances MLLMs' Image Retouching Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives.

      <title>Anymate: A Dataset and Baselines for Learning 3D Object Rigging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigging and skinning are essential steps to create realistic 3D animations, often requiring significant expertise and manual effort. Traditional attempts at automating these processes rely heavily on geometric heuristics and often struggle with objects of complex geometry. Recent data-driven approaches show potential for better generality, but are often constrained by limited training data. We present the Anymate Dataset, a large-scale dataset of 230K 3D assets paired with expert-crafted rigging and skinning information -- 70 times larger than existing datasets. Using this dataset, we propose a learning-based auto-rigging framework with three sequential modules for joint, connectivity, and skinning weight prediction. We systematically design and experiment with various architectures as baselines for each module and conduct comprehensive evaluations on our dataset to compare their performance. Our models significantly outperform existing methods, providing a foundation for comparing future methods in automated rigging and skinning. Code and dataset can be found at https://anymate3d.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Designing 3D Anisotropic Frame Fields with Odeco Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method to synthesize a 3D tensor field within a constrained geometric domain represented as a tetrahedral mesh. Whereas previous techniques optimize for isotropic fields, we focus on anisotropic tensor fields that are smooth and aligned with the domain boundary or user guidance. The key ingredient of our method is a novel computational design framework, built on top of the symmetric orthogonally decomposable (odeco) tensor representation, to optimize the stretching ratios and orientations for each tensor in the domain. In contrast to past techniques designed only for isotropic tensors, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in generating smooth volumetric tensor fields with high anisotropy and shape conformity, especially for the domain with complex shapes. We apply these anisotropic tensor fields to various applications, such as anisotropic meshing, structural mechanics, and fabrication.</description>
