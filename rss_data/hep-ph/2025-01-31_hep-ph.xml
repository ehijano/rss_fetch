      <title>Dark matter in the scale-invariant 3-3-1-1 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scale-invariant model with the 3-3-1-1 gauge symmetry that features universal seesaw for all fermion masses. The discrete remnant of the gauge group, the matter parity, stabilizes a fermionic dark matter candidate. The scalar sector contains two triplets, the minimum number to break the 3-3-1 symmetry, and two scalar singlets. With the help of additional vector-like quarks, the universal implementation of the see-saw mechanism across all fermion sectors provides a partial explanation for the observed hierarchy of masses for charged leptons, neutrinos, and quarks. We identify the lightest $ P_M $-odd fermion, $ f_\mathrm{d} $, as a viable dark matter candidate. This fermion satisfies the relic density constraint and the spin-independent constraints within the mass range $ 160 \, \textrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{f_\mathrm{d}} \lesssim 520$ GeV . This range depends on the symmetry-breaking scale $ v_\chi $ with a lower bound $ v_\chi \gtrsim 3.6$ TeV due to LEP bounds on the $ \rho_0 $ parameter. Spin-independent scattering cross-sections for $ f_\mathrm{d} $ align with experimental limits from LZ and PandaX-4T, with some regions of the parameter space nearing the sensitivity of upcoming experiments, such as XLZD and PandaX-xT, which offers promising opportunities for detection.</description>

      <title>The Fermi function and the neutron's lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Fermi function ansatz for nuclear beta decay describes enhanced perturbative effects in the limit of large nuclear charge $Z$ and/or small electron velocity $\beta$. We define and compute the quantum field theory object that replaces this ansatz for neutron beta decay, where neither of these limits hold. We present a new factorization formula that applies in the limit of small electron mass, analyze the components of this formula through two loop order, and resum perturbative corrections that are enhanced by large logarithms. We apply our results to the neutron lifetime, supplying the first two-loop input to the long-distance corrections. Our result can be summarized as \begin{equation*}
  \tau_n \times |V_{ud}|^2\big[1+3\lambda^2\big]\big[1+\Delta_R\big]
  =
  \frac{5263.284(17)\,{\rm s}}
  {1 + 27.04(7)\times 10^{-3} }~, \end{equation*} with $|V_{ud}|$ the up-down quark mixing parameter, $\tau_n$ the neutron's lifetime, $\lambda$ the ratio of axial to vector charge, and $\Delta_R$ the short-distance matching correction. We find a shift in the long-distance radiative corrections compared to previous work, and discuss implications for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$ and tests of the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider electroweak corrections to Higgs boson pair production, taking
  into account the top quark Yukawa and Higgs boson self couplings. Using
  differential equations we compute a deep expansion of all master integrals
  in the high-energy limit and present analytic results for the two-loop
  box-type form factors. We show that precise numerical results can be obtained
  even for relatively small values of the Higgs boson transverse momentum. We
  compare against recent numerical results and find good agreement.</description>

      <title>Quark matter at four loops: hardships and how to overcome them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the pressure of cold and dense quark matter (QM) is known to significantly constrain the equation of state of neutron-star matter, a quantity playing a key role in deciphering the stars' internal structure. In this work, we make important progress towards determining the last unknown contribution to the pressure at Next-to-Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (N3LO) in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$, available through the sum of all four-loop vacuum diagrams of dense Quantum Chromodynamics. We demonstrate the cancellation of both the covariant gauge parameter and all infrared (IR) divergences in the sum, showcasing the effective-field-theory paradigm in action. For the remaining IR-finite four-loop integrals, we demonstrate the efficacy of the dense Loop Tree Duality method -- a novel numerical framework for multiloop calculations in thermal field theory. Together, our results show that completing the N3LO pressure of cold QM is no longer merely possible but for the first time concretely within reach.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Magnetized Quark Matter in the Chiral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of cold quark matter under strong magnetic fields in the frame of a nonlocal NJL model in the chiral limit. Our analysis focuses on deconfinement, chiral symmetry restoration, and the anisotropy in pressure induced by the external magnetic field. For $eB\lesssim 0.07~ \text{GeV}^2$, the critical chemical potential remains largely insensitive to the magnetic field, whereas at higher field strengths, transitions to chirally restored phases occur at progressively lower chemical potentials. The parallel and perpendicular pressures, respect to the magnetic field, exhibit distinct behaviors, reflecting the anisotropic nature of the system. Oscillations in the quark number density, driven by the de Haas van Alphen effect, reflect the quantized behavior of quarks in a magnetic field. Similarly, the magnetization displays oscillatory behavior, driven by the sequential filling of Landau levels. At lower external magnetic field strengths, contributions from orbital angular momentum and the population of higher Landau levels further modulate these oscillations. These results provide deeper insights into the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with implications for astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Spectral-statistics properties of the experimental and theoretical light baryon and meson spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the statistical fluctuation properties of the baryon and meson experimental mass spectra with those obtained from theoretical models (quark models and lattice QCD). We find that for the experimental spectra the statistical properties are close to those predicted by Random Matrix Theory for chaotic systems, while for the theoretical ones they are in general closer to those predicted for integrable systems and safely incompatible with those of chaotic systems. We stress the importance of the agreement of the fluctuation properties between experiment and theoretical models, as they determine the dynamical regime and the complexity of the real interactions. We emphasize the new statistical method we use, adapted for properly analyzing the fluctuation properties for very short spectral sequences.</description>

      <title>Distribution amplitudes of heavy-light pseudo-scalar and vector mesons from Dyson-Schwinger equations framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate leading-twist distribution amplitudes of ground state heavy-light pseudo-scalar and vector mesons, the results of $B^*$, $B^*_s$, $B_c^*$ mesons are reported for the first time within the Dyson-Schwinger equations framework. A novel numerical method for calculating Mellin moments is proposed, which can avoid extrapolation or fitting in previous similar studies. Based on it, we calculate the first eight Mellin moments of mesons and reconstruct their distribution amplitudes. It is found that, in flavor-asymmetric systems, distribution amplitude $\phi(x)$ is skewed to one side, with the position of the maximum $\sim M^f_E/(M^f_E+M^g_E)$, where $M_E$ is Euclidean constituent quark mass and $f/g$ denote the flavor of heavier/lighter quark in the meson, respectively. For systems with the same valence quark structure, the first Mellin moments follow the relation $\langle \xi \rangle_{0^-} &lt; \langle \xi \rangle^{\|}_{1^-} &lt; \langle \xi \rangle^{\perp}_{1^-}$, where $\xi = 2x - 1$ and $x$ is the momentum fraction carried by the heavier quark. Our predictions can be compared with experimental data and further theoretical calculations in the future, and the results of light mesons such as $\pi$, $K$, $\rho$ are consistent with recent lattice data.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent dark matter scattering in quasi-two-dimensional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prospects of detecting dark matter coupled to the spin of the electron, such that it may scatter and excite magnons - collective excitations of electronic spins. We show that materials exhibiting long-range magnetic order where the spins are coupled only along a plane may act as directional dark matter detectors. These quasi-2D materials possess anisotropic dispersion relations and structure functions which induce a sidereal modulation in the excitation rate. We calculate the expected signal rate for some candidate (anti)ferromagnets, demonstrating a possible route to the direct detection of spin-dependent dark matter in the keV to MeV mass range.</description>

      <title>Baryon construction with $\eta^\prime$ meson field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the low-energy regime, baryons with $N_f \geq 2$ have long been constructed as skyrmions or through bag models, but such constructions for $N_f = 1$ are hindered by the trivial topological structure of the meson field. Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryons can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\eta'$ domain wall, providing a possible link to quark-hadron continuity at high density. Retrospect to the qualitative or semi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryon on $\eta'$ domain wall, one-flavor baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets, resemble topological solitons, akin to skyrmions. Using the effective theory on the $\eta'$ domain wall which is conjectured to be the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon number naturally has spin $N_c/2$ thus can be interpreted as baryon or multi-baryon structure, while particle-vortex duality suggests that quarks carry a fractional topological charge $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In terms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles confined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are essential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework and thus provide deeper insights into baryons as nontrivial topological structures of the meson field. In this paper, we review the progress in this development with special interests in the $\eta^\prime$ domain wall dynamics. Naive extensions to $N_f\geq 2$ are also concerned.</description>

      <title>Spacetime profile of electromagnetic fields in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically estimate the spacetime profile of the electromagnetic fields produced in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4-7.7\;{\rm GeV}$ for a wide range of impact parameters $b=0-9\;{\rm fm}$, using a hadronic cascade model JAM (Jet AA Microscopic transport model). We demonstrate that (1) the produced electromagnetic fields are as strong as $eE, eB = {\mathcal O}((50\;{\rm MeV})^2)$; (2) that the produced fields extend in spacetime about $V_4 = {\mathcal O}((10\;{\rm fm})^4)$; (3) that the magnetic field dominates around the collision point, while the other broad regions of spacetime are dominated by the electric field; and (4) that a topological electromagnetic-field configuration such that ${\bf E}\cdot {\bf B} \neq 0$ is realized.</description>

      <title>Fits of $\alpha_s$ from event-shapes in the three-jet region: extension to all energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is an extension of a previous publication [1] where we fitted the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ together with the non-perturbative parameter $\alpha_0$ from event-shape and jet-shape distributions using power corrections computed in the three-jet region. In ref. [1] only ALEPH data at the $Z$-pole were used in the fit. Here, instead, we include a large data sample from various $e^+e^-$ experiments at energies ranging from 22 to 207 GeV and revisited the treatment of theoretical uncertainties. We find that the inclusion of different energies, while not changing the central fit result considerably, helps to disentangle the dependence of perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. Our best fit result is $\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1181 (+0.0002 -0.0005) (+0.0018 -0.0021)$, where the first error includes experimental uncertianties and the second one includes uncertainties associated with scale variation, mass effects, fit limits, non-perturbative schemes and non-perturbative uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Dirac neutrino mass model is proposed, based on an extended group structure of $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y \otimes A_4 \otimes Z_3 \otimes Z_{10}$ with the Type-I seesaw mechanism. This work explores the impact of parametrization and permutation in the charged lepton diagonalizing matrix, driven by free parameters in the charged lepton sector, on the predictions of observable parameters. Some interesting consequences on the neutrino mass hierarchies, mixing angles and the Dirac CP phase are observed. The framework also finds application in the study of charged lepton flavour violation and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Non-standard cosmological scenarios, Sommerfeld enhancement and asymmetric dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the relic density of asymmetric dark matter with long-range interactions in non-standard cosmological scenarios where the extra cosmic energy is introduced. The Hubble expansion rate is modified in non-standard cosmological models, which affects the relic density of dark matter. If the mass of the dark exchanged gauge boson is less than the mass of dark matter particles multiplied by the dark fine-structure constant, the wave function of the incoming particles of dark matter annihilation would be distorted away from the free plane-wave approximation, yielding the significant enhancements to annihilation cross sections, known as Sommerfeld enhancement. Sommerfeld enhancement results the asymmetric dark matter relic density under abundant, while the enhanced cosmic expansion rate increases the relic density of asymmetric dark matter by letting the decoupling from the thermal equilibrium occurs earlier. However, the mixed effect of modified cosmic expansion and the Sommerfeld enhancement on asymmetric dark matter density evolution becomes quite complicated. We investigated both effects on asymmetric dark matter freeze-out process and current relic abundance, which is significantly different from the standard situation. Further, we calculate the constraint relations of the asymmetric dark matter pertubative annihilation cross section and dark coupling constant with the mass of asymmetric dark matter, the asymmetry factor with the dark coupling constant, when the relic density of asymmetric dark matter falled in the observed region. The upper bounds on the mass of asymmetric dark matter for s-wave and p-wave annihilations are also derived.</description>

      <title>A general upper bound on the light dark matter scattering rate in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining an effective theory description of spin-1/2 dark matter (DM)-electron interactions in materials with linear response theory provides a powerful framework to model the scattering of DM, including in-medium effects, in detectors used for direct searches. Within this framework, we show that the rate of DM-induced electronic transitions in detector materials admits a theoretical upper bound under general assumptions on the underlying DM-electron coupling. In particular, our theoretical upper bound applies to models where DM couples to the electron density as well as the spin, paramagnetic and Rashba currents in materials, and arises from the Kramers-Kronig relations that constrain the analytic properties of the scattering rate. We evaluate our maximum rate formula numerically for Ar, Xe, Ge, and Si targets and find that Ge and Si detectors are closer to saturate this theoretical upper bound, but still far from saturation when DM couples to densities or currents which are different from the electron density. This motivates the exploration of a different class of materials to effectively probe such coupling forms.</description>

      <title>Factorisation schemes for proton PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond leading-order, perturbative QCD requires a choice of factorisation scheme to define the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and hard-process cross-section. The modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$) scheme has long been adopted as the default choice due to its simplicity. Alternative schemes have been proposed with specific purposes, including, recently, PDF positivity and NLO parton-shower matching. In this paper we assemble these schemes in a common notation for the first time. We perform a detailed comparison of their features, both analytically and numerically, and estimate the resulting factorisation-scheme uncertainty for LHC phenomenology.</description>

      <title>'t Hooft model in the temporal gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider QCD$_2$ in the $N_c \to \infty$ limit at fixed $g^2N_c$. The derivation starts from equal-time $q\bar q$ bound states in coordinate space and temporal ($A^0=0$) gauge, avoiding the use of quark and gluon propagators. The wave function is given analytically by a $_1F_1$ function with an explicit frame dependence. In the Infinite Momentum Frame the Fourier transformed wave function satisfies the 't Hooft equation, however with contributions also from quarks with negative kinetic energy. This difference with previous analyses of the model may be related to boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimizers for Stabilizing Likelihood-free Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of applications in particle physics and beyond use neural networks as unbinned likelihood ratio estimators applied to real or simulated data. Precision requirements on the inference tasks demand a high-level of stability from these networks, which are affected by the stochastic nature of training. We show how physics concepts can be used to stabilize network training through a physics-inspired optimizer. In particular, the Energy Conserving Descent (ECD) optimization framework uses classical Hamiltonian dynamics on the space of network parameters to reduce the dependence on the initial conditions while also stabilizing the result near the minimum of the loss function. We develop a version of this optimizer known as $ECD_{q=1}$, which has few free hyperparameters with limited ranges guided by physical reasoning. We apply $ECD_{q=1}$ to representative likelihood-ratio estimation tasks in particle physics and find that it out-performs the widely-used Adam optimizer. We expect that ECD will be a useful tool for wide array of data-limited problems, where it is computationally expensive to exhaustively optimize hyperparameters and mitigate fluctuations with ensembling.</description>

      <title>Unitarity triangle angles explained: a predictive new quark mass matrix texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel quark mass matrix texture-pair with five free parameters, which fits the four quark mass ratios $m_s/m_b$, $m_d/m_b$, $m_c/m_t$, $m_u/m_t$, and the four CKM quark mixing observables. The matrices each have one texture zero, but the main innovation here is a ``geometric'' ansatz exploiting a pair of small complex expansion parameters, based on the geometry of the Unitarity Triangle. The fit to the observables is in good agreement with current experimental values renormalised to $\sim\!\!10^4$ TeV, and offers decisive tests against future high-precision measurements of the unitarity triangle angles at the weak scale. We identify two novel symmetries of these mass matrices which explain the phenomenologically-successful relations $\alpha\equiv\phi_2\simeq\pibytwo$ and $\beta\equiv\phi_1\simeq\pibyeight$.</description>

      <title>Reactor antineutrinos CE$\nu$NS on germanium: CONUS+ and TEXONO as a new gateway to SM and BSM physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) is a key process for probing Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) properties. Following its first detection by the COHERENT collaboration, recent reactor-based experiments provide a unique opportunity to refine our current understanding. In particular, the high-precision data from CONUS+, combined with the strong bounds from TEXONO, not only validate the CE$\nu$NS process at low energies but also provide improved constraints on the weak mixing angle, neutrino electromagnetic properties - including charge radius, millicharge, and magnetic moment - as well as non-standard interactions and light mediators. We also examine the role of elastic neutrino-electron scattering, which gains significance in certain BSM scenarios and allows us to obtain the best limit for the millicharge of the electron neutrinos. By combining reactor and higher-energy spallation neutron source measurements, this work strengthens CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool for testing the Standard Model and beyond.</description>

      <title>CGAN-Based Framework for Meson Mass and Width Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are influential machine learning models that have gained prominence across various research fields, including high-energy physics (HEP) simulations. Among them, Conditional GANs (CGANs) offer a unique advantage by conditioning on specific parameters, making them particularly well-suited for meson studies. Given the limited size of the available meson dataset$ - $based on the quark content, quantum numbers, mass, and width$ - $this study, for the first time, applies the CGAN framework to augment the dataset of mesons, while preserving the inherent characteristics of the original data. Using this enhanced dataset, we employ the CGAN model to estimate the mass and width of both ordinary and exotic mesons, based solely on their quark content and quantum numbers. Our CGAN$ - $based predictions highlight the framework's potential as a reliable tool for meson property estimation, providing valuable insights for future research in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Constraining the impact of standard model phase transitions on primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16563v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions in the early universe lead to a reduction in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. This exponentially enhances the formation rate of primordial black holes. However, this sensitivity to the equation of state is the same that primordial black hole abundances show to the primordial curvature power spectrum amplitude. In this paper, we investigate peaked power spectra and show the challenges associated with motivating populations of primordial black holes with standard model enhancements. The parametrisation of different power spectra plays an important role in this discussion. The allowed parameter space consistent with a large QCD phase transition impact on the primordial black hole abundance differs greatly. This is particularly evident for broader spectra. We also show that, in our framework, the electroweak phase transition cannot significantly affect the overall abundance.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interacting Bose-Einstein correlations in Fourier space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion physics experiments, a state of matter is created that existed in the early Universe: the quark-gluon plasma. This strongly interacting matter exists in today's experiments only within a range of a few femtometers and for a duration of a few femtometers per speed of light, making its resolution with optical tools impossible. However, there is a method that allows for a closer look into the structure of the quark-gluon plasma: femtoscopy. Initially used in astronomy, femtoscopy is based on the quantum mechanical indistinguishability of identical particles, which causes them to arrive at detectors in a correlated manner. The measurable correlation is related to the spacetime structure of the particle-emitting source, which in heavy-ion physics is the quark-gluon plasma created in collisions. For free particles, a relatively simple relationship exists between the source and the correlation (essentially a Fourier transform). However, this relationship becomes complex when accurately accounting for the repulsive Coulomb interaction between final-state electrically charged particles. Our paper presents a new method that is more precise than previously used ones, yet less computationally demanding, especially for the exotic source function shapes. Mathematically, the method is interesting because it exactly handles many emerging integrals and limits. Practically, it is ready for use in experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Spatially-Correlated Random Fields: Extreme-Value Statistics and Clustering Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare events of large-scale spatially-correlated exponential random fields are studied. The influence of spatial correlations on clustering and non-sphericity is investigated. The size of the performed simulations permits to study beyond-$7.5$-sigma events ($1$ in $10^{13}$). As an application, this allows to resolve individual Hubble patches which fulfill the condition for primordial black hole formation. It is argued that their mass spectrum is drastically altered due to co-collapse of clustered overdensities as well as the mutual threshold-lowering through the latter. Furthermore, the corresponding non-sphericities imply possibly large changes in the initial black hole spin distribution.</description>

      <title>The spatial string tension and its effects on screening correlators in a thermal QCD plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the spatial Wilson line correlator for 2+1 flavor QCD using highly improved staggered quark discretization for fermions and in quenched QCD for a wide range of temperatures, from the chiral crossover temperature $\mathrm{T_{pc}\simeq 156}$ MeV or the deconfinement temperature $\simeq 300$ MeV respectively, up to $2$ GeV. Extracting the spatial string tension for different lattice cut-offs and by performing a continuum extrapolation of this observable, we show that the soft (magnetic) gluons interact non-perturbatively even at temperatures $\gtrsim 1$ GeV. We provide incriminating evidences to demonstrate that dimensionally reduced effective theories can describe these soft quark and gluon quasi-particles for both quenched and $2+1$ flavor QCD, at temperatures $\mathrm{T\gtrsim 5T_{pc}}$. We also show for the first time the imprints of the non-perturbative pseudo-potential in the properties of mesonic screening masses for temperatures ranging from $0.8$-$164$ GeV in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Physics on and off the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study light-front physics and conformal symmetry, and their interplay both on and off the light cone. The full symmetry of the light cone is conformal symmetry not just Lorentz symmetry. Spontaneously breaking conformal symmetry gives masses to particles and takes them off the light cone. Canonical quantization specifies equal-time commutators on the light cone. Equal instant-time and equal light-front-time commutators look very different, but can be shown to be equivalent by looking at unequal-time commutators. We discuss the connection of the light-front approach to the infinite momentum frame approach, and show that vacuum graphs are outside this framework. We show that there is a light-front structure to both AdS/CFT and the eikonal approximation. While mass generation involves scale breaking mass scales, we show that such mass scales can arise via dynamical symmetry breaking in the presence of scale invariant interactions at a renormalization group fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct the cosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of XMM-Newton soft proton flares II. Systematics in the proton spectral analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy protons entering the field of view of the XMM-Newton telescope scatter with the X-ray mirror surface and might reach the X-ray detectors on the focal plane. They manifest in the form of a sudden increase in the rates, usually referred to as soft proton flares. By knowing the conversion factor between the soft proton energy and the deposited charge on the detector, it is possible to derive the incoming flux and to study the environment of the Earth magnetosphere at different distances. We present the results of testing these matrices with real data for the first time, while also exploring the seasonal and solar activity effect on the proton environment. The selected spectra are relative to 55 simultaneous MOS and PN observations with flares raised in four different temporal windows: December-January and July-August of 2001-2002 (solar maximum) and 2019-2020 (solar minimum). The main result of the spectral analysis is that the physical model representative of the proton spectra at the input of the telescope is a power law. However, a second and phenomenological component is necessary to take into account imprecision in the generation of the matrices at softer energies.</description>

Abstract: In recent years the rare kaon decay has been computed directly at the physical point. However, this calculation is currently limited by stochastic noise stemming from a light and charm quark loop GIM subtraction. The split-even approach is an alternative estimator for such loop differences, and has shown a large variance reduction in certain quantities. We present an investigation into the use of the split-even estimator in the calculation of the rare kaon decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering of two identical pNGBs (pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Bosons) in Sp(4) gauge theory with two mass-degenerate Dirac fermions in the pseudo-real fundamental representation. This theory serves as a realization of a SIMP (Strongly Interacting Massive Particles) Dark Matter model. SIMPs are an exciting dark matter candidate as they make use of a new relic density mechanism and provide potential solutions to the so-called small-scale structure problems. These theories are realized by a confining dark sector which includes non-perturbative signatures. While most of the research focuses on ChPT (Chiral Perturbation Theory), first-principle verification of these models is indispensable. In these proceedings we give an update on scattering properties in the most common channel and give an outlook on the projects that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from metastable cosmic strings in the delayed scaling scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) such as NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, and CPTA suggest the presence of nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). While such signals could be explained by gravitational waves from a network of metastable cosmic strings (CSs), standard scenarios involving the Kibble-Zurek mechanism triggered by a thermal potential face significant challenges. Specifically, these scenarios predict a GWB spectrum inconsistent with the non-detection at higher frequencies by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) for CSs with relatively large string tension. It is also difficult to prevent the monopole forming phase transition just before the CS forming symmetry breaking, which spoils the CS network formation. In contrast, a delayed scaling scenario, where the CSs start to emit GWs at a later time due to the dilution during inflation, alleviates these issues. This scenario allows for a larger string tension while monopoles are sufficiently diluted such that the CS network safely forms. In this study, we clarify the spectrum of stochastic GWB from metastable CSs in the delayed scaling scenario, consistent with the PTA observations while satisfying the LVK constraints. Furthermore, we explore its potential signatures at frequencies accessible to other detectors such as LVK as well as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin or DECIGO and BBO. We also discuss the implications on inflation and underlying UV theories, such as the grand unified theories.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Big Rip Singularities in Phantom Scalar Field theory with Gauss-Bonnet term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar within a spatially flat FLRW geometry. Moreover, we assume a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter term. We perform a detailed phase space analysis using two sets of dimensionless variables. Specifically, we introduce dimensionless variables based on the Hubble normalization approach and a new set based on the matter-scalar field normalization. These two sets of variables allow for a comprehensive phase space analysis. This model supports inflationary solutions without the Big Rip or Big Crunch singularities appearing as asymptotic solutions. This outcome is attributed to the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. The result remains valid even in the absence of the interaction term.</description>

      <title>Chiral non-Abelian vortex molecules in dense QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD admits non-Abelian vortices, that are superfluid vortices with confined color-magnetic fluxes. Vortex solutions were thus far constructed in an axially symmetric Ansatz with common vortex winding in the left- and right-handed diquark condensates. In this paper, we explore vortex solutions without any Ansatz. In addition to axially symmetric configurations known before, we find that the axial symmetry is broken in certain parameter regions; in one case a single vortex is split into two chiral non-Abelian vortices, i.e. vortices with winding only in the left or right-handed diquark condensate, and they are connected by one or two domain walls forming a non-Abelian vortex molecule. In the other case, a chiral non-Abelian vortex molecule is confined inside a domain wall elongated to spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>Towards more accurate $B_{(s)}\rightarrow\pi(K)$ and $D_{(s)}\rightarrow\pi(K)$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present progress on the calculation of scalar, vector, and tensor form factors for the following meson decays: $B\rightarrow\pi$, $B_s\rightarrow K$, $D\rightarrow\pi$ and $D_s\rightarrow K$. This calculation uses the MILC HISQ gluon field ensembles with HISQ valence quarks. We generate ensembles of correlator data with varying lattice spacings, some as small as 0.044 fm. Some ensembles have a strange-to-light quark mass ratio of 5:1 and others use the physical light quark mass. The fully-relativistic, heavy-HISQ approach is used for the heavy quark, with simulation masses ranging from the charm to near the bottom. This heavy-HISQ approach provides nearly full coverage of the kinematic range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MiniBooNE low-energy excess stands as an unexplained anomaly in short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. It has been shown that it can be explained in the context of dark sector models. Here, we provide an overview of the possible new-physics solutions based on electron, photon, and dilepton final states. We systematically discuss the various production mechanisms for dark particles in neutrino-nucleus scattering. Our main result is a comprehensive fit to the MiniBooNE energy spectrum in the parameter space of dark neutrino models, where short-lived heavy neutral leptons are produced in neutrino interactions and decay to $e^+e^-$ pairs inside the detector. For the first time, other experiments will be able to directly confirm or rule out dark neutrino interpretations of the MiniBooNE low-energy excess.</description>

Abstract: Extracting constraints on kinetic mixing between a new $U(1)'$ gauge boson hiding under the Standard Model $Z$ boson resonance requires the formalism of non-Hermitian two-point correlation functions at 1-loop order. We derive self-consistent collider constraints on $Z'$ bosons with kinetic mixing in a narrow mass window around the $Z$ boson, considering both model-independent and model-dependent bounds. Our treatment elucidates the importance of both avoided level crossing and width suppression due to the quantum Zeno effect in interpreting the existing constraints. We also discuss the implications for future measurements on the $Z$-pole.</description>

Abstract: The power and the probability of electromagnetic radiation from an electron in a constant background tensor field violating Lorentz invariance are calculated. The case of a background field of the quasielectric type is considered. The angular distribution and the polarization of the radiation are studied. Using present experimental constraints on the background field strength, it is shown that the radiation effect can manifest itself under astrophysical conditions at ultrahigh electron energy.</description>

      <title>All order factorization for virtual Compton scattering at next-to-leading power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss all-order factorization for the virtual Compton process at next-to-leading power (NLP) in the $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/Q$ and $\sqrt{-t}/Q$ expansion (twist-3), both in the double-deeply-virtual case and the single-deeply-virtual case. We use the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) as the main theoretical tool. We conclude that collinear factorization holds in the double-deeply virtual case, where both photons are far off-shell. The agreement is found with the known results for the hard matching coefficients at leading order $\alpha_s^0$, and we can therefore connect the traditional approach with SCET. In the single-deeply-virtual case, commonly called deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS), the contribution of non-target collinear regions complicates the factorization. These include momentum modes collinear to the real photon and (ultra)soft interactions between the photon-collinear and target-collinear modes. However, such contributions appear only for the transversely polarized virtual photon at the NLP accuracy and in fact it is the only NLP $\sim (\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/Q)^1 \sim (\sqrt{-t}/Q)^1$ contribution in that case. We therefore conclude that the DVCS amplitude for a longitudinally polarized virtual photon, where the leading power $\sim (\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/Q)^0 \sim (\sqrt{-t}/Q)^0$ contribution vanishes, is free of non-target collinear contributions and the collinear factorization in terms of twist-3 GPDs holds in that case as well.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Axions from Higher-Form Symmetries in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extra-dimensional axion solves the strong CP problem while largely circumventing the quality problem that plagues its four-dimensional counterparts. Such high quality can be clearly understood in terms of the generalized global symmetries of the higher-dimensional theory. We emphasize that an electric one-form symmetry is entirely responsible for protecting the potential of axions arising from 5D gauge theories and use this to systematically characterize the extra-dimensional axion quality problem. We identify three ways of breaking this one-form symmetry to generate an axion potential: adding electrically charged matter, gauging a magnetic higher-form symmetry, and turning on an ABJ anomaly. In the latter case, we identify new ways of generating an axion potential via extra-dimensional magnetic monopoles. We also discuss how the axion is modified if the protective electric one-form symmetry is itself gauged. Finally, we relate these effects to gravitational expectations for the quality problem via generalized weak gravity conjectures. The clarity that generalized symmetries bring to the extra-dimensional axion quality problem highlights their relevance to particle phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions from COHERENT, PandaX-4T and XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the effective field theory framework, using data from the first measurement of solar $^8$B neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) in the PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments and data from the COHERENT experiment. The impacts of neutrino NSIs on the CE$\nu$NS cross section and the matter effect in the propagation of solar neutrinos are included, while we obtain that the expected number of CE$\nu$NS events is more sensitive to neutrino NSIs appearing in the cross section. Due to relatively large statistical uncertainties, the sensitivities of the PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments to the neutrino NSIs are currently limited, compared to the COHERENT experiment. Besides, we find that since the central value of the measured CE$\nu$NS counts significantly differs from the Standard Model prediction, the sensitivity of PandaX-4T experiment is even more restricted compared to XENONnT. However, the measurements of PandaX-4T and XENONnT are uniquely sensitive to the neutrino NSIs for the $\tau$ flavor due to oscillation feature of the solar $^8$B neutrinos. We also assess how the experimental central value, exposure, and systematic uncertainties will affect the constraints on neutrino NSIs from various CE$\nu$NS measurements in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential to search for semi-visible jets (SVJs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using initial-state radiation (ISR). Both photon ISR and jet ISR channels are considered, using a benchmark signal model with the decay of a leptophobic $Z^\prime$ mediator forming two SVJs. We compare and extend several techniques to decompose the missing transverse momentum into per-jet contributions, in order to reconstruct the mediator mass and to define a new observable measuring the fraction of invisible dark hadrons. The presence of ISR facilitates the identification of the SVJs, and the resulting boost improves the resolution of the observables, especially for models with high invisible fractions. We combine the two observables to propose a complete search strategy and discuss an extension of the strategy to probe the whole model parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an in-depth study of an unprobed pMSSM region offering a natural solution to dark matter. Since the 1980s this region has been referred to as the "bulk", consisting of sub 200 GeV neutralinos and right-handed smuons. The bulk satisfies recent muon $g_{\mu}-2$ measurements and sustains consistency with $all$ presently operating SUSY experiments and LHC constraints. Initial ingress into the bulk will arrive soon via the LUX-ZEPLIN 1000-day experiment. The ATLAS Collaboration at the LHC has confirmed that observation of these light right-handed smuon events can occur at the ongoing LHC Run 3 and forthcoming High-Luminosity LHC. Moreover, the future FCC-ee and CEPC circular colliders should handily observe the events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of electron EDM experiments has been increasing at a rapid pace, and could yield indications of new physics in the coming decade. An intriguing possibility is that an EDM signal could be generated by new, electroweak-charged particles at the TeV scale that couple to the Higgs and contribute to the electron EDM at two-loop order via Barr-Zee diagrams. A high-energy muon collider could decisively search for new physics at this scale. In this work, we explore this complementarity between colliders and EDM experiments, and note that Barr-Zee diagrams from the aforementioned particles are closely related to vector-boson scattering processes at a muon collider. These loop corrections lead to kinematic features in the differential cross sections of these processes, dictated by the optical theorem. We demonstrate this connection in the context of the singlet-doublet and doublet-triplet extensions to the SM, explore the detectability of these features at a muon collider experiment, and discuss how these measurements can be used to ascertain the underlying model parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) are entering a new era. The failure to observe signals of sparticle production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has eroded the central motivation for SUSY breaking at the weak scale. However, String Theory requires SUSY at the fundamental scale $M_s$ and hence SUSY could be broken at some high scale below $M_s$. Actually, if this were the case, the lack of experimental evidence for low-energy SUSY could have been anticipated, because most stringy models with high-scale SUSY breaking predict that sparticles would start popping up above about 10 TeV, well beyond the reach of current LHC experiments. We show that using next generation LHC experiments currently envisioned for the Forward Physics Facility (FPF) we could search for signals of neutrino-modulino oscillations to probe models with string scale in the grand unification region and SUSY breaking driven by sequestered gravity in gauge mediation. This is possible because of the unprecedented flux of neutrinos to be produced as secondary products in LHC collisions during the high-luminosity era and the capability of FPF experiments to detect and identify their flavors.</description>

      <title>Is the finite temperature effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the applicability of the finite temperature effective potential in the equation of motion of a homogeneous "misaligned" scalar condensate $\varphi$, and find important caveats that severely restrict its domain of validity: i:) the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is in general not warranted, ii:) we show a direct relation between the effective potential and the thermodynamic entropy density $\mathcal{S}= - \partial V_{eff}(T,\varphi)/\partial T$, which entails that for a dynamical $\varphi(t)$ the entropy becomes a non-monotonic function of time, iii:) parametric instabilities in both cases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking lead to profuse particle production with non-thermal distribution functions, iv:) in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking spinodal instabilities yield a complex effective potential, internal energy and entropy, an untenable situation in thermodynamics. All these caveats associated with dynamical aspects, cannot be overcome by finite temperature equilibrium resummation schemes. We argue that the dynamics of the condensate leads to decoupling and freeze-out from (LTE), and propose a closed quantum system approach based on unitary time evolution. It yields the correct equations of motion without the caveats of the effective potential, and provides a fully renormalized and thermodynamically consistent framework to study the dynamics of the "misaligned" condensate, with real and conserved energy and entropy amenable to numerical study. The evolution of the condensate leads to profuse stimulated particle production with non-thermal distribution functions. Possible emergent asymptotic non-thermal states and eventual re-thermalization are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Modification of jets travelling through a brick-like medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a continued open question how there can be an azimuthal anisotropy of high $p_\perp$ particles quantified by a sizable $v_2$ in p+Pb collisions when, at the same time, the nuclear modification factor $R_\text{AA}$ is consistent with unity. We address this puzzle within the framework of the jet quenching model \textsc{Jewel}. In the absence of reliable medium models for small collision systems we use the number of scatterings per parton times the squared Debye mass to characterise the strength of medium modifications. Working with a simple brick medium model we show that, for small systems and not too strong modifications, $R_\text{AA}$ and $v_2$ approximately scale with this quantity. We find that a comparatively large number of scatterings is needed to generate measurable jet quenching. Our results indicate that the $R_\text{AA}$ corresponding to the observed $v_2$ could fall within the experimental uncertainty. Thus, while there is currently no contradiction with the measurements, our results indicate that $v_2$ and $R_\text{AA}$ go hand-in-hand. We also discuss departures from scaling, in particular due to sizable inelastic energy loss.</description>

      <title>Spin identification of the mono-Z$^{\prime}$ resonance in muon-pair production at the ILC with simulated electron-positron collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV</title>

Abstract: In this analysis, we investigate the angular distribution of low-mass dimuon pairs produced in simulated electron-positron collisions at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), which operates at a center of mass energy of 500 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb\(^{-1}\). We focus on the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) variable, defined in the Collins-Soper frame. In the Standard Model, the production of low-mass dimuon pairs is primarily driven by the Drell-Yan process, which exhibits a pronounced forward-backward asymmetry. However, many scenarios beyond the Standard Model predict different shapes for the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) distribution. This angular distribution can be instrumental in distinguishing between these models in the event of excess observations beyond the Standard Model. We have used the mono-Z\(^{\prime}\) model to interpret the simulated data for our analysis. In the absence of any discoveries of new physics, we establish upper limits at the 95\% confidence level on the masses of various particles in the model, including the spin-1 \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, as well as fermionic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom in Parton Language: the Birth of Perturbative QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I review the contributions of Giorgio Parisi to perturbative QCD. Concentrated in a decade, they mark the transition of the theory of strong interactions from a set of loosely connected ideas based on models, to a quantum field theory that is now an integral part of the standard model of fundamental interactions. Parisi's contributions have established at a very early stage ideas, methods and tools that are now standard, and in several cases anticipated results that only became prominent in the XXIst century.</description>

      <title>Light scalar beyond the Higgs mixing limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the interactions of a light scalar singlet, which mixes with the Standard Model~(SM) Higgs, also receive other UV contributions of comparable size. We focus, in particular, on the flavor aligned limit, where couplings of the light scalar to the SM are almost flavor diagonal, but not necessarily proportional to the Higgs Yukawa couplings. The phenomenology of such a general flavor aligned light scalar differs from both the Higgs-mixed scalar, as well as from a general axion-like particle. We explore this for light scalar masses below a few hundred MeV, such that they can be produced in kaon decays, and in decays of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons, and the transitions described using chiral perturbation theory. We then derive constraints on the light scalar interactions, assuming that light scalar decays are either just into photons or are invisible. We also discuss several UV examples of such light scalar models: a two-Higgs doublet model extended by a light scalar, a light dilaton from the dark sector, and a SM extended by heavy vector-like quarks and a light scalar. For the latter we also performed matching onto low energy theory at one-loop.</description>

      <title>Measurement of in-medium jet modification using direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The STAR Collaboration presents measurements of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from energetic direct-photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral-pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in p+p and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ GeV over a broad kinematic range, for jet resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. Medium-induced jet yield suppression is observed to be larger for $R$=0.2 than for 0.5, reflecting the angular range of jet energy redistribution due to quenching. The predictions of model calculations incorporating jet quenching are not fully consistent with the observations. These results provide new insight into the physical origins of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Running of the Spectral Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year data provides compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal consists in a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index \gamma. In this paper, we consider the next logical step beyond this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency dependence) of the spectral index, \gamma_run(f) = \gamma + \beta \ln(f/f_ref). We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15-year data and perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL) model, which results in a 95% credible interval for the parameter \beta consistent with no running, \beta \in [-0.80,2.96], and an inconclusive Bayes factor, B(RPL vs. CPL) = 0.69 +- 0.01. We thus conclude that, at present, the minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal; however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero \beta. Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper limits from big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. II. Non-time-radial-symmetric and loop quantum gravity-inspired metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr (non-time-radial)-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs, with the lower edge moving potentially more than an order of magnitude. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>The four-gluon vertex from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The four-gluon one-particle irreducible Green function contributes to various quantities with phenomenological relevance. An example where the four-gluon plays a role is the determination of the gluon propagator, a basic building block for QCD, using continuum methods. This four leg Green function is poorly known and we are only starting to grasp its non-perturbative structure. Here, we report on the computation of the one-particle irreducible four-gluon Green function, in the Landau gauge, with lattice simulations. Besides stating the problems associated with the computation, several form factors that characterise this Green function are measured.</description>
