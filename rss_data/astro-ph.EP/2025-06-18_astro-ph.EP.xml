      <title>The Orbit of WASP-4 b is in Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-4 b is a hot Jupiter exhibiting a decreasing orbital period, prompting investigations into potential mechanisms driving its evolution. We analyzed 173 transit light curves, including 37 new observations, and derived mid-transit timings with EXOFAST, forming the most extensive TTV dataset for this system. Adding 58 literature timings and removing unreliable data, we constructed a TTV diagram with 216 points. Our analysis considered linear, quadratic, and apsidal motion models, with the quadratic model proving to be significantly superior in all model comparison statistics. We found no significant periodic signals in the data. The quadratic model allows us to infer a tidal quality factor of Q' ~ 80,000 from the orbital decay rate if this is due to stellar tides. Theoretical considerations indicate that such efficient dissipation is possible due to internal gravity waves in the radiative core of WASP-4, but only in our models with a more evolved host star, possibly near the end of its main-sequence lifetime, and with a larger radius than the observed one. Our main-sequence models produce only about a third of the required dissipation (Q' ~ 200,000 - 500,000). Therefore, the observed orbital decay can only be explained by a slightly larger or more evolved host, resembling the case for WASP-12. Our findings highlight the need for further stellar modeling and improvement in our current understanding of tidal dissipation mechanisms driving orbital decay in close-in exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Trappist-1 exoplanets with coronal mass ejections: Joule heating, Poynting fluxes and the role of magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares and associated Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are energetic stellar phenomena that shape the space weather around planets. Close-in exoplanets orbiting active cool stars are likely exposed to extreme space weather whose effects on the planets are not understood well enough. The terrestrial Trappist-1 exoplanets are excellent targets to study the impact of CMEs on close-in planets and their atmospheres. We study the role of planetary magnetic fields in shielding the planet from external forcing. We expand on recent studies of CME-induced Joule heating of planetary interiors and atmospheres by including a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the interaction. We study the interaction of CMEs with Tr-1b &amp; e using MHD simulations. We consider magnetic flux rope and density pulse CMEs. We calculate induction heating in the planetary interior and ionospheric Joule heating for various intrinsic magnetic field strengths and CME energies. Magnetospheric compression is the main driver of magnetic variability. Planetary magnetic fields enhance induction heating in the interior although the effect is weaker with flux rope CMEs. Single event dissipation rates with 1-hour CMEs amount to 20 TW and 1 TW for Trappist-1b and e, respectively. Taking CME occurrence rates into account, annual average heating rates are ~10 TW (b) and ~1 TW (e), which are placed near the lower end of previous estimates. Within the range of studied planetary magnetic field strengths $B_p$, magnetospheric Poynting fluxes scale with $B_p^3$. Thus, stronger magnetic fields increase CME energy absorption. Ionospheric Joule heating rates amount to $10^{3-4}$ TW and decrease for stronger magnetic fields $B_p$. These heating rates exceed the average stellar XUV input by 1-2 orders of magnitude and might severely impact atmospheric erosion. In a steady state stellar wind ionospheric Joule heating amounts to ~$10^2$ TW.</description>

      <title>Dancing on the Grain: Variety of CO and its isotopologue fluxes as a result of surface chemistry and T Tauri disk properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the moment, one of the main ways to infer the disk mass is to use a combination of CO isotopologue line observations. A number of theoretical studies have concluded that CO must be a reliable gas tracer as its relative abundance depends on disk parameters only weakly. However, the observed line fluxes cannot always be easily used to infer the column density, much less the abundance of CO. The aim of this work is to study the dependence of the CO isotopologue millimeter line fluxes on the astrochemical model parameters of a standard protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star and to conclude whether they or their combinations can be reliably used to determine disk parameters. Our case is set apart from earlier studies in the literature by the usage of a comprehensive chemical network with grain surface chemistry together with line radiative transfer. We use the astrochemical model ANDES together with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to simulate CO isotopologue line fluxes from a set of disks with varying key parameters (disk mass, disk radius, stellar mass, and inclination). We study how these values change with one parameter varying and others fixed and approximate the dependences log-linearly. We describe the dependences of CO isotopologue fluxes on all chosen disk parameters. Physical and chemical processes responsible for these dependences are analyzed and explained for each parameter. We show that using a combination of the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O line fluxes, the mass can be estimated only within two orders of magnitude uncertainty and characteristic radius within one order of magnitude uncertainty. We find that inclusion of grain surface chemistry reduces $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O fluxes which can explain the underestimation of disk mass in the previous studies.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Spectra of Comets: Rejecting the Detection of Pentacene, Toluene, and Fe+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study announced the detection of three bands in the ultraviolet emission spectra of more than a dozen comets, assigning two of them to pentacene (C$_{22}$H$_{14}$) and the third one to toluene (C$_7$H$_8$). The comparison of the spectra with the results of exploitable laboratorymeasurements on rare-gas-matrix-isolated pentacene and on jet-cooled toluene does not reveal elements that would justify the assignment, which is therefore unsubstantiated. The study also claimed the detection of an Fe II line in the gas of all but one comet. Yet, spectroscopic data on Fe II do not corroborate the attribution. Because spectroscopic measurements on the ultraviolet emission of pentacene in the gas phase are not available, this work also presents a synthetic spectrum of the S$_5$ $\rightarrow$ S$_0$ transition relevant to the wavelength range of the observations. Calculated using density functional theory and its time-dependent extension, the synthetic spectrum may facilitate the search for pentacene fluorescence in cometary spectra until laboratory measurements are accessible.</description>

      <title>How CO Affects the Composition of Titan's Tholins Generated with ECR Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Titan's atmosphere possesses thick haze layers, but their formation mechanisms remain poorly understood, including the influence of oxygen-containing gas components on organic matter synthesis. As the most abundant oxygen-containing gas, the presence of CO has been found to exert a significant impact on the generation of oxygen-containing organic compounds. Therefore, investigating the influence of CO on the production and composition of Tholins through laboratory simulations, holds profound scientific significance in the context of Titan. The work presented here is an experimental simulation designed to evaluate the impact of CO on the atmospheric chemistry of Titan. To this end, CO was introduced into the standard N2/CH4 mixture at varying mixing ratios from 0.2% to 9%, and exposed to Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) plasma to initiate photochemical reactions. Optical emission spectroscopy was employed for gas-phase in situ characterization, while infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to analyze the resulting solid products (tholins). Our results demonstrate that the addition of CO enriches the complexity of the chemical system. CO not only supplies oxygen to the system, but also enhances nitrogen's reactivity and incorporation, enhancing the number and quantity of the organic products.</description>

      <title>Impact of Gravity Waves From Tropospheric and Non-tropospheric Sources on the Middle and Upper Atmosphere and Comparison with ICON/MIGHTI Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical and thermal roles of internal gravity waves generated in the troposphere and above using the Coupled Middle Atmosphere Thermosphere-2 General Circulation Model. This model incorporates the whole atmosphere nonlinear gravity wave parameterization and its extension to include non-tropospheric sources. We conducted model experiments for northern summer solstice conditions, first including only tropospheric sources, then including sources localized at 50 and 90 km, and uniformly distributed over all heights. The simulated differences in mean temperature and horizontal winds demonstrate that gravity waves produce the greatest dynamical and thermal changes in the latter case compared to the localized sources. While the gravity wave drag is longitudinally uniform in the lower thermosphere, it is more localized in the upper thermosphere in all the simulations. Waves from uniformly distributed sources increase the longitudinal variability of zonal winds in the thermosphere up to $\sim$150 km. Gravity wave effects exhibit different local time variations in the lower thermosphere (100--140 km) than in the upper thermosphere. In the upper thermosphere, gravity wave effects are stronger during the day than at night. In contrast, nighttime gravity wave effects are stronger than the daytime ones in the lower thermosphere. Finally, a comparison with ICON-MIGHTI observations shows that the model reproduces the basic structure of thermospheric winds, performing better with zonal winds than with meridional winds. Adding non-tropospheric wave sources modifies wind structures in wave-breaking regions, but does not improve the global statistical comparison.</description>

      <title>The possibility for panspermia in the galaxy by means of planetary dust grains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04990v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By obtaining the assumption that planetary dust particles can escape from the gravitational attraction of a planet, we consider the possibility for the dust grains to leave the star's system by means of the radiation pressure. By taking the typical dust parameters into account, we consider their dynamics and show that they can reach the deep cosmos, taking part in panspermia. It has been shown that, during $5$ billion years, the dust grains will reach $10^5$ stellar systems, and by taking the Drake equation into account, it has been shown that the whole galaxy will be full of planetary dust particles.</description>

      <title>A transiting multi-planet system in the 61 million year old association Theia 116</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing and characterizing young planetary systems can aid in unveiling the evolutionary mechanisms that sculpt the mature exoplanet population. As an all-sky survey, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has expanded the known young planet population as it has observed young comoving stellar populations. This work presents the discovery of a multiplanet system orbiting the 61 Myr old G4V star TIC 434398831 (M = 0.99 Msun, R = 0.91 Rsun, Teff = 5638 K, Tmag = 11.31) located in the Theia 116 comoving population. We estimate the population's age based on rotation periods measured from the TESS light curves, isochrone fitting, and measurements of lithium equivalent widths in the spectra of Theia 116 members. The TESS FFI light curves reveal a mini-Neptune (Rb = 3.51 Rearth, Pb = 3.69 days) and super-Neptune (Rc = 5.63 Rearth, Pc = 6.21 days) with an orbital period ratio slightly larger than 5:3. Follow-up observations from CHEOPS and ground-based telescopes confirm the transits of TIC 434398831 b and c, and constrain their transit times. We explore the potential mass-loss histories of the two planets in order to probe possible initial conditions of the planets immediately after formation.</description>

Abstract: Measuring the properties of planets younger than about 50 Myr helps to test different planetary formation and evolution models. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, including a wide range of star-forming regions and young stellar clusters, expanding our census of the newborn planet population. In this work, we present the discovery of the TIC 88785435 planetary system located in the Upper-Centaurus Lupus (UCL) region of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) and a preliminary survey of the planet population within Sco-Cen. TIC 88785435 is a pre-main sequence, K7V dwarf ($M_\star = 0.72M_\odot$, $R_\star = 0.91R_\odot$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3998K, V = 11.7 mag) located within the bounds of UCL. We investigate the distribution of rotation periods measured from the TESS long-cadence data and the Halpha and Li abundances from the spectra of TIC 88785435. TESS long-candence data reveal that TIC 88785435 hosts a transiting super-Neptune ($R_b = 5.03R_\oplus$, P = 10.51 days), TIC 88785435 b. Ground-based follow-up validates the planetary nature of TIC 88785435 b. Using the TESS data, we perform a preliminary survey to investigate how TIC 88785435 b compares to the population of newly born planets located within Sco-Cen.</description>

      <title>Infall-driven gravitational instability in accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational instability (GI) is typically studied in cooling-dominated discs, often modelled using simplified prescriptions such as $\beta$-cooling. In this paper, we investigate the onset and evolution of GI in accretion discs subject to continuous mass injection, combining 1D and 3D numerical simulations. We explore an alternative self-regulation mechanism in which mass replenishment drives the system toward marginal stability $Q\sim 1$. In this regime, the disc establishes a steady-state disc-to-star mass ratio, balancing the mass transported to the central object with that added to the disc. Our 3D simulations reveal that the general scaling predicted from the linear theory are respected, however there are important difference compared to the cooling case in terms of morphology and pattern speed. Unlike the flocculent spirals seen in cooling-driven instability, the power is concentrated towards the dominant modes in infall-driven spirals. Additionally, spiral waves generate at the mass injection location, and propagate at constant pattern speed, unlike in the cooling case. This suggests a fundamental difference in how mass-regulated and cooling-regulated discs behave and transport angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Limits of Exoplanet Detection and Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is fundamentally impeded by the combined effect of optical diffraction and photon shot noise under extreme star-planet contrast. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet signatures by optically suppressing light from the host star while preserving light from the exoplanet. However, it is unclear whether direct imaging coronagraphs constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant to exoplanet discovery. In this work, we first review the quantum information limits of exoplanet detection and localization characterized by (1) the quantum Chernoff exponent for symmetric hypothesis testing, (2) the quantum relative entropy for asymmetric hypothesis testing, and (3) the quantum Fisher information matrix for multiparameter estimation. We demonstrate that coronagraphs designed to completely suppress light in the fundamental mode of the telescope - while perfectly transmitting higher-order orthogonal modes - indeed achieve these limits in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Furthermore, we formulate coronagraphs as quantum channels, thus generalizing the classical framework of coronography to the quantum setting. Using this framework, we compare the information-theoretic performance of leading coronagraph designs against the quantum limits. Our analysis indicates that quantum-optimal coronagraphs offer enhanced information efficiency in the sub-diffraction regime compared to leading coronagraph designs and may significantly expand the domain of accessible exoplanets.</description>
