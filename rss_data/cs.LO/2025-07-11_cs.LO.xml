      <title>A 2-categorical approach to the semantics of dependent type theory with computation axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axiomatic type theory is a dependent type theory without computation rules. The term equality judgements that usually characterise these rules are replaced by computation axioms, i.e., additional term judgements that are typed by identity types. This paper is devoted to providing an effective description of its semantics, from a higher categorical perspective: given the challenge of encoding intensional type formers into 1-dimensional categorical terms and properties, a challenge that persists even for axiomatic type formers, we adopt Richard Garner's approach in the 2-dimensional study of dependent types. We prove that the type formers of axiomatic theories can be encoded into natural 2-dimensional category theoretic data, obtaining a presentation of the semantics of axiomatic type theory via 2-categorical models called display map 2-categories. In the axiomatic case, the 2-categorical requirements identified by Garner for interpreting intensional type formers are relaxed. Therefore, we obtain a presentation of the semantics of the axiomatic theory that generalises Garner's one for the intensional case. Our main result states that the interpretation of axiomatic theories within display map 2-categories is well-defined and enjoys the soundness property. We use this fact to provide a semantic proof that the computation rule of intensional identity types is not admissible in axiomatic type theory. This is achieved via a revisitation of Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model that believes axiomatic identity types but does not believe intensional ones.</description>

      <title>Neurosymbolic Feature Extraction for Identifying Forced Labor in Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze; this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking. While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However, illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news articles related to forced labor in supply chains.</description>

      <title>On Trustworthy Rule-Based Models and Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk, the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one or more negative facets.</description>

      <title>The Richness of CSP Non-redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), a clause is called redundant if its satisfaction is implied by satisfying all other clauses. An instance of CSP$(P)$ is called non-redundant if it does not contain any redundant clause. The non-redundancy (NRD) of a predicate $P$ is the maximum number of clauses in a non-redundant instance of CSP$(P)$, as a function of the number of variables $n$. Recent progress has shown that non-redundancy is crucially linked to many other important questions in computer science and mathematics including sparsification, kernelization, query complexity, universal algebra, and extremal combinatorics. Given that non-redundancy is a nexus for many of these important problems, the central goal of this paper is to more deeply understand non-redundancy.
  Our first main result shows that for every rational number $r \ge 1$, there exists a finite CSP predicate $P$ such that the non-redundancy of $P$ is $\Theta(n^r)$. Our second main result explores the concept of conditional non-redundancy first coined by Brakensiek and Guruswami [STOC 2025]. We completely classify the conditional non-redundancy of all binary predicates (i.e., constraints on two variables) by connecting these non-redundancy problems to the structure of high-girth graphs in extremal combinatorics.
  Inspired by these concrete results, we build off the work of Carbonnel [CP 2022] to develop an algebraic theory of conditional non-redundancy. As an application of this algebraic theory, we revisit the notion of Mal'tsev embeddings, which is the most general technique known to date for establishing that a predicate has linear non-redundancy. For example, we provide the first example of predicate with a Mal'tsev embedding that cannot be attributed to the structure of an Abelian group, but rather to the structure of the quantum Pauli group.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Size-Width Tree-Like Resolution Trade-Offs for Graph Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the refutation complexity of graph isomorphism in the tree-like resolution calculus. Tor\'an and W\"orz (TOCL 2023) showed that there is a resolution refutation of narrow width $k$ for two graphs if and only if they can be distinguished in ($k+1$)-variable first-order logic (FO$^{k+1}$) and hence by a count-free variant of the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. While DAG-like narrow width $k$ resolution refutations have size at most $n^k$, tree-like refutations may be much larger. We show that there are graphs of order n, whose isomorphism can be refuted in narrow width $k$ but only in tree-like size $2^{\Omega(n^{k/2})}$. This is a supercritical trade-off where bounding one parameter (the narrow width) causes the other parameter (the size) to grow above its worst case. The size lower bound is super-exponential in the formula size and improves a related supercritical width versus tree-like size trade-off by Razborov (JACM 2016). To prove our result, we develop a new variant of the $k$-pebble EF-game for FO$^k$ to reason about tree-like refutation size in a similar way as the Prover-Delayer games in proof complexity. We analyze this game on a modified variant of the compressed CFI graphs introduced by Grohe, Lichter, Neuen, and Schweitzer (FOCS 2023). Using a recent improved robust compressed CFI construction of Janett, Nordstr\"om, and Pang (unpublished manuscript), we obtain a similar bound for width $k$ (instead of the stronger but less common narrow width) and make the result more robust.</description>

      <title>Beyond Monads and Biproducts: A Uniform Interpretation of Parallelism in Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to modelling parallelism and algebraic structure in lambda calculi often rely on monads -- as in Moggi's framework -- or on rich categorical structures such as biproducts -- as used in linear logic. In this work, we propose a minimal alternative that captures both parallelism and weighted parallelism (linear combinations) within the setting of intuitionistic propositional logic, without resorting to monads or assuming the existence of biproducts.
  We introduce two lambda calculi: a parallel lambda calculus and an algebraic lambda calculus, both extending full propositional intuitionistic logic. Their semantics are given in two categories: ${\mathbf{Mag}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are magmas and arrows are functions in $\mathbf{Set}$; and ${\mathbf{AMag}^{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are action magmas.
  The key technical challenge addressed is the interpretation of disjunction in the presence of parallel and algebraic operators. Since the usual coproduct structure is unavailable in our minimal setting, we propose a novel set-theoretic interpretation based on the union of the disjoint union and the Cartesian product. This allows for the construction of sound and adequate models for both calculi.
  Our results offer a unified and structurally lightweight framework for modelling parallelism and algebraic effects in intuitionistic logic, opening the way to alternatives beyond the traditional monadic or linear logic approaches.</description>

      <title>Modular Reasoning about Error Bounds for Concurrent Probabilistic Programs (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Coneris, the first higher-order concurrent separation logic for reasoning about error probability bounds of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order state. To support modular reasoning about concurrent (non-probabilistic) program modules, state-of-the-art program logics internalize the classic notion of linearizability within the logic through the concept of logical atomicity.
  Coneris extends this idea to probabilistic concurrent program modules. Thus Coneris supports modular reasoning about probabilistic concurrent modules by capturing a novel notion of randomized logical atomicity within the logic. To do so, Coneris utilizes presampling tapes and a novel probabilistic update modality to describe how state is changed probabilistically at linearization points. We demonstrate this approach by means of smaller synthetic examples and larger case studies.
  All of the presented results, including the meta-theory, have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Model-Checking Quantum Pushdown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18439v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of model-checking quantum pushdown systems from a computational complexity point of view. We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results:
  We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.
  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $NP$-hard. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.</description>

      <title>Deontic Temporal Logic for Formal Verification of AI Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring ethical behavior in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems amidst their increasing ubiquity and influence is a major concern the world over. The use of formal methods in AI ethics is a possible crucial approach for specifying and verifying the ethical behavior of AI systems. This paper proposes a formalization based on deontic logic to define and evaluate the ethical behavior of AI systems, focusing on system-level specifications, contributing to this important goal. It introduces axioms and theorems to capture ethical requirements related to fairness and explainability. The formalization incorporates temporal operators to reason about the ethical behavior of AI systems over time. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of this formalization by assessing the ethics of the real-world COMPAS and loan prediction AI systems. Various ethical properties of the COMPAS and loan prediction systems are encoded using deontic logical formulas, allowing the use of an automated theorem prover to verify whether these systems satisfy the defined properties. The formal verification reveals that both systems fail to fulfill certain key ethical properties related to fairness and non-discrimination, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed formalization in identifying potential ethical issues in real-world AI applications.</description>
