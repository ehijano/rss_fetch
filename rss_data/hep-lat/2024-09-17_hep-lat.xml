      <title>Supersymmetric QCD on the lattice: Fine-tuning and counterterms for the quartic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we calculate the renormalization of counterterms which arise in the lattice action of $N = 1$ Supersymmetric QCD (SQCD). In particular, the fine-tunings for quartic couplings are studied in detail through both continuum and lattice perturbation theory at one-loop level. For the lattice version of SQCD we make use of the Wilson gauge action for gluon fields and the Wilson fermion action for fermion fields (quarks, gluinos); for squark fields we use na\"ive discretization. On the lattice, different components of squark fields mix among themselves and a total of ten quartic terms arise at the quantum level. Consequently, the renormalization conditions must take into account these effects in order to appropriately fine-tune all quartic couplings. All our results for Green's functions and renormalization factors exhibit an explicit analytic dependence on the number of colors, $N_c$, the number of flavors, $N_f$, and the gauge parameter, $\alpha$, which are left unspecified. Results for the specific case $N_f=1$ are also presented, where the symmetries allow only five linearly independent quartic terms. For the calculation of the Green's functions, we consider both one-particle reducible and one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams. Knowledge of these renormalization factors is necessary in order to relate numerical results, coming from nonperturbative studies, to ``physical'' observables.</description>

      <title>Exploring Single-Flavor Dibaryons: A lattice perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice calculation of dibaryons composed of single-flavor quarks with either charm or strange quark mass. We utilize a set of lattice QCD ensembles with $N_f=2+1+1$ dynamical HISQ fields, two spatial volumes, and four different lattice spacings generated by the MILC collaboration. By using an overlap action for the valence quark propagators, we calculate the ground state energies of dibaryons in $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. By analyzing the energy difference of the ground state of the dibaryon with respect to the relevant threshold, we provide insights into the interactions involved in different spin channels at the charm and the strange quark masses.</description>

      <title>Pion-nucleon scattering with decuplet contribution in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the complete $T$ matrices with decuplet contributions for pion-nucleon scattering to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$ in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. The baryon mass in the chiral limit $M_0$ and the low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of $\pi N$, the experimental octet-baryon masses, and the value of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ simultaneously. By using these constants, we obtain the accurate $KN$ $\sigma$ terms, $\sigma_{KN}^{(1)}=(375.07\pm33.02)$ MeV and $\sigma_{KN}^{(2)}=(275.32\pm32.24)$ MeV. An excellent description of the phase shifts is obtained for all partial waves. We also present results for scattering lengths and scattering volumes. In addition, the convergence of the approach is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Insight into the nature of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and related pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of pentaquark states from different perspectives to better understand their nature, internal structure, and quantum numbers, determine their hadronization processes, and shed light on their true nature. The present study examines the magnetic moments of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and related hidden-charm pentaquark states with and without strangeness ($[d d][u c] \bar c$, $[u u][s c] \bar c$, $[dd ][s c] \bar c$, $[s s][u c] \bar c$ and $[s s][d c] \bar c$), employing a comprehensive analysis that encompasses both the compact pentaquark configuration and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. The present study compares the results regarding the magnetic moment of the $P_{c}(4457)$ pentaquark state with those reported in the existing literature. The numerical results obtained in this study, when considered alongside existing literature, indicate that the magnetic moments of hidden-charm pentaquark states may offer insights into their underlying structures, which in turn can inform the distinction between their spin-parity quantum numbers. It seems that for the future experimental search of the family of hidden-charm pentaquark states, studying the electromagnetic properties of the hidden-charm pentaquark states can provide valuable information.</description>

      <title>What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new, simple approach to the study of semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays based on the angular distributions of the final state particles only. Our approach is model independent and never requires the knowledge of $\vert V_{cb}\vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model calculations is also given for several interesting quantities. A good consistency is observed between some of the experimental results and the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Improved $\pi^0,\eta,\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors in resonance chiral theory and their $a_\mu^{\rm{HLbL}}$ contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with Resonance Chiral Theory, within the two resonance multiplets saturation scheme, we satisfy leading (and some subleading) chiral and asymptotic QCD constraints and accurately fit simultaneously the $\pi^{0},\eta,\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors, for single and double virtuality. In the latter case, we supplement the few available measurements with lattice data to ensure a faithful description. Mainly due to the new results for the doubly virtual case, we improve over existing descriptions for the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$. Our evaluation of the corresponding pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light piece of the muon $g-2$ read: $a_\mu^{\pi^{0}\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(60.4\pm0.5^{+3.2}_{-1.8}\right)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-}\mathrm{pole}}=\left(15.2\pm0.5^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\right)\times10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta^\prime\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(14.4\pm0.8^{+1.4}_{-1.0}\right)\times10^{-11}$, for a total of $a_\mu^{\pi^0+\eta+\eta^{\prime}\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(90.0\pm1.1^{+3.7}_{-2.2}\right)\times10^{-11}$, where the first and second error are the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative phase diagram of two-dimensional ${\cal N} = (2, 2)$ super-Yang--Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional ${\cal N} = (2, 2)$ Yang--Mills theory with gauge group SU($N$) in Euclidean signature compactified on a torus with thermal fermion boundary conditions imposed on one cycle. We perform non-perturbative lattice analyses of this theory for large $12 \leq N \leq 20$. Although no holographic dual of this theory is yet known, we conduct numerical investigations to check for features similar to the two-dimensional ${\cal N} = (8, 8)$ Yang--Mills theory, which has a well-defined gravity dual. We perform lattice field theory calculations to determine the phase diagram, observing a spatial deconfinement transition similar to the maximally supersymmetric case. However, the transition does not continue to low temperature, implying the absence of a topology-changing transition between black hole geometries in any holographic dual for this four-supercharge theory.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01848v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the quark mass dependence - light and heavy - of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ properties, such as, mass, coupling to $DK$, scattering lengths and compositeness, from a global analysis of $DK$ energy levels from LQCD. In particular, we analyze the HSC energy levels for $DK$ scattering in $I=0$ for different boosts and two pion masses. The formalism is based in the local hidden-gauge interaction of Weinberg-Tomozawa type which respects chiral and heavy quark spin symmetries, supplemented by a term that takes into account the $D^{(*)}K$ coupling to a bare $c\bar{s}$ component. The isospin violating decay of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)\to D_{s}^+\pi^0$ is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian Dynamics of the Open Schwinger Model: String Breaking and Kinetic Dissipation in a Thermal Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of bound state formation is one of the fundamental questions in confining quantum field theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). One hadronization mechanism that has garnered significant attention is the breaking of a string initially connecting a fermion and an anti-fermion. Deepening our understanding of real-time string-breaking dynamics with simpler, lower dimensional models like the Schwinger model can improve our understanding of the hadronization process in QCD and other confining systems found in condensed matter and statistical systems. In this paper, we consider the string-breaking dynamics within the Schwinger model and investigate its modification inside a thermal medium, treating the Schwinger model as an open quantum system coupled to a thermal environment. Within the regime of weak coupling between the system and environment, the real-time evolution of the system can be described by a Lindblad evolution equation. We analyze the Liouvillian gaps of this Lindblad equation and the time dependence of the system's von Neumann entropy. We observe that the late-time relaxation rate decreases as the environment correlation length increases. Moreover, when the environment correlation length is infinite, the system exhibits two steady states, one in each of the sectors with definite charge-conjugation-parity (CP) quantum numbers. For parameter regimes where an initial string breaks in vacuum, we observe a delay of the string breaking in the medium, due to kinetic dissipation effects. Conversely, in regimes where an initial string remains intact in vacuum time evolution, we observe string breaking (melting) in the thermal medium. We further discuss how the Liouvillian dynamics of the open Schwinger model can be simulated on quantum computers and provide an estimate of the associated Trotter errors.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances and some initial indication of particle production near the resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>
