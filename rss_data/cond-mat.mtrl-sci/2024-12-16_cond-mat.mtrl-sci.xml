      <title>Predicting Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Photovoltaic Performance from Optical Properties of Constituent Films through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a machine learning (ML) approach that accurately predicts the current-voltage behavior of 3D/2D-structured (FAMA)Pb(IBr)3/OABr hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite (HOIP) solar cells under AM1.5 illumination. Our neural network algorithm is trained on measured responses from several hundred HOIP solar cells, using three simple optical measurements of constituent HOIP films as input: optical transmission spectrum, spectrally-resolved photoluminescence, and time-resolved photoluminescence, from which we predict the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factors (FF) values of solar cells that contain the HOIP active layers. Determined average prediction accuracies for 95 % of the predicted Voc, Jsc, and FF values are 91%, 94% and 89%, respectively, with R2 coefficients of determination of 0.47, 0.77, and 0.58, respectively. Quantifying the connection between ML predictions and physical parameters extracted from the measured HOIP films optical properties, allows us to identify the most significant parameters influencing the prediction results. With separate ML-classifying algorithms, we identify degraded solar cells using the same optical input data, achieving over 90% classification accuracy through support vector machine, cross entropy loss, and artificial neural network algorithms. To our knowledge, the demonstrated regression and classification work is the first to use ML to predict device photovoltaic properties solely from the optical properties of constituent materials.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering Volterra defects: Geometrical relation between edge dislocations and wedge disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive mathematical model for Volterra defects and explores their relations using differential geometry on Riemann--Cartan manifolds. Following the standard Volterra process, we derived the Cartan moving frame, a geometric representation of plastic fields, and the associated Riemannian metric using exterior algebra. Although the analysis naturally defines the geometry of three types of dislocations and the wedge disclination, it fails to classify twist disclinations owing to the persistent torsion component, suggesting the need for modifications to the Volterra process. By leveraging the interchangeability of the Weitzenb\"ock and Levi-Civita connections and applying an analytical solution for plasticity derived from the Biot--Savart law, we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of the long-standing phenomenological relationship between edge dislocations and wedge disclinations. Additionally, we showcase the effectiveness of novel mathematical tools, including Riemannian holonomy for analysing the Frank vector and complex potentials that encapsulate the topological properties of wedge disclinations as jump discontinuities. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the linearized stress fields of wedge disclinations and confirm their consistency with existing results. These findings demonstrate that the present geometrical framework extends and generalizes the classical theory of Volterra defects.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Polarization Switching via Laser-activated Ionic Migration in Ferroelectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a layered ferroelectric material, CuInP2S6 has garnered significant attention for its robust ferroelectric state and potential applications in memory devices. In this work, we demonstrate that with short laser pulses ultrafast reversible polarization switching within hundreds of femtoseconds can be achieved in ferroelectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$. Specifically, photoexcitation triggers collective ionic migration and ferroelectricity reversal in CuInP$_2$S$_6$, revealing a novel pathway to access different ferroelectric phases through optical excitation. Our findings indicate that laser pulses substantially alter the transition barriers, promoting ionic transport facilitated by the photodoping effect. This laser-induced ionic migration proves critical for enabling polarization transitions, offering a novel pathway to explore and control exotic quantum phases. These insights open exciting possibilities for manipulating ferroelectric states and electronic properties on an unprecedented ultrafast timescale.</description>

      <title>Polarization rotation in a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ film through low-energy He-implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain engineering in ferroelectric thin films is crucial for next-generation microelectronic and photonic technologies. Here, a method is demonstrated to precisely control domain configurations in BaTiO$_3$ thin films through low-energy He ion implantation. The approach transforms a mixed ferroelectric domain state with significant in-plane polarization into a uniform out-of-plane tetragonal phase by selectively modifying the strain state in the film's top region. This structural transition significantly improves domain homogeneity and reduces polarization imprint, leading to symmetric ferroelectric switching characteristics. The demonstrated ability to manipulate ferroelectric domains post-growth enables tailored functional properties without compromising the coherently strained bottom interface. The method's compatibility with semiconductor processing and ability to selectively modify specific regions make it particularly promising for practical implementation in integrated devices. This work establishes a versatile approach for strain-mediated domain engineering that could be extended to a wide range of ferroelectric systems, providing new opportunities for memory, sensing, and photonic applications where precise control of polarization states is essential.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling and magnetization temperature dependence in cubic ferromagnetic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in spintronics have drawn renewed attention to the spin dynamics of cubic ferromagnetic crystals EuO and EuS. These ferromagnets have the simplest possible magnetic structure, making them the most suitable systems for testing various theoretical models of magnetic materials. A commonly used Wess mean-field approximation (MFA) provides only a qualitative description of magnetization temperature dependence $M(T)$. We develop a consistent theory for $M(T)$, based on the perturbation diagrammatic technique for spin operators, leading to an excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental dependence of $M(T)$ for EuO and EuS throughout the entire temperature range from $T=0$ to Curie temperature $T_{_{C}}$. In particular, our theoretical dependence $M(T)$ demonstrates an anomalous scaling behavior $ M(T)\propto (T_{_{C}}-T)^\beta$ with the scaling index $\beta\approx 1/3$ in a wide range of temperatures, in agreement with the experimentally observed scaling in EuO and EuS. This scaling index is principally different from the scaling index $\beta=1/2$ predicted by the MFA.</description>

      <title>Control of Ferrimagnetic Compensation and Perpendicular Anisotropy in Tb$_x$Co$_{(100-x)}$ with H$^{+}$ ion implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tuning of magnetic properties through electrochemical loading of hydrogen has recently attracted significant interest as a way to manipulate magnetic devices with electric fields. In this paper we investigate quantitatively the magneto-ionic effect of hydrogen uptake on the magnetic properties of rare-earth transition metal alloy Tb$_x$Co$_{(100-x)}$ in the composition range of $x=10-39$ at.\% using ion implantation. Using this technique we are able to link changes in magnetic behaviour to exact concentrations of hydrogen, isolated from the movement of any other ions that would be a factor in electrochemical studies. The composition of the alloy has been varied alongside the hydrogen dose to characterize the effect of progressive hydrogen loading on the full range of $x$ displaying out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy. We find large changes in two important properties: the compensation composition and the Co-rich in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy transition composition, both of which move by 6 at.\% towards higher Tb concentrations after hydrogen implantation. This shift in composition does not increase with a larger dose. From the changes in magnetization we attribute the change in compensation composition to a significant reduction of the moment on the Tb sublattice.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Search for Metallic Altermagnets by Embedded Dynamical Mean Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AM) are a novel class of magnetic materials with zero net magnetization but broken time-reversal symmetry and spin-split bands exceeding the spin-orbit coupling scale, offering unique control of individual spin-channel and high charge-spin conversion efficiency for spintronic applications. Still, only a few metallic altermagnets have been identified, and discovering them through trial-and-error is resource-intensive. Here, we introduce a high-throughput screening strategy to accelerate the discovery of materials with altermagnetic properties. By combining density functional theory (DFT) with embedded dynamical mean-field theory (eDMFT), our approach improves the accuracy in predicting metallicity and spin splitting, especially in transition-metal-rich compounds. An automated workflow incorporates pre-screening and symmetry analysis to reduce both human effort and computational cost. This approach identified two previously unreported metallic altermagnets, CrSe and CaFe4Al8 (in addition to two known altermagnets, CrSb and RuO2), as well as a dozen semiconducting altermagnets among over 2,000 magnetic materials. Our findings reveal that while altermagnets are abundant among magnetic materials, only a tiny fraction is metallic.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Gas-Phase Transfer and Direct Stamping of Nanomaterials: Comparison of Nanosecond and Femtosecond Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional nanomaterial, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was cleanly transferred via a blister-based laser-induced forward-transfer method. The transfer was performed utilizing femtosecond and nanosecond laser pulses for separation distances of ~16 and ~200 micrometers between a titanium donor film deposited on a glass substrate and a silicon/silicon dioxide receiver. Transfer efficiency was examined for isolated laser pulses as well as for series of overlapping pulses and single layer transfer was confirmed. It was found that hBN is transferable for all tested combinations of pulse duration and transfer distances. The results indicate that transfer proceeds via direct stamping for short donor-to-receiver distances while, for the larger distance, the material is ejected from the donor and lands on the receiver. Furthermore, with overlapping pulses, nanosecond laser pulses enable a successful printing of hBN lines while, for fs laser pulses, the Ti film can be locally disrupted by multiple pulses and molten titanium may be transferred along with the hBN flakes. For reproducibility, and to avoid contamination with metal deposits, low laser fluence transfer with ns pulses and transfer distances smaller than the blister height provide the most favourable and reproducible condition.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Geometry of Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Enabled by Magnetization Multipole of Berry Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) is a fundamental tool in magnetometry, pivotal for advancing research in optics, magnetism, and spintronics as a direct probe of magnetization. Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Bilayer orthogonal ferromagnetism in CrTe$_2$-based van der Waals system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems with pronounced spin anisotropy play a pivotal role in advancing magnetization switching and spin-wave generation mechanisms, which are fundamental for spintronic technologies. Quasi-van der Waals ferromagnets, particularly Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ compounds, represent seminal materials in this field, renowned for their delicate balance between frustrated layered geometries and magnetism. Despite extensive investigation, the precise nature of their magnetic ground state, typically described as a canted ferromagnet, remains contested, as does the mechanism governing spin reorientation under external magnetic fields and varying temperatures. In this work, we leverage a multimodal approach, integrating complementary techniques, to reveal that Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ ($\delta = 0.25 - 0.50$) hosts a previously overlooked magnetic phase, which we term orthogonal-ferromagnetism. This single phase consists of alternating atomically sharp single layers of in-plane and out-of-plane ferromagnetic blocks, coupled via exchange interactions and as such, it differs significantly from crossed magnetism, which can be achieved exclusively by stacking multiple heterostructural elements together. Contrary to earlier reports suggesting a gradual spin reorientation in CrTe$_2$-based systems, we present definitive evidence of abrupt spin-flop-like transitions. This discovery, likely due to the improved crystallinity and lower defect density in our samples, repositions Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ compounds as promising candidates for spintronic and orbitronic applications, opening new pathways for device engineering.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and electronic properties of 1D hybrid nanoobjects composed of alternating polycyclic hydrocarbon regions and double carbon chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed recently that 1D hybrid nanoobjects consisting of alternating double carbon chains and polycyclic carbon regions can be obtained from graphene nanoribbons of alternating width by electron irradiation. Here, based on density functional theory calculations, we show that magnetic and electronic properties of such nanoobjects can be changed dramatically by modifying the chain length and edge structure of polycyclic regions and this opens wide possibilities for spintronic applications. Nanoobjects composed of polycyclic regions with dangling bonds and even chains are found to behave as magnetic semiconductors that can generate spin-polarized currents. Band gaps of nanoobjects with odd chains change considerably upon switching between magnetic states making them promising for magnetic tunnel junctions. We also demonstrate that use of a hybrid exchange-correlation functional is important to properly describe stability of magnetic states, band gaps and synergistic effects of nanoobject components leading, for example, to magnetism in even chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of carrier localization on three quantities sensitive to carrier gas density at the micrometer scale: charged exciton (X+) oscillator strength, local free carrier conductivity, and the Knight shift. The last two are observed in a micrometer-scale, spatially resolved optically detected magnetic resonance experiment (ODMR). On the surface of MBE-grown (Cd,Mn)Te quantum well we identify defected areas in the vicinity of dislocations. We find that these areas show a much lower conductivity signal while maintaining the same Knight shift values as the pristine areas of the quantum well. We attribute this behavior to carrier localization in the defected regions.</description>

      <title>Large trion binding energy in monolayer WS$_2$ via strain-enhanced electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides and related layered materials in their monolayer and a few layers thicknesses regime provide a promising optoelectronic platform for exploring the excitonic- and many-body physics. Strain engineering has emerged as a potent technique for tuning the excitonic properties favorable for exciton-based devices. We have investigated the effects of nanoparticle-induced local strain on the optical properties of exciton, $X^0$, and trion, $X^\text{-}$, in monolayer WS$_2$. Biaxial tensile strain up to 2.0% was quantified and verified by monitoring the changes in three prominent Raman modes of WS$_2$: E${^1_{2g}}$($\Gamma$), A$_{1g}$, and 2LA(M). We obtained a remarkable increase of 34 meV in $X^\text{-}$ binding energy with an average tuning rate of 17.5 $\pm$ 2.5 meV/% strain across all the samples irrespective of the surrounding dielectric environment of monolayer WS$_2$ and the sample preparation conditions. At the highest tensile strain of $\approx$2%, we have achieved the largest binding energy $\approx$100 meV for $X^\text{-}$, leading to its enhanced emission intensity and thermal stability. By investigating strain-induced linewidth broadening and deformation potentials of both $X^0$ and $X^\text{-}$ emission, we elucidate that the increase in $X^\text{-}$ binding energy is due to strain-enhanced electron-phonon coupling. This work holds relevance for future $X^\text{-}$-based nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Ultra Low Velocity Ejecta Generated by Slow Impacts on Rubble Pile Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine ejecta generated by ultra low velocity impacts under asteroid conditions. In an environment of precisely controlled milligravity and under vacuum, impacts with velocities in the range of centimeters/second are performed with irregularly shaped impactors onto granular beds. The resulting ejecta velocities are compared to existing literature values and extend the observed systematic trends towards lower impact energies, broadening the parameter range. Simulations are performed to reason the systematics and the absence thereof for measurements performed at earth gravity. We find, that the cutoff induced by gravity dependent minimal observable velocities plays a crucial role in the values obtained for mean ejecta velocities.</description>

      <title>Thermomagnetic anomalies in quantum magnon transport caused by tunable junction geometries in cold atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Radical Excited States from Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emissive organic radicals are currently of great interest for their potential use in the next generation of highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices and as molecular qubits. However, simulating their optoelectronic properties is challenging, largely due to spin-contamination and the multireference character of their excited states. Here we present a data-driven approach where, for the first time, the excited electronic states of organic radicals are learned directly from experimental excited state data, using a much smaller amount of data than required by typical Machine Learning. We adopt ExROPPP, a fast and spin-pure semiempirical method for calculation of excited states of radicals, as a surrogate physical model for which we learn the optimal set of parameters. We train the model on 81 previously published radicals and find that the trained model is a huge improvement over ExROPPP with literature parameters, giving RMS and mean absolute errors of 0.24 and 0.16 eV respectively with R$^2$ and SRCC of 0.86 and 0.88 respectively. We synthesise four new radicals and validate the model on their spectra, finding even lower errors and similar correlation as for the testing set. This model paves the way for high throughput discovery of next-generation radical based optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Spin density wave and van Hove singularity in the kagome metal CeTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals with van Hove singularities (VHSs) near the Fermi level can host intriguing quantum phenomena, including chiral loop currents, electronic nematicity, and unconventional superconductivity. However, unconventional magnetic states driven by VHSs, such as spin-density waves (SDWs), have yet to be observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where the Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Our neutron diffraction measurements reveal an incommensurate SDW ground state of the Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments, which notably coexists with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by both thermal fluctuations and external magnetic fields, resulting in a rich phase diagram that includes an intermediate single-Q SDW phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements identify VHSs near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a VHS-assisted SDW in CeTi3Bi4. These findings establish the rare-earth Kagome metals LnTi3Bi4 as a model platform where characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice plays a pivotal role in magnetic order.</description>

      <title>The Wannier Function Software Ecosystem for Materials Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, following the early developments on maximally localized Wannier functions, an ecosystem of electronic-structure simulation techniques and software packages leveraging the Wannier representation has flourished. This environment includes codes to obtain Wannier functions and interfaces with first-principles simulation software, as well as an increasing number of related post-processing packages. Wannier functions can be obtained for isolated or extended systems (both crystalline and disordered), and can be used to understand chemical bonding, to characterize electric polarization, magnetization, and topology, or as an optimal basis set, providing very accurate interpolations in reciprocal space or large-scale Hamiltonians in real space. In this review, we summarize the current landscape of techniques, materials properties and simulation codes based on Wannier functions that have been made accessible to the research community, and that are now well integrated into what we term a \emph{Wannier function software ecosystem}. First, we introduce the theory and practicalities of Wannier functions, starting from their broad domains of applicability to advanced minimization methods using alternative approaches beyond maximal localization. Then we define the concept of a Wannier ecosystem and its interactions and interoperability with many quantum simulations engines and post-processing packages. We focus on some of the key properties and capabilities that are empowered by such ecosystem\textemdash from band interpolations and large-scale simulations to electronic transport, Berryology, topology, electron-phonon couplings, dynamical mean-field theory, embedding, and Koopmans functionals\textemdash concluding with the current status of interoperability and automation.

It has been established that low-temperature plastic deformation initiates martensitic phase transformations in this alloy, and the values of the dynamic modulus of elasticity correlate with the degree of phase transformations.</description>

      <title>Absence of Long-Range Magnetic Ordering in a Trirutile High-Entropy Oxide (Mn$_{0.2}$Fe$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$)Ta$_{1.92}$O$_{6-\delta}$</title>

Abstract: Functionalities of solid-state materials are usually considered to be dependent on their crystal structures. The limited structural types observed in the emerged high-entropy oxides put constraints on exploration of their physical properties and potential applications. Herein, we synthesized the first high-entropy oxide in a trirutile structure, (Mn$_{0.2}$Fe$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$)Ta$_{1.92}$O$_{6-\delta}$, and investigated its magnetism. The phase purity and high-entropy nature were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated divalent Mn, Co, Ni and Cu along with trivalent Fe. Magnetic properties measurements showed antiferromagnetic coupling and potential short-range magnetic ordering below ~ 4 K. The temperature-dependent heat capacity data measured under zero and high magnetic field confirmed the lack of long-range magnetic ordering and a possible low-temperature phonon excitation. The discovery of the first trirutile high-entropy oxide opens a new way for studying the relationship between the highly disordered atomic arrangement and their magnetic interaction. Furthermore, it provides a new direction for exploring functionalities of high-entropy oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized many fields, including materials science. However, predicting properties of crystalline materials using machine learning faces challenges in input encoding, output versatility, and interpretability. We introduce CrystalBERT, an adaptable transformer-based framework integrating space group, elemental, and unit cell information. This novel structure can seamlessly combine diverse features and accurately predict various physical properties, including topological properties, superconducting transition temperatures, dielectric constants, and more. CrystalBERT provides insightful interpretations of features influencing target properties. Our results indicate that space group and elemental information are crucial for predicting topological and superconducting properties, underscoring their intricate nature. By incorporating these features, we achieve 91\% accuracy in topological classification, surpassing prior studies and identifying previously misclassified materials. This research demonstrates that integrating diverse material information enhances the prediction of complex material properties, paving the way for more accurate and interpretable machine learning models in materials science.</description>

      <title>Exploring the relation between transonic dislocation glide and stacking fault width in FCC metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theory predicts limiting gliding velocities that dislocations cannot overcome. Computational and recent experiments have shown that these limiting velocities are soft barriers and dislocations can reach transonic speeds in high rate plastic deformation scenarios. In this paper we systematically examine the mobility of edge and screw dislocations in several face centered cubic (FCC) metals (Al, Au, Pt, and Ni) in the extreme large-applied-stress regime using MD simulations. Our results show that edge dislocations are more likely to move at transonic velocities due to their high mobility and lower limiting velocity than screw dislocations. Importantly, among the considered FCC metals, the dislocation core structure determines the dislocation's ability to reach transonic velocities. This is likely due to the variation in stacking fault width (SFW) due to relativistic effects near the limiting velocities.</description>

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof of concept of an ion source using a molten salt mixture to produce a beam of desired alkali ions like Cs$^+$ when polarized positively or oxygen complexes like NO$_3^-$ when polarized negatively. Similar to liquid metal ion sources, the ions of the salt are emitted by field evaporation from a Taylor cone formed under the influence of an intense electric field, but unlike liquid metal sources, the meniscus of the Taylor cone is not anchored on the tip of a tungsten needle but rather on the tip of a conical glass capillary containing the molten salt. We succeeded in producing a stable ion beam emission of several $\mu$A for about 50 min. We also discuss the behavior of the molten salt mixture in vacuum conditions, as to our knowledge, molten salts in vacuum conditions are not well documented in the literature, while their properties are essential to the design of the presented ion source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13759v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries have garnered significant attention as a potentially low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which have experienced supply shortages and pricing volatility of key minerals. Here we assess their techno-economic competitiveness against incumbent lithium-ion batteries using a modeling framework incorporating componential learning curves constrained by minerals prices and engineering design floors. We compare projected sodium-ion and lithium-ion price trends across over 6,000 scenarios while varying Na-ion technology development roadmaps, supply chain scenarios, market penetration, and learning rates. Assuming substantial progress can be made along technology roadmaps via targeted R&amp;D, we identify many sodium-ion pathways that might reach cost-competitiveness with low-cost lithium-ion variants in the early 2030s. Additionally, we show timelines are highly sensitive to movements in critical minerals supply chains -- namely that of lithium, graphite, and nickel. Modeled outcomes suggest increasing sodium-ion energy densities to decrease materials intensity to be among the most impactful ways to improve competitiveness.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Two-dimensional Weyl Fermions in Air-Stable Monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weyl semimetals represent a distinct category of topological materials wherein the low-energy excitations appear as the long-sought Weyl fermions. Exotic transport and optical properties are expected because of the chiral anomaly and linear energy-momentum dispersion. While three-dimensional Weyl semimetals have been successfully realized, the quest for their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts is ongoing. Here, we report the realization of 2D Weyl fermions in monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$, which has strong spin-orbit coupling and lacks inversion symmetry, by combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, second harmonic generation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and first-principles calculations. The giant Rashba splitting and band inversion lead to the emergence of three pairs of critical Weyl cones. Moreover, monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$ exhibits excellent chemical stability in ambient conditions, which is critical for future device applications. The discovery of 2D Weyl fermions in monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$ opens up new possibilities for designing and fabricating novel spintronic devices.</description>
