      <title>Gaussian integrals on symmetric spaces (the complex case and beyond)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is concerned with Gaussian integrals on simply-connected non-positively-curved Riemannian symmetric spaces. It is motivated by the aim of explicitly finding the high-rank limit of these integrals for each of the eleven families of classical Riemannian symmetric spaces. To begin, it deals with the easier complex case (where the isometry group admits a complex Lie group structure). To go beyond this case, it introduces a variational characterisation of the high-rank limit, as the minimum of a certain energy functional over the space of probability distributions on the real line. Using this new variational formulation, it is possible to recover the high-rank limit in closed form, from the expression originally found in the complex case. This two-step approach is illustrated through the examples of two kinds of symmetric spaces : symmetric cones and classical symmetric domains.</description>

      <title>Moderately Heavy Extremes under Long Range Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stationary sequences whose marginal tail is subexponential and lies in the Gumbel Maximum domain of attraction. Due to the extremely strong dependence, their extreme values are caused by multiple big values and are clustered in the large scale with fractal features. We establish functional extremal limit theorems with non-Gumbel limit objects to characterize these delicate phenomena.</description>

      <title>The intertwining property for $\beta $-Laguerre processes and integral operators for Jack polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study intertwining relations for Laguerre process with inverse temperature $\beta \ge 1$ and parameter $\alpha &gt;-1$. We introduce a Markov kernel that depends on both $\beta $ and $ \alpha $, and establish new intertwining relations for the $\beta$-Laguerre processes using this kernel. A key observation is that Jack symmetric polynomials are eigenfunctions of our Markov kernel, which allows us to apply a method established by Ramanan and Shkolnikov. Additionally, as a by-product, we derive an integral formula for multivariate Laguerre polynomials and multivariate hypergeometric functions associated with Jack polynomials.</description>

      <title>Random Field Representations of Kernel Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive semi-definite kernels are used to induce pseudo-metrics, or ``distances'', between measures. We write these as an expected quadratic variation of, or expected inner product between, a random field and the difference of measures. This alternate viewpoint offers important intuition and interesting connections to existing forms. Metric distances leading to convenient finite sample estimates are shown to be induced by fields with dense support, stationary increments, and scale invariance. The main example of this is energy distance. We show that the common generalization preserving continuity is induced by fractional Brownian motion. We induce an alternate generalization with the Gaussian free field, formally extending the Cram\'er-von Mises distance. Pathwise properties give intuition about practical aspects of each. This is demonstrated through signal to noise ratio studies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviour of plane partitions distributed according to a weighted $q^{Volume}$ Muttalib--Borodin ensemble. Specifically, we establish a Large Deviation principle for the discrete Muttalib--Borodin process, characterising the rate function. Furthermore, through Riemann--Hilbert analysis, we give an explicit expression for the asymptotic shape of the partition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider discrete-time D-BMAP/G/\inf queueing model. We construct effective discrete-time Markovian dynamics for this model and utilize it to derive exact time-dependent distribution of customer number and the corresponding moments for the original queueing model. Numerical simulations are used to verify our results. Using our result, we provide analytical distribution for discrete-time M/M/\inf, and then compare it with the distribution of continuous-time M/M/\inf.</description>

      <title>Non-convex entropic mean-field optimization via Best Response flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of its unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Smoothed Scores for Denoising Diffusion: A Bias-Variance Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling, yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization. Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic and MNIST datasets.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity and decompositions of random regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we establish several monotonicity and decomposition results in the framework of random regular graphs. Among other results, we show that, for a wide range of parameters $d_1 \leq d_2$, there exists a coupling of $G(n,d_1)$ and $G(n,d_2)$ satisfying that $G(n,d_1) \subseteq G(n,d_2)$ with high probability, confirming a conjecture of Gao, Isaev and McKay in a new regime. Our contributions include new tools for analysing contiguity and total variation distance between random regular graph models, a novel procedure for generating unions of random edge-disjoint perfect matchings, and refined estimates of Gao's bounds on the number of perfect matchings in random regular graphs. In addition, we make progress towards another conjecture of Isaev, McKay, Southwell and Zhukovskii.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastic systems with almost surely invariant manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for establishing non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastically forced dynamical systems possessing an almost surely invariant submanifold. Our main abstract result provides sufficient conditions for the existence of multiple stationary measures on compact manifolds, though the underlying methodology extends to non-compact settings. The key insight is to construct additional stationary measures by exploiting the linear instability of the invariant submanifold, as quantified by a positive transverse Lyapunov exponent.
  To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we apply it to the Lorenz 96 model with degenerate stochastic forcing, which serves as an example of both non-compact and high-dimensional dynamics. We prove that as the damping parameter becomes sufficiently small, the unique stationary measure bifurcates, giving rise to exactly two distinct stationary measures. The proof combines our general theory with computer-assisted verification of certain Lie algebra generation properties that ensure the required hypoellipticity and irreducibility conditions.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Games with two-sided singular controls for L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a probabilistic mean field game driven by a L\'evy process an individual player aims to minimize a long run discounted/ergodic cost by controlling the process through a pair of increasing and decreasing c\`adl\`ag processes, while he is interacting with an aggregate of players through the expectation of a controlled process by another pair of c\`adl\`ag processes. With the Brouwer fixed point theorem, we provide easy to check conditions for the existence of mean field game equilibrium controls for both the discounted and ergodic control problem, characterize them as the solution of an integro-differential equation and show with a counterexample that uniqueness does not always holds. Furthermore, we study the convergence of equilibrium controls in the abelian sense. Finally, we treat the convergence of a finite-player game to this problem to justify our approach.</description>

      <title>Algebraic aspects of the polynomial Littlewood-Offord problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a degree-$d$ polynomial $f(\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n)$ of independent Rademacher random variables $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n$. To what extent can $f(\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n)$ concentrate on a single point? This is the so-called polynomial Littlewood-Offord problem. A nearly optimal bound was proved by Meka, Nguyen and Vu: the point probabilities are always at most about $1/\sqrt n$, unless $f$ is "close to the zero polynomial" (having only $o(n^d)$ nonzero coefficients).
  In this paper we prove several results supporting the general philosophy that the Meka-Nguyen-Vu bound can be significantly improved unless $f$ is "close to a polynomial with special algebraic structure", drawing some comparisons to phenomena in analytic number theory. In particular, one of our results is a corrected version of a conjecture of Costello on multilinear forms (in an appendix with Ashwin Sah and Mehtaab Sawhney, we disprove Costello's original conjecture).</description>

Abstract: We show that there exist constants $\delta_1,\delta_2&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph with $\lambda/d\le\delta_1$, then $G$ contains an induced cycle of length at least $\delta_2n/d$. We further demonstrate that, up to a constant factor, this is best possible. Utilising our techniques, we derive that the number of non-isomorphic induced subgraphs of such $G$ is at least exponential in $n\log d/d$, and further demonstrate that this is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Control with Poissonian Common Noise: A Pathwise Compactification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the compactification approach to tackle mean-field control (MFC) problems with Poissonian common noise. To overcome the lack of compactness and continuity issues due to common noise, we exploit the point process representation of the Poisson random measure with finite intensity and propose a pathwise formulation by freezing a sample path of the common noise. We first study a pathwise relaxed control problem in an auxiliary setup without common noise but with finite deterministic jumping times over the finite horizon. By employing the compactification argument for the pathwise relaxed control problem with Skorokhod topology, we establish the existence of optimal controls in the pathwise formulation. To address the original problem, the main challenge is to close the gap between the problem in the original model with common noise and the pathwise formulation. With the help of concatenation techniques over the sequence of deterministic jumping times, we develop a new tool, also interpreted as the superposition principle in the pathwise formulation, to draw a relationship between the pathwise relaxed control problem and the pathwise measure-valued control problem associated to Fokker-Planck equation. As a result, we can bridge the desired equivalence among different problem formulations. We also extend the methodology to solve mean-field games with Poissonian common noise, confirming the existence of a strong mean field equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: This article establishes cutoff convergence or abrupt convergence of three statistical quantities for multivariate (Hurwitz) stable geometric Brownian motion: the autocorrelation function, the Wasserstein distance between the current state and its degenerate limiting measure, and, finally, anti-concentration probabilities, which yield a fine-tuned trade-off between almost sure rates and the respective integrability of the random modulus of convergence using a quantitative Borel--Cantelli Lemma. We obtain in case of simultaneous diagonalizable drift and volatility matrices a complete representation of the mean square and derive nontrivial, sufficient and necessary mean square stability conditions, which include all real and imaginary parts of the volatility matrices' spectra.</description>

Abstract: By employing a suitable multiplicative It\^o noise with radial structure and with more than linear growth, we show the existence of a unique, global-in-time, strong solution for the stochastic Euler equations in two and three dimensions. More generally, we consider a class of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with a superlinear growth drift and suitable nonlinear, multiplicative It\^o noise, with the stochastic Euler equations as a special case within this class. We prove that the addition of such a noise effectively prevents blow-ups in the solution of these SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Fluid limits for interacting queues in sparse dynamic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a network of $n$ single-server queues where tasks arrive independently at each server at rate $\lambda_n$. The servers are connected by a graph that is resampled at rate $\mu_n$ in a way that is symmetric with respect to the servers, and each task is dispatched to the shortest queue in the graph neighborhood where it appears. We aim to gain insight in the impact of the dynamic network structure on the load balancing dynamics in terms of the occupancy process which describes the empirical distribution of the number of tasks across the servers. This process evolves on the underlying dynamic graph, and its dynamics depend on the the number of tasks at each individual server and the neighborhood structure of the graph. We establish that this dependency disappears in the limit as $n \to \infty$ when $\lambda_n / n \to \lambda$ and $\mu_n \to \infty$, and prove that the limit of the occupancy process is given by a system of differential equations that depends solely on $\lambda$ and the limiting degree distribution of the graph. We further show that the stationary distribution of the occupancy process converges to an equilibrium of the differential equations, and derive properties of this equilibrium that reflect the impact of the degree distribution. Our focus is on truly sparse graphs where the maximum degree is uniformly bounded across $n$, which is natural in load balancing systems.</description>

      <title>Contagious McKean--Vlasov problems with common noise: from smooth to singular feedback through hitting times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of McKean--Vlasov equations arising as the large particle limit of a system of interacting particles on the positive half-line with common noise and feedback. Such systems are motivated by structural models for systemic risk with contagion. This contagious interaction is such that when a particle hits zero, the impact is to move all the others toward the origin through a kernel which smooths the impact over time. We study a rescaling of the impact kernel under which it converges to the Dirac delta function so that the interaction happens instantaneously and the limiting singular McKean--Vlasov equation can exhibit jumps. Our approach provides a novel method to construct solutions to such singular problems that allows for more general drift and diffusion coefficients and we establish weak convergence to relaxed solutions in this setting. With more restrictions on the coefficients we can establish an almost sure version showing convergence to strong solutions. Under some regularity conditions on the contagion, we also show a rate of convergence up to the time the regularity of the contagion breaks down. Lastly, we perform some numerical experiments to investigate the sharpness of our bounds for the rate of convergence.</description>

Abstract: In the classical model of random recursive trees, trees are recursively built by attaching new vertices to old ones. What happens if vertices are allowed to freeze, in the sense that new vertices cannot be attached to already frozen ones? We are interested in the impact of freezing on the height of such trees.</description>

      <title>Area measures and branched polymers in supercritical Liouville quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) phase, which has background charge $Q \in (0,2)$ and central charge $\mathbf{c}_{\mathrm{L}} = 1+6Q^2 \in (1,25)$. Recent works have shown how to define LQG in this phase as a planar random geometry associated with a variant of the Gaussian free field, which exhibits "infinite spikes." In contrast, a number of results from physics, dating back to the 1980s, suggest that supercritical LQG surfaces should behave like "branched polymers": i.e., they should look like the continuum random tree. We prove a result which reconciles these two descriptions of supercritical LQG. More precisely, we show that for a family of random planar maps with boundary in the universality class of supercritical LQG, if we condition on the (small probability) event that the planar map is finite, then the scaling limit is the continuum random tree. We also show that there does not exist any locally finite measure associated with supercritical LQG which is locally determined by the field and satisfies the LQG coordinate change formula. Our proofs are based on a branching process description of supercritical LQG which comes from its coupling with CLE$_4$ (Ang and Gwynne, arXiv:2308.11832).</description>

      <title>Convergence of the QuickVal Residual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QuickSelect (aka Find), introduced by Hoare (1961), is a randomized algorithm for selecting a specified order statistic from an input sequence of $n$ objects, or rather their identifying labels usually known as keys. The keys can be numeric or symbol strings, or indeed any labels drawn from a given linearly ordered set. We discuss various ways in which the cost of comparing two keys can be measured, and we can measure the efficiency of the algorithm by the total cost of such comparisons.
  We define and discuss a closely related algorithm known as QuickVal and a natural probabilistic model for the input to this algorithm; QuickVal searches (almost surely unsuccessfully) for a specified population quantile $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ in an input sample of size $n$. Call the total cost of comparisons for this algorithm $S_n$. We discuss a natural way to define the random variables $S_1, S_2, \ldots$ on a common probability space. For a general class of cost functions, Fill and Nakama (2013) proved under mild assumptions that the scaled cost $S_n / n$ of QuickVal converges in $L^p$ and almost surely to a limit random variable $S$. For a general cost function, we consider what we term the QuickVal residual: \[\rho_n := \frac{S_n}n - S.\] The residual is of natural interest, especially in light of the previous analogous work on the sorting algorithm QuickSort. In the case $\alpha = 0$ of QuickMin with unit cost per key-comparison, we are able to calculate -- \`a la Bindjeme and Fill (2012) for QuickSort -- the exact (and asymptotic) $L^2$-norm of the residual. We take the result as motivation for the scaling factor $\sqrt{n}$ for the QuickVal residual for general population quantiles and for general cost. We then prove in general (under mild conditions on the cost function) that $\sqrt{n}\,\rho_n$ converges in law to a scale-mixture of centered Gaussians, and we also prove convergence of moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this first of two articles, we study the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems with parameter $\kappa &gt; 0$ -- a family of random multi-curve systems in a simply-connected domain $\Omega$, with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$. As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that such systems are characterized by equivalence classes of partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, one can always choose a conformally covariant representative. When the marked interior point $q$ is set at the origin, we demonstrate that the partition function satisfies a system of second-order PDEs, known as the null vector equations, with a null vector constant $h$ and a rotation equation involving a constant $\omega$. Motivated by the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct four families of solutions to the null vector equations, which are naturally classified according to topological link patterns. For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the states built upon the fermionic states.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Young diagrams for symplectic groups and semiclassical orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an $n\times k$ matrix of i.i.d. Bernoulli random numbers with $p=1/2$. Dual RSK algorithm gives a bijection of this matrix to a pair of Young tableaux of conjugate shape, which is manifestation of skew Howe $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-duality. Thus the probability measure on zero-ones matrix leads to the probability measure on Young diagrams proportional to the ratio of the dimension of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-representation and the dimension of the exterior algebra $\bigwedge\left(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{k}\right)$.
  Similarly, by applying Proctor's algorithm based on Berele's modification of the Schensted insertion, we get skew Howe duality for the pairs of groups $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$. In the limit when $n,k\to\infty$ $GL$-case is relatively easily studied by use of free-fermionic representation for the correlation kernel. But for the symplectic groups there is no convenient free-fermionic representation. We use Christoffel transformation to obtain the semiclassical orthogonal polynomials for $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$ from Krawtchouk polynomials that describe $GL_{2n}\times GL_{2k}$ case. We derive an integral representation for semiclassical polynomials. The study of the asymptotic of this integral representation gives us the description of the limit shapes and fluctuations of the random Young diagrams for symplectic groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiple chordal SLE$(\kappa)$ systems in a simply connected domain $\Omega$, where $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ are boundary starting points, and $q \in \partial \Omega$ is an additional marked boundary point.
  Based on the framework introduced in \cite{Dub07}, we show that the partition functions in the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$ satisfy both the null vector equations and a dilatation equation with scaling constant $d$.
  We show that the presence of the marked boundary point $q$ introduces a natural equivalence relation among partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, a conformally covariant representative can always be chosen.
  Using techniques from the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct two distinct families of solutions, each indexed by a topological link pattern of type $(n,m)$, where $2m \leq n$.
  In the special case where $\Omega = \mathbb{H}$ and $q = \infty$, we demonstrate that these partition functions correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Moser system, extending the known correspondence beyond the standard $(2n,n)$ setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probability that a zero of a random real polynomial of increasing degree is real tends to zero. However, passing from polynomials to Laurent polynomials yields a surprising result: the probability that a root is real tends not to zero, but to $1/\sqrt{3}$. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for systems of Laurent polynomials in several variables. By considering Laurent polynomials as functions associated with torus representations, we describe an analogous phenomenon for representations of any reductive linear group. In the case of a simple group, we provide a formula for the aforementioned limiting probability.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms (complex generalized H\'{e}non maps and their conjugate maps) of $\Bbb{C}^{2}.$ We show that a generic random dynamical system of polynomial automorphisms has ``mean stablity'' on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$. Further, we show that if a system has mean stability, then (1) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma =(\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ of maps, the maximal Lyapunov exponents of $\gamma $ at $z$ is negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of the system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, (4) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\{ \gamma _{n}\cdots \gamma _{1}(z) \} _{n=1}^{\infty }$ tends to one of the minimal sets of the system, and (5) the transition operator of the system has the spectrum gap property on the space of Hoelder continuous functions with some exponent. Note that none of (1)--(5) can hold for any deterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized H\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms of $\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We provide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random holomorphic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'e inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in \textit{any} normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'e constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'e constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call \emph{long range expansion}, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends \emph{polynomially} on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space with an unconditional basis which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Heavy-traffic Optimality of Skip-the-Longest-Queues in Heterogeneous Service Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time parallel service system consisting of $n$ heterogeneous single server queues with infinite capacity. Jobs arrive to the system as an i.i.d. process with rate proportional to $n$, and must be immediately dispatched in the time slot that they arrive. The dispatcher is assumed to be able to exchange messages with the servers to obtain their queue lengths and make dispatching decisions, introducing an undesirable communication overhead. In this setting, we propose a ultra-low communication overhead load balancing policy dubbed $k$-Skip-the-$d$-Longest-Queues ($k$-SLQ-$d$), where queue lengths are only observed every $k(n-d)$ time slots and, between observations, incoming jobs are sent to a queue that is not one of the $d$ longest ones at the time that the queues were last observed. For this policy, we establish conditions on $d$ for it to be throughput optimal and we show that, under that condition, it is asymptotically delay-optimal in heavy-traffic for arbitrarily low communication overheads (i.e., for arbitrarily large $k$).</description>
