      <title>Multiple chordal SLE(0) and classical Calogero-Moser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems of type $(n, m)$ for positive integers $n$ and $m$ with $m \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$, extending the construction of~\cite{ABKM20} beyond the previously studied case $n = 2m$.
  By applying integrals of motion associated with the Loewner evolution, we show that, in the $\mathbb{H}$-uniformization with the marked point $q = \infty$, the traces of type $(n, m)$ multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems correspond to the real locus of real rational functions with $n$ real simple critical points, $m$ simple poles, and a pole of order $n - 2m + 1$ at infinity.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that, under a common capacity parametrization, the Loewner dynamics evolve according to the classical Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{L}_{q}$-maximal inequality for high dimensional means under dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an $\mathcal{L}_{q}$-maximal inequality for zero mean dependent random variables $\{x_{t}\}_{t=1}^{n}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{p}$, where $p$ $&gt;&gt;$ $% n $ is allowed. The upper bound is a familiar multiple of $\ln (p)$ and an $% l_{\infty }$ moment, as well as Kolmogorov distances based on Gaussian approximations $(\rho _{n},\tilde{\rho}_{n})$, derived with and without negligible truncation and sub-sample blocking. The latter arise due to a departure from independence and therefore a departure from standard symmetrization arguments. Examples are provided demonstrating $(\rho _{n},% \tilde{\rho}_{n})$ $\rightarrow $ $0$ under heterogeneous mixing and physical dependence conditions, where $(\rho _{n},\tilde{\rho}_{n})$ are multiples of $\ln (p)/n^{b}$ for some $b$ $&gt;$ $0$ that depends on memory, tail decay, the truncation level and block size.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matchings on Doubly Free Boundary Rail-Yard Graph with Macdonald Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of perfect matchings on rail-yard graphs with doubly free boundary conditions and Jack weights. While a special case of this model reduces to the half space Macdonald process with Jack weights introduced by Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin [3], the asymptotic behavior in the general Jack-weighted free boundary setting considered here has, to our knowledge, remained open in the literature; perhaps due to the absence of determinantal structure and the analytic complexity of boundary interactions that distinguish this setting from previously tractable cases. Our analysis is inspired by the asymptotic framework developed around the Negut operator by Gorin, Zhang, and Ahn, but it is adapted in new directions to address the challenges posed by the fully free boundary Jack-weighted regime. In particular, we establish novel identities for Macdonald polynomials and analyze infinite-product expansions not previously studied in this context. These tools enable us to rigorously establish the existence of a limit shape and to prove that the height fluctuations converge to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF) in the liquid region. These results, to the best of our knowledge, provide the first rigorous limit shape and fluctuation analysis in Jack-weighted tiling models with general free boundary conditions. In doing so, we expand the asymptotic theory of symmetric-function-deformed models beyond previously accessible, determinantal frameworks.</description>

      <title>Household epidemic models revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a generalized stochastic household epidemic model defined by a bivariate random variable $(X_G, X_L)$, representing the number of global and local infectious contacts that an infectious individual makes during their infectious period. Each global contact is selected uniformly among all individuals and each local contact is selected uniformly among all other household members. The main focus is when all households have the same size $h \geq 2$, and the number of households is large. Large population properties of the model are derived including a central limit theorem for the final size of a major epidemic, the proof of which utilises an enhanced embedding argument. A modification of the epidemic model is considered where local contacts are replaced by global contacts independently with probability $p$. We then prove monotonicity results for the probability of the major outbreak and the limiting final fraction infected $z$ (conditioned on a major outbreak). a) The probability of a major outbreak is shown to be increasing in both $h$ and $p$ for any distribution of $X_L$. b) The final size $z$ increases monotonically with both $h$ and $p$ if the probability generating function (pgf) of $X_L$ is log-convex, which is satisfied by traditional household epidemic models where $X_L$ has a mixed-Poisson distribution. Additionally, we provide counter examples to b) when the pgf of $X_L$ is not log-convex.</description>

      <title>A multi-season epidemic model with random genetic drift and transmissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for an influenza-like disease, in which, between seasons, the virus makes a random genetic drift $\delta$, (reducing immunity by the factor $\delta$) and obtains a new random transmissibility $\tau$ (closely related to $R_0$). Given the immunity status at the start of season $k$: $\textbf{p}^{(k)}$, describing community distribution of years since last infection, and their associated immunity levels $\boldsymbol{\iota}^{(k)}$, the outcome of the epidemic season $k$, characterized by the effective reproduction number $R_e^{(k)}$ and the fractions infected in the different immunity groups $\textbf{z}^{(k)}$, is determined by the random pair $(\delta_k, \tau_k)$. It is shown that the immunity status $(\textbf{p}^{(k)}, \boldsymbol{\iota}^{(k)})$, is an ergodic Markov chain, which converges to a stationary distribution $\bar \pi (\cdot) $. More analytical progress is made for the case where immunity only lasts for one season. We then characterize the stationary distribution of $p_1^{(k)}$, being identical to $z^{(k-1)}$. Further, we also characterize the stationary distribution of $(R_e^{(k)}, z^{(k)})$, and the conditional distribution of $z^{(k)}$ given $R_e^{(k)}$. The effective reproduction number $R_e^{(k)}$ is closely related to the initial exponential growth rate $\rho^{(k)}$ of the outbreak, a quantity which can be estimated early in the epidemic season. As a consequence, this conditional distribution may be used for predicting the final size of the epidemic based on its initial growth and immunity status.</description>

      <title>Precompactness of sequences of random variables and random curves revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies when a sequence $(\mu_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ of probability measures on a metric space $(\mathcal X, d)$ admit subsequential weak limits. A sufficient condition called sequential tightness is formulated, which relaxes some assumptions for asymptotic tightness used in the Prokhorov -- Le Cam theorem. In the case where $\mathcal X$ is a compact geodesic metric space, sequential tightness gives means to characterize precompactness of collections of random curves on $\mathcal X$ in terms of an annulus crossing condition, which generalizes the one by Aizenman and Burchard by allowing estimates for annulus crossing probabilities to be non-uniform over the modulus of annuli.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Neural SDEs Using Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical, control theory inspired method for variational inference (VI) for neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). While VI for neural SDEs is a promising avenue for uncertainty-aware reasoning in time-series, it is computationally challenging due to the iterative nature of maximizing the ELBO. In this work, we propose to decompose the control term into linear and residual non-linear components and derive an optimal control term for linear SDEs, using stochastic optimal control. Modeling the non-linear component by a neural network, we show how to efficiently train neural SDEs without sacrificing their expressive power. Since the linear part of the control term is optimal and does not need to be learned, the training is initialized at a lower cost and we observe faster convergence.</description>

      <title>Liouville PDE-based sliced-Wasserstein flow for fair regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein flow (SWF), a nonparametric and implicit generative gradient flow, is applied to fair regression. We have improved the SWF in a few aspects. First, the stochastic diffusive term from the Fokker-Planck equation-based Monte Carlo is transformed to Liouville partial differential equation (PDE)-based transport with density estimation, however, without the diffusive term. Now, the computation of the Wasserstein barycenter is approximated by the SWF barycenter with the prescription of Kantorovich potentials for the induced gradient flow to generate its samples. These two efforts improve the convergence in training and testing SWF and SWF barycenters with reduced variance. Applying the generative SWF barycenter for fair regression demonstrates competent profiles in the accuracy-fairness Pareto curves.</description>

      <title>A new measure of dependence: Integrated $R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new measure of dependence that quantifies the degree to which a random variable $Y$ depends on a random vector $X$. This measure is zero if and only if $Y$ and $X$ are independent, and equals one if and only if $Y$ is a measurable function of $X$. We introduce a simple and interpretable estimator that is comparable in ease of computation to classical correlation coefficients such as Pearson's, Spearman's, or Chatterjee's. Building on this coefficient, we develop a model-free variable selection algorithm, feature ordering by dependence (FORD), inspired by FOCI. FORD requires no tuning parameters and is provably consistent under suitable sparsity assumptions. We demonstrate its effectiveness and improvements over FOCI through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Harnack Inequalities and Ergodicity of Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equation in $L^p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.01335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Harnack inequalities for a stochastic reaction-diffusion equation with dissipative drift driven by additive irregular noise in the $L^p$-space for any $p \ge 2$. These inequalities are utilized to investigate the ergodicity of the corresponding Markov semigroup $(P_t)$. The main ingredient of our method is a coupling by the change of measure. Applying our results to the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation with a super-linear growth drift having a negative leading coefficient, perturbed by a Lipschitz term, indicates that $(P_t)$ possesses a unique and thus ergodic invariant measure in $L^p$ for all $p \ge 2$, which is independent of the Lipschitz term.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of the n-th Degree Bounded Stochastic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07474v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a novel characterization of the $n$th degree bounded stochastic dominance (BSD) order, linking it to the risk tolerance of decision makers and
  providing a decision theoretic foundation for these stochastic orders. Our results reveal two contrasting implications, on the positive side, they show that BSD reflects specific risk preferences through the choice of the interval $[a,b]$, by characterizing it in terms of utility functions with globally bounded Arrow Pratt risk aversion or that satisfy an $n$ convexity condition. On the negative side, they highlight limitations of BSD, including the dependence of BSD on the chosen interval and the peculiar risk aversion behavior of decision-makers included in the generator of BSD. We illustrate our results through a portfolio optimization model with stochastic dominance constraints. Additionally, using our characterization, we present comparative statics results for decision making under uncertainty with globally bounded risk aversion measures and savings decisions under globally bounded prudence measures, and derive inequalities for $n$ convex functions.</description>

      <title>Existence and higher regularity of statistically steady states for the stochastic Coleman-Gurtin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of semi-linear differential Volterra equations with polynomial-type potentials that incorporates the effects of memory while being subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. We show that for a broad class of non-linear potentials, the system always admits invariant probability measures. However, the presence of memory effects precludes access to compactness in a typical fashion. In this paper, this obstacle is overcome by introducing functional spaces adapted to the memory kernels, thereby allowing one to recover compactness. Under the assumption of sufficiently smooth noise, it is then shown that the statistically stationary states possess higher-order regularity properties dictated by the structure of the nonlinearity. This is established through a control argument that asymptotically transfers regularity onto the solution by exploiting the underlying Lyapunov structure of the system in a novel way.</description>

      <title>Emergence of microbial host dormancy during a persistent virus epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a minimal stochastic individual-based model for a microbial population challenged by a persistent (lytic) virus epidemic. We focus on the situation in which the resident microbial host population and the virus population are in stable coexistence upon arrival of a single new ``mutant'' host individual. We assume that this mutant is capable of switching to a reversible state of dormancy upon contact with virions as a means of avoiding infection by the virus. At the same time, we assume that this new dormancy trait comes with a cost, namely a reduced individual reproduction rate. We prove that there is a non-trivial range of parameters where the mutants can nevertheless invade the resident population with strictly positive probability (bounded away from 0) in the large population limit. Given the reduced reproductive rate, such an invasion would be impossible in the absence of either the dormancy trait or the virus epidemic. We explicitly characterize the parameter regime where this emergence of a (costly) host dormancy trait is possible, determine the success probability of a single invader and the typical amount of time it takes the successful mutants to reach a macroscopic population size. We conclude this study by an investigation of the fate of the population after the successful emergence of a dormancy trait. Heuristic arguments and simulations suggest that after successful invasion, either both host types and the virus will reach coexistence, or the mutants will drive the resident hosts to extinction while the virus will stay in the system.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality of Projected Inventory Level Policies for Lost Sales Inventory Systems with Large Leadtime and Penalty Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the canonical periodic review lost sales inventory system with positive leadtime and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) demand under the average cost criterion. We demonstrate that the relative value function under the constant order policy satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equation. We employ ladder processes associated with a random walk featuring i.i.d. increments, to obtain an explicit solution for the relative value function. This solution can be expressed as a quadratic form and a term that grows sublinearly. Then we perform an approximate policy iteration step on the constant order policy and bound the approximation errors as a function of the cost of losing a sale. This leads to our main result that projected inventory level policies are asymptotically optimal as the leadtime grows when the cost of losing a sale is sufficiently large and demand has a finite second moment.</description>

      <title>On the optimal stopping of Gauss-Markov bridges with random pinning points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the optimal stopping problem for a Gauss-Markov process conditioned to adopt a prescribed terminal distribution. By applying a time-space transformation, we show it is equivalent to stopping a Brownian bridge pinned at a random endpoint with a time-dependent payoff. We prove that the optimal rule is the first entry into the stopping region, and establish that the value function is Lipschitz continuous on compacts via a coupling of terminal pinning points across different initial conditions. A comparison theorems then order value functions according to likelihood-ratio ordering of terminal densities, and when these densities have bounded support, we bound the optimal boundary by that of a Gauss-Markov bridge. Although the stopping boundary need not be the graph of a function in general, we provide sufficient conditions under which this property holds, and identify strongly log-concave terminal densities that guarantee this structure. Numerical experiments illustrate representative boundary shapes.</description>

      <title>Top of the spectrum of discrete Anderson Hamiltonians with correlated Gaussian potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the top of the spectrum of discrete Anderson Hamiltonians with correlated Gaussian noise in the large volume limit. The class of Gaussian noises under consideration allows for long-range correlations. We show that the largest eigenvalues converge to a Poisson point process and we obtain a very precise description of the associated eigenfunctions near their localisation centres. We also relate these localisation centres with the locations of the maxima of the noise. Actually, our analysis reveals that this relationship depends in a subtle way on the behaviour near $0$ of the covariance function of the noise: in some situations, the largest eigenfunctions are not associated with the largest values of the noise.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for Hausdorff and packing dimensions of fractal percolation on self-affine sponges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Bara\'nski and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpi\'nski sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur Model with Internal Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a stochastic version of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model solely driven by internal demographic noise, extending classical Lotka-Volterra-type systems focused on external noise. We give a criterion for the existence and uniqueness of autonomous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on an open submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and the framework allows for a wider choice of Lyapunov functions. In the meantime, the invariance of open submanifolds, which is a biologically feasible result and has been implicitly incorporated into many biological and ecological models, facilitates the application of analytic tools typically suited to $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and indicates the persistence of predator and prey populations, thus providing a criterion for determining whether a population will become extinct. We apply the well-posedness criterion to our stochastic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model and show the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Furthermore, the asymptotic estimates of solutions are obtained, indicating the at most exponential growth of the population with internal stochasticity. Some numerical experiments are performed, which illustrate the discrepancy between the deterministic and stochastic models. Overall, this work demonstrates the broad applicability of our results to ecological models with constrained dynamics, offering a foundation for analyzing extinction, persistence, and well-posedness in systems where internal randomness dominates. This paper not only promotes the development of stochastic modeling and stochastic differential equations in theoretical ecology but also proposes a rigorous mathematical methodology for studying the predator-prey system with internal stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse optimal control of random elliptic variational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a risk-averse optimal control problem governed by an elliptic variational inequality (VI) subject to random inputs. By deriving KKT-type optimality conditions for a penalised and smoothed problem and studying convergence of the stationary points with respect to the penalisation parameter, we obtain two forms of stationarity conditions. The lack of regularity with respect to the uncertain parameters and complexities induced by the presence of the risk measure give rise to new challenges unique to the stochastic setting. We also propose a path-following stochastic approximation algorithm using variance reduction techniques and demonstrate the algorithm on a modified benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Importance Corrected Neural JKO Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.</description>

      <title>Free denoising via overlap measures and c-freeness techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of free denoising. For free selfadjoint random variables $a,b$, where we interpret $a$ as a signal and $b$ as noise, we find $E(a|a+b)$. To that end, we study a probability measure $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ which we call the overlap measure. We show that $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the product measure $\mu_a\times \mu_{a+b}$. The Radon-Nikodym derivative gives direct access to $E(a|a+b)$. We show that analogous results hold in the case of multiplicative noise when $a,b$ are positive and the aim is to find $E(a|a^{1/2}ba^{1/2})$. In a parallel development we show that, for a general selfadjoint expression $P(a,b)$ made with $a$ and $b$, finding $E(a|P(a,b))$ is equivalent to finding the distribution of $P(a,b)$ in a certain two-state probability space $(\mathcal{A},\varphi,\chi)$, where $a,b$ are c-free with respect to $(\varphi,\chi)$ in the sense of Bo\.zejko-Leinert-Speicher. We discuss how free denoising (which is set in the framework of an abstract $W^{*}$-probability space) relates to the notion of ''matrix denoising'' previously discussed in the random matrix literature.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of $\lambda \phi_2^4$- theory in 2-d Moyal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the conjecture that the $\lambda \phi^4$ QFT- model on 4-dimensional non-commutative Moyal space can be non-perturbatively constructed. As preparation, in this paper we construct the 2-dimensional case with the method of stochastic quantization. We show the local well-posedness and global well-posedness of the stochastic quantization equation, leading to a construction of the Moyal $\lambda \phi^4_2$ measure for any non-negative coupling constant $\lambda$.</description>
