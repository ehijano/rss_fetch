      <title>On the full automorphism groups of $2$-designs constructed from finite fields ${\mathbb F}_{2^n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, for $q:=2^n$ with $n\geq2$, we study two primitive maximal subgroups of the alternating group ${\sf A}_{q-1}$. These subgroups are the full automorphism groups of $2$-designs which are constructed from algebraic curves over the finite field ${\mathbb F}_q$.</description>

      <title>On the Odd Unitary Analogue of Gram-Schmidt Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1976, L.N. Vaserstein used a construction analogous to the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation, for obtaining a set of symplectic matrices from a set of elementary matrices. We have a similar construction for Petrov's odd unitary group. Here, we prove that the elementary matrices in the odd unitary analogue of the Gram-Schmidt process form a set of generators for the elementary linear group.</description>

      <title>Realizability of fusion systems by discrete groups: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare four different types of realizability for saturated fusion systems over discrete $p$-toral groups. For example, when $G$ is a locally finite group all of whose $p$-subgroups are artinian (hence discrete $p$-toral), we show that it has ``weakly Sylow'' $p$-subgroups and give explicit constructions of saturated fusion systems and associated linking systems associated to $G$. We also show that a fusion system over a discrete $p$-toral group $S$ is saturated if its set of morphisms is closed under a certain topology and the finite subgroups of $S$ satisfy the saturation axioms, and prove a version of the Cartan-Eilenberg stable elements theorem for locally finite groups.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff spectra of free pro-$p$ groups and certain $p$-adic analytic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that finitely generated non-abelian direct products $G$ of free pro-$p$ groups have full Hausdorff spectrum with respect to the lower $p$-series $\mathcal{L}$. This complements similar results with respect to other standard filtration series and a recent theorem showing that the Hausdorff spectrum $\text{hspec}^\mathcal{L}(G)$ of a $p$-adic analytic pro-$p$ group $G$ is discrete and consists of at most $2^{\dim(G)}$ rational numbers.
  The latter also left some room for improvement regarding the upper bound. Indeed, for finitely generated nilpotent pro-$p$ groups $G$ we obtain the stronger assertion that the cardinality of the Hausdorff spectrum is at most the analytic dimension of $G$. Moreover, we produce a corresponding result when the $p$-adic analytic pro-$p$ group $G$ is just infinite, which holds not just for the lower $p$-series but for arbitrary filtration series.
  Finally, we show that, if $G$ is a countably based pro-$p$ group with an open subgroup mapping onto the free abelian pro-$p$ group $\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p$, then for every prescribed finite set $\{0,1\} \subseteq X \subseteq [0,1]$ there is a filtration series $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\text{hspec}^\mathcal{S}(G) = X$; in particular, $|\text{hspec}^{\mathcal{S}}(G)|$ is unbounded, as $\mathcal{S}$ runs through all filtration series of $G$ with $|\text{hspec}^{\mathcal{S}}(G)| &lt; \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a profinite group $G$ and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of finite groups closed under taking subgroups, direct products and quotients, denote by $\mathcal{F}(G)$ the set of elements $g \in G$ such that $\{x \in G\ |\ \langle g,x \rangle \ \mbox{is a pro-}\mathcal{F} \mbox{ group}\}$ has positive Haar measure. We investigate the properties of $\mathcal{F}(G)$ for various choices of $\mathcal{F}$ and its influence on the structure of $G$.</description>

      <title>The strong hull property for affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjecture proposed by Gaetz and Gao asserts that the Cayley graph of any Coxeter group possesses the strong hull property. This conjecture has been proved for symmetric groups, hyperoctahedral groups, all right-angled Coxeter groups, and computationally verified for finite Coxeter groups of types $D_4$, $F_4$, $G_2$, and $H_3$. This paper investigates all affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3, specifically those of affine types $\widetilde{A}_2$, $\widetilde{C}_2$, and $\widetilde{G}_2$. By employing key concepts from building theory, we develop novel techniques: first reducing and classifying the convex hull in their Cayley graphs into finitely many cases, then proving the strong hull conjecture for these cases through combinatorial computations. Notably, for the case of affine type $\widetilde{G}_2$, we streamline the proof strategy by reducing it to a corollary of results established for affine type $\widetilde{A}_2$. The reduction techniques developed in this study demonstrate potential for generalization. Their possible algebraic reformulation may not only provide new perspectives for further investigation of this conjecture but also offer methodological insights for algebraic combinatorics and geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>Maps between circle bundles: Fiber-preserving, Finiteness and Realization of mapping degree sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E_i$ be an oriented circle bundle over a closed oriented aspherical $n$-manifold $M_i$ with Euler class $e_i\in H^2(M_i;\mathbb{Z})$, $i=1,2$. We prove the following:
  (i) If every finite-index subgroup of $\pi_1(M_2)$ has trivial center, then any non-zero degree map from $E_1$ to $E_2$ is homotopic to a fiber-preserving map.
  (ii) The mapping degree set of fiber-preserving maps from $E_1$ to $E_2$ is given by $$\{0\} \cup\{k\cdot \mathrm{deg}(f) \ | \, k\ne 0, \ f\colon M_1\to M_2 \, \text{with} \, \mathrm{deg}(f)\ne 0 \ \text{such that}\, f^\#(e_2)=ke_1\},$$ where $f^\# \colon H^2(M_2;\mathbb{Z})\to H^2(M_1;\mathbb{Z})$ is the induced homomorphism.
  As applications of (i) and (ii), we obtain the following results with respect to the finiteness and the realization problems for mapping degree sets:
  ($\mathcal F$) The mapping degree set $D(E_1, E_2)$ is finite if $M_2$ is hyperbolic and $e_2$ is not torsion.
  ($\mathcal R$) For any finite set $A$ of integers containing $0$ and each $n&gt;2$, $A$ is the mapping degree set $D(M,N)$ for some closed oriented $n$-manifolds $M$ and $N$.
  Items (i) and ($\mathcal F$) extend in all dimensions $\geq 3$ the previously known $3$-dimensional case (i.e., for maps between circle bundles over hyperbolic surfaces). Item ($\mathcal R$) gives a complete answer to the realization problem for finite sets (containing $0$) in any dimension, establishing in particular the previously unknown cases in dimensions $n= 4, 5$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for Patterson--Sullivan systems with applications to random walks and entropy rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Patterson--Sullivan systems, which consist of a group action on a compact metrizable space and a quasi-invariant measure which behaves like a classical Patterson--Sullivan measure. For such systems we prove a generalization of Tukia's measurable boundary rigidity theorem. We then apply this generalization to (1) study the singularity conjecture for Patterson--Sullivan measures (or, conformal densities) and stationary measures of random walks on isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, mapping class groups, and discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups; (2) prove versions of Tukia's theorem for word hyperbolic groups, Teichm\"uller spaces, and higher rank symmetric spaces; and (3) prove an entropy rigidity result for pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conjecture of Boone and Higman from the 1970's asserts that a finitely generated group $G$ has solvable word problem if and only if $G$ can be embedded into a finitely presented simple group. We comment on the history of this conjecture and survey recent results that establish the conjecture for many large classes of interesting groups.</description>

      <title>Some notes on topological rings and their groups of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02634v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $R$ is a topological ring then $R^{\ast}$, the group of units of $R$, with the subspace topology is not necessarily a topological group. This leads us to the following natural definition: By an \emph{absolute topological ring} we mean a topological ring such that its group of units with the subspace topology is a topological group. We prove that every commutative ring with the $I$-adic topology is an absolute topological ring. Next, we prove that if $I$ is an ideal of a ring $R$ then for the $I$-adic topology over $R$ we have $\pi_{0}(R)=R/(\bigcap\limits_{n\geqslant1}I^{n})=t(R)$ where $\pi_{0}(R)$ is the space of connected components of $R$ and $t(R)$ is the space of irreducible closed subsets of $R$. We observed that the main result of Koh \cite{kwangil} as well as its corrected form \cite[Chap II, \S12, Theorem 12.1]{Ursul} are not true, and then we corrected this result in the right way. In the Wikipedia pages, it is claimed that ``the identity component of a topological group is always a characteristic subgroup'', we also provide a counterexample to this claim. Finally, we fix a gap in the proof of the fact that every epimorphism of the category of Hausdorff topological spaces has a dense image.</description>
