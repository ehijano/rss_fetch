      <title>Survey-Wide Asteroid Discovery with a High-Performance Computing Enabled Non-Linear Digital Tracking Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys detect asteroids by linking together their appearances across multiple images taken over time. This approach faces limitations in detecting faint asteroids and handling the computational complexity of trajectory linking. We present a novel method that adapts ``digital tracking" - traditionally used for short-term linear asteroid motion across images - to work with large-scale synoptic surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin/LSST). Our approach combines hundreds of sparse observations of individual asteroids across their non-linear orbital paths to enhance detection sensitivity by several magnitudes. To address the computational challenges of processing massive data sets and dense orbital phase spaces, we developed a specialized high-performance computing architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments that take advantage of the extensive computational resources at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This work enables the detection of significantly fainter asteroids in existing and future survey data, potentially increasing the observable asteroid population by orders of magnitude across different orbital families, from near-Earth objects (NEOs) to Kuiper belt objects (KBOs).</description>

      <title>Towards High Precision Mass Measurements of Two Sub-Neptunes in the K2-266 Planetary System Through Transit Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes have been found to be one of the most common types of exoplanets, yet their physical parameters and properties are poorly determined and in need of further investigation. In order to improve the mass measurement and parameter determination of two sub-Neptunes, K2-266 d and K2-266 e, we present new transit observations obtained with CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), increasing the baseline of transit data from a few epochs to 165 epochs for K2-266 d, and to 121 epochs for K2-266 e. Through a two-stage fitting process, it is found that the masses of K2-266 d and K2-266 e are 6.01$\pm$0.43 $M_\oplus$ and 7.70$\pm$0.58 $M_\oplus$, respectively. With these updated values and one order of magnitude better precision, we confirm the planets to belong to the population of planets that has been determined to be volatile-rich. Finally, we present the results of dynamical simulations, showing that the system is stable, the orbits are not chaotic, and that these two planets are close to but not in 4:3 mean motion resonance.</description>

      <title>Probing 2D Asymmetries of an Exoplanet Atmosphere from Chromatic Transit Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for investigating atmospheric inhomogeneities in exoplanets through transmission spectroscopy. Our approach links chromatic variations in conventional transit model parameters (central transit time, total and full durations, and transit depth) to atmospheric asymmetries. By separately analyzing atmospheric asymmetries during ingress and egress, we can derive clear connections between these variations and the underlying asymmetries of the planetary limbs. Additionally, this approach enables us to investigate differences between the limbs slightly offset from the terminator on the dayside and the nightside. We applied this method to JWST's NIRSpec/G395H observations of the hot Saturn exoplanet WASP-39 b. Our analysis suggests a higher abundance of CO2 on the evening limb compared to the morning limb and indicates a greater probability of SO2 on the limb slightly offset from the terminator on the dayside relative to the nightside. These findings highlight the potential of our method to enhance the understanding of photochemical processes in exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Earth as an Exoplanet: Investigating the effects of cloud variability on the direct-imaging of atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planet's spectrum is dynamic and only represents a time-dependent snapshot of its properties. Changing atmospheric conditions due to climate and weather patterns, particularly variation in cloud cover, can significantly affect the spectrum in ways that complicate the understanding of a planet's baseline atmospheric properties. Variable cloud cover and cloud properties affect the detectability of atmospheric constituents, and also greatly influence the radiative transfer that determines a planet's spectrum. This has considerable implications for direct imaging observations of potentially habitable exoplanets and thus it is critical to study and characterize the effects of clouds on their spectra. Clouds have been extensively modeled before and their effects have been incorporated across climate frameworks spanning a spectrum of complexity. Given the challenges associated with modeling clouds, we adopt a novel approach in this work to study the effects of clouds by using real-time cloud data from Earth observations. Treating Earth as an exoplanet and using detailed observations from the MERRA 2 data collection, we quantify the effects of cloud variability on the spectrum as well as on the detectability of atmospheric constituents, specifically biomarkers like O2, O3 and H2O. The coverage and vertical position of clouds significantly affects the SNRs of these gases and subsequently their detectability in exo-Earth atmospheres. Moreover, we show that variations in the amount of cloud cover will potentially confound efforts to retrieve a stable baseline atmosphere for a planet. This work has important applications to future direct-imaging missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO).</description>

      <title>"Dark comet" 2005 VL$_1$ is unlikely to be the lost Soviet-era probe Venera 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loeb &amp; Cloete (2025) intriguingly suggest that the near-Earth object 2005 VL$_1$ could be the lost Soviet probe Venera 2. Here I evaluate the plausibility of such a claim against the available data. I have re-determined the orbit of 2005 VL$_1$ (including a non-gravitational acceleration component) using the astrometric observations retrieved from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database. By propagating the orbit of 2005 VL$_1$ over the period of the Venera 2 mission, I compare this object's distance from the Earth and from Venus at the times of the probe's launch and flyby with Venus, respectively. My analysis, which takes into account realistic uncertainties on both the orbit of 2005 VL1 and the position of Venera 2, decisively rules out the proposed identification. My approach relies entirely on open-source software and publicly available data, and could represent a viable method to assess similar claims in the future.</description>

      <title>Resonant drag instabilities for polydisperse dust. II. The streaming and settling instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic instabilities, called resonant drag instabilities. These instabilities have predominantly been studied for single grain sizes, in which case they are found to grow fast. Nonlinear simulations indicate that strong dust overdensities can form, aiding the formation of planetesimals. In reality, however, there is going to be a distribution of dust sizes, which potentially has important consequences. We study two different resonant drag instabilities, the streaming instability and the settling instability, taking into account a continuous spectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether these instabilities survive in the polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the monodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid in an unstratified shearing box to recover the streaming instability and, for approximate stratification, the settling instability, in all cases focusing on small dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the singular perturbation of the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation due to the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the resonance. The contribution of the resonance to the integral can be negative, as in the case of the streaming instability, which as a result does not survive in the polydisperse regime, or positive, which is the case in the settling instability. The latter therefore has a polydisperse counterpart, with growth rates that can be comparable to the monodisperse case. Wide size distributions in almost all cases remove the resonant nature of drag instabilities. This can lead to reduced growth, as is the case in large parts of parameter space for the settling instability, or complete stabilisation, as is the case for the streaming instability.</description>

      <title>Ephemeris Reconstruction for Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko During Rosetta Proximity Phase from Radiometric Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides a continuous ephemeris reconstruction for comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by reanalyzing Rosetta radiometric measurements and Earth-based astrometry. Given the comet-to-spacecraft relative trajectory provided by the navigation team, these measurements were used to estimate the comet state and some critical physical parameters, most notably the non-gravitational accelerations induced by the outgassing of surface volatiles, for which different models were tested and compared. The reference reconstructed ephemeris, which uses a stochastic acceleration model, has position uncertainties below 10 km, 30 km, and 80 km in the orbital radial, tangential, and normal directions for the whole duration of the Rosetta proximity phase (from July 2014 to October 2016). Furthermore, the solution can fit ground-based astrometry between March 2010 and July 2018, covering a complete heliocentric orbit of 67P. The estimated comet non-gravitational accelerations are dominated by the orbital radial and normal components, reaching peak values of $(1.28 \pm 0.17) \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m/s}^2$ and $(0.52 \pm 0.20) \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m/s}^2$, respectively 15 days and 24 days after perihelion. Furthermore, the acceleration magnitude is shown to have a steep dependence on the comet heliocentric distance $\text{NGA} \sim r_\odot^{-6}$ and shows asymmetries in the pre- and post-perihelion activities. The estimated acceleration components, agnostic due to the limited physical assumptions, could be used as a constraint for future investigations involving high-fidelity thermophysical models of the comet surface.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared evidence for iron-rich dust in the multi-ringed inner disk of HD 144432</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Rocky planets form by the concentration of solid particles in the inner few au regions of planet-forming disks. Their chemical composition reflects the materials in the disk available in the solid phase at the time the planets were forming. Aims. We aim to constrain the structure and dust composition of the inner disk of the young star HD 144432, using an extensive set of infrared interferometric data taken by the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), combining PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE observations. Methods. We introduced a new physical disk model, TGMdust, to image the interferometric data, and to fit the disk structure and dust composition. We also performed equilibrium condensation calculations with GGchem. Results. Our best-fit model has three disk zones with ring-like structures at 0.15, 1.3, and 4.1 au. Assuming that the dark regions in the disk at ~0.9 au and at ~3 au are gaps opened by planets, we estimate the masses of the putative gap-opening planets to be around a Jupiter mass. We find evidence for an optically thin emission ($\tau&lt;0.4$) from the inner two disk zones ($r&lt;4$ au) at $\lambda&gt;3\ \mu$m. Our silicate compositional fits confirm radial mineralogy gradients. To identify the dust component responsible for the infrared continuum emission, we explore two cases for the dust composition, one with a silicate+iron mixture and the other with a silicate+carbon one. We find that the iron-rich model provides a better fit to the spectral energy distribution. Conclusions. We propose that in the warm inner regions ($r&lt;5$ au) of typical planet-forming disks, most if not all carbon is in the gas phase, while iron and iron sulfide grains are major constituents of the solid mixture along with forsterite and enstatite. Our analysis demonstrates the need for detailed studies of the dust in inner disks with new mid-infrared instruments such as MATISSE and JWST/MIRI.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Data Calibration with Transformer Model Using Physical Constraints: A Scalable Method for Satellite Missions, Illustrated by Tianwen-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.</description>
