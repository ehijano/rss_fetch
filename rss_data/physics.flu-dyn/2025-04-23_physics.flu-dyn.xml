      <title>About the Upstream Contamination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the upward transport of waterborne pollutants from a lower container to an upper container through vertically falling water streams. While previous analyses have primarily focused on inclined channels, we extend the theoretical framework to consider vertical configurations. Two distinct cases are examined: (i) a vertical flow within a cylindrical tube, and (ii) a free-falling water jet. For the first case, we derive an analytical expression for the critical water flux required to prevent the upward migration of particles. In the second case, we establish a relationship among water flux, particle size, and vertical position along the stream, which determines the feasibility of upward particle transport. Our findings reveal a fundamental difference between the two configurations. In the tubular flow case, surface tension has negligible influence on particle motion. In contrast, in the free-fall scenario, upward particle transport is only possible in the presence of surface tension. Moreover, we demonstrate that for any given water flux, there exists a threshold height difference beyond which contamination of the upper container is not possible. Increasing the water flux further inhibits any upward transport of pollutants</description>

      <title>A Scalable Methodology for Reinstating the Superhydrophilicity of Ambient-Contaminant Compromised Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degradation of the hemi-wicking property of superhydrophilic high-energy surfaces due to contaminant adsorption from the ambient atmosphere is well documented. This degradation compromises the performance of such surfaces, thus affecting their efficacy in real-world applications where hemi-wicking is critical. In this work, the role of surface micro/nanostructure morphology of laser-textured metallic surfaces on superhydrophilicity degradation is studied. We explore intrinsic contact angle variations of superhydrophilic surfaces via adsorption of organics from the surroundings, which brings about the associated changes in surface chemistry. Furthermore, we explore condensation from humid air as a scalable and environment friendly methodology that can reinstate surface superhydrophilicity to a considerable extent (64% recovery of intrinsic wettability after three hours of condensation) due to the efficient removal of physisorbed contaminants from the surface texture features. The present results strengthen the argument that contact-line movement at fine scales can be used for de-pinning and removal of adsorbed organic molecules from contaminated surfaces.</description>

      <title>Impact of Particle Injection Velocity on the Stability of the Particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of a thermally stratified fluid layer between horizontal walls, where thermal particles are continuously injected at one boundary and extracted at the other - a system known as particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard (pRB) - is studied. For a fixed volumetric particle flux, reducing the injection velocity stabilizes the system when heavy particles are introduced from above, but destabilizes it when light particles are injected from below. For very light particles (bubbles), low injection velocities can shift the onset of convection to negative Rayleigh numbers, i.e. heating from above. Particles accumulate non-uniformly near the extraction wall and in regions of strong vertical flow, aligning with either wall-impinging or wall-detaching zones depending on whether injection is at sub- or super-terminal velocity.</description>

      <title>An efficient offline sensor placement method for flow estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient method to optimize sensor placement for flow estimation using sensors with time-delay embedding in advection-dominated flows. Our solution allows identifying promising candidates for sensor positions using solely preliminary flow field measurements with non-time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), without introducing physical probes in the flow. Data-driven estimation in advection-dominated flows often exploits time-delay embedding to enrich the sensor information for the reconstruction, i.e. it uses the information embedded in probe time series to provide a more accurate estimation. Optimizing the probe position is the key to improving the accuracy of such estimation. Unfortunately, the cost of performing an online combinatorial search to identify the optimal sensor placement in experiments is often prohibitive. We leverage the principle that, in advection-dominated flows, rows of vectors from PIV fields embed similar information to that of probe time series located at the downstream end of the domain. We propose thus to optimize the sensor placement using the row data from non-time-resolved PIV measurements as a surrogate of the data a real probe would actually capture in time. This optimization is run offline and requires only one preliminary experiment with standard PIV. Once the optimal positions are identified, the probes can be installed and operated simultaneously with the PIV to perform the time-resolved field estimation. We show that the proposed method outperforms equidistant positioning or greedy optimization techniques available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Study of Auto-igniting Spray Flame in Vitiated Swirling Hot Coflow using flamelet generated model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swirl-stabilized auto-igniting spray flames are essential for designing efficient and clean combustion systems. The present study performs large eddy simulations (LES) of the dilute auto-igniting methanol flame in a vitiated, hot coflow of varying swirl intensities. The six-dimensional Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) technique is used to solve the reactive flow accurately and economically. The swirl numbers (SN), i.e. 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, and 1.4, are used to assess their effect on auto-ignition and flame stability. At lower to moderate swirl numbers (SN =0.2, 0.6), the increase in swirl is found to increase the lift-off height. Beyond the critical swirl number (SN=0.6), the lift-off height drops. Also, the time-averaged flame structure transitions from a tubular-like flame into a uniformly distributed combustion region at these high swirl numbers. It also results in a more compact flame for the higher swirl numbers. These effects on flame dynamics are analyzed in detail using the mean gas-phase flow field distribution, particle statistics, and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD).</description>

      <title>Impact of Fuel Injection Temperature Dynamics on the Stability of Liquid Oxygen-Methane Supercritical Combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial factor in the stability of high-pressure rocket-scale combustors is the temperature at which fuel is injected. This study investigates its effect on the stability of supercritical liquid oxygen (LOx)-methane combustion and highlights the impact of shear layer dynamics in cases with lower injection temperatures. The stability features of a rocket-scale combustor operating with multiple injector elements are investigated using a high-fidelity large eddy simulation (LES) framework. The numerical framework combines a flamelet-generated manifold (FGM) combustion model with complex real gas thermodynamics in a scale-resolving simulation setup. It reproduces the non-equilibrium transcritical injection and supercritical combustion characteristics of supercritical methane-oxygen flames. To ascertain the effect of injection temperature on flame and combustor stability, we perform several LES simulations at various methane injection temperatures and produce a stability map. Our analysis shows extremely unstable flame characteristics at lower fuel injection temperatures that are not seen under typical fuel injection circumstances. Below a specific methane injection temperature, LES captures a high-amplitude, self-sustaining instability. It is determined that the combustor becomes unstable below a specific stability boundary temperature. Detailed spectral and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of the stable and unstable cases reveals the onset of longitudinal acoustic waves in the combustor. Our thorough investigation pinpoints the instability mechanism, emphasizing that the leading causes of this self-sustaining instability in the combustor are a reduced velocity ratio, fuel buildup, and fuel cut-off occurrences.</description>

      <title>Analysis of surface tension in terms of force gradient per unit area. Part II : Theoretical model of a statistical molecular reorganization gradient at interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically, surface tension is seen as a force per unit length or as energy per unit area. The surface energy is calculated thermodynamically on the surface of a mathematical layer with no thickness. The surface energy concept is certainly practical and elegant, but it doesn't seem entirely satisfactory to us. In an earlier article 1 , we proposed a thought experiment in which surface tension is replaced with an equivalent force per unit area according to the principles of fluid mechanics. This theoretical tool can be used to rewrite the classical static equations in terms of surface stress gradient and propose a new way of calculating known phenomena such as meniscus, capillary tube, water drops, etc. In this article, we propose a new thought experiment assuming that beyond the classical interaction forces acting at short distance, molecules at liquid interfaces statistically reorganize according to a stationary process of creation/destruction at long distance. The process is such that the degree of statistical molecular organization decreases with a gradient from the surface to the bulk, where the molecules recover the natural disorder of Brownian motion. Assuming that this reorganization process follows an Avrami-type law, we will reinterpret the effects of surface tension in terms of energy per unit volume, which will allow us to retrieve the previous equations of force gradient per unit area.</description>

      <title>Self-sorting of bidisperse particles in evaporating sessile droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dispersion and self-sorting dynamics of bidisperse particles, i.e., a mixture of two distinct particle sizes, during the evaporation of ethanol droplets on a heated substrate, focusing on the influence of surface wettability, Marangoni stresses, and relative particle density. To this end, numerical simulations are carried out using a two-stage numerical approach: the first stage simulates the gas-liquid flow along with the heat and vapor distribution, while the second stage models the particle behavior using Lagrangian particle tracking. The results reveal that for an ethanol droplet evaporating with a constant contact angle in the absence of thermocapillary Marangoni stresses, the flow induced by the receding motion of the contact line supersedes the capillary flow, moving the fluid from the contact line to the apex of the droplet. This flow moves the particles from the bulk of the droplet to the apex of the droplet and suppresses size-based self-sorting of the particles. However, in the presence of Marangoni stresses, a flow along the interface near the apex of the droplet promotes the self-sorting of particles based on their size, whereby smaller particles concentrate near the droplet apex and larger particles form an outer shell around them.</description>

      <title>Transition mechanisms in hypersonic wind-tunnel nozzles: a methodological approach using global linear stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Base-flow computations and stability analyses are performed for a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle at a Mach number of 6. Isothermal and adiabatic wall boundary conditions are investigated, and moderate stagnation conditions are used to provide representative scenarios to study the transition in quiet hypersonic wind tunnel facilities. Under these conditions, the studied nozzle shows a small flow separation at the convergent inlet. Global stability analysis reveals that this recirculation bubble may trigger a classical three-dimensional stationary unstable global mode. Resolvent analysis reveals G\"ortler, first and second Mack modes affecting the divergent part of the nozzle, along with a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability induced by the bubble. The present study also highlights the key impact of perturbations located in the convergent inlet on the development of instabilities further downstream in the divergent outlet, helping understand the need and efficacy of a suction lip upstream of the nozzle throat to mitigate instabilities in the divergent nozzle. Detailed knowledge of all these mechanisms is essential for understanding flows in quiet hypersonic wind tunnel nozzles and, consequently, represents a key step toward the optimisation of such nozzles.</description>

      <title>Coalescence delay mediated by the gas layer during the impact of hot droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coalescence may not occur immediately when droplets impact a liquid film. Despite the prevalence of the high-temperature condition during the impact process in many applications, the effect of droplet temperature on droplet coalescence is rarely considered. In this study, we experimentally investigate the droplet coalescence during the impact of hot droplets on a liquid film by using color interferometry, high-speed imaging, and infrared imaging. We find that the coalescence of the hot droplet with the liquid film can be delayed which is mediated by the intervening gas layer between the droplet and the film. Compared with droplets at room temperature, the residence time of hot droplets can increase by more than two orders of magnitude. We find that the thickness of the gas layer increases with the droplet temperature, explaining that the thermal delay of coalescence is due to the thicker gas layer. During the hot droplet impact, the temperature gradient at the bottom of the droplet induces Maranogni flow, which can delay the drainage of the intervening gas layer. The results also show that as the Weber number increases, the residence time of the droplet decreases because of the thinner thickness of the gas layer.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of finite-size ammonia and n-heptane droplets evaporation rates in weakly compressible homogeneous turbulence: an interface-resolved Direct Numerical Simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents direct numerical simulation (DNS) of finite-size, interface-resolved ammonia and n-heptane droplets evaporating in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Simulations are conducted for each fuel in a dense spray region, where the liquid volume fraction exceeds $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. The focus is on investigating the complex interactions between droplets, turbulence, and phase change, with emphasis on droplet-droplet interactions and their influence on the evaporation process. We provide state-of-the-art insights into the evaporation characteristics of two different fuels under turbulent conditions, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of their different evaporation rates in spray-combustion applications. To this end, the present study also explores how varying turbulence intensities affect the evaporation rates of each fuel, revealing differences in coalescence behavior and energy transfer from the liquid to the gaseous phase. These findings are crucial to the improvement of predictive CFD models and to the optimization of fuel injection in spray-combustion applications, especially under high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Data-Assimilated Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observed Chaotic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of many applications in energy and transport sectors is to control turbulent flows. However, because of chaotic dynamics and high dimensionality, the control of turbulent flows is exceedingly difficult. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods can discover optimal control policies by interacting with the environment, but they require full state information, which is often unavailable in experimental settings. We propose a data-assimilated model-based RL (DA-MBRL) framework for systems with partial observability and noisy measurements. Our framework employs a control-aware Echo State Network for data-driven prediction of the dynamics, and integrates data assimilation with an Ensemble Kalman Filter for real-time state estimation. An off-policy actor-critic algorithm is employed to learn optimal control strategies from state estimates. The framework is tested on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing a spatiotemporally chaotic flow from noisy and partial measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals (fields). The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation.We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>

      <title>Velocity modulations in view of the elliptical approach at Wendelstein 7-X</title>

Abstract: The estimation of the poloidal velocity of the turbulence and the poloidal mean flow velocity are important quantities for the study of sheared flows on turbulence and transport. The estimation depends on the underlying model of the turbulence. Beside the propagation time of the turbulence, its decay with the fading time must be considered. For the description of the propagation, the elliptical approach is applied, which takes into account the propagation and fading time of the turbulence. The model has been applied successfully in experimental fluid dynamics and is confirmed by direct numerical simulations, also.
  In this paper, the elliptical approach is applied in the analysis of density fluctuations, measured by poloidal correlation reflectometry at two different fusion devices, TEXTOR and W7-X. For the latter, it is demonstrated that the elliptical approach is necessary for a correct description of the turbulence propagation. In addition, the velocity modulations are investigated, which in principle can be either generated by an oscillation of the propagation time of density fluctuations and/or an oscillation of the fading of the turbulence. An example for low frequency velocity oscillations in W7-X will be given in the paper, showing a relation between turbulence properties and small oscillations on the measured diamagnetic plasma energy.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the idea of quantum turbulence was first proposed by Feynman, and later realized in experiments of superfluid helium and Bose-Einstein condensates, much emphasis has been put in finding signatures that distinguish quantum turbulence from its classical counterpart. Here we show that quantum turbulence in rotating condensates is fundamentally different from the classical case. While rotating quantum turbulence develops a negative temperature state with self-organization of the kinetic energy in quantized vortices, it also displays an anisotropic dissipation mechanism and a different, non-Kolmogorovian, scaling of the energy at small scales. This scaling is compatible with Vinen turbulence and is also found in recent simulations of condensates with multicharged vortices. An elementary explanation for the scaling is presented in terms of disorder in the vortices positions.</description>
