      <title>The SChISM study: Cell-free DNA size profiles as predictors of progression in advanced carcinoma treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Many advanced cancer patients experience progression under immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) size profiles offer a promising noninvasive multi-cancer approach to monitor and predict immunotherapy response. Methods: In the SChISM (Size CfDNA Immunotherapy Signature Monitoring) study (NCT05083494), pre-treatment plasmatic cfDNA size profiles from 126 ICI-treated advanced carcinomas were quantified using the BIABooster device. Fragmentomederived variables (concentration, peaks' position, and fragment size ranges) at baseline were analyzed for associations with early progression (EP, progression at first imaging) and progression-free survival (PFS), using logistic and Cox regression models. Bootstrap analysis validated robustness. Additional analyses were performed in homogeneous subpopulations: first-line lung cancer patients (n = 60) and head-andneck patients treated with Nivolumab (n = 25). Results: Higher cfDNA concentration and high quantities of short fragments (111-240 base pairs (bp)) were associated with poor response, unlike long fragments (&gt; 300 bp). The proportion of fragments longer than 1650 bp demonstrated highest discriminatory power (AUC = 0.73, C-index = 0.69). It was significantly associated with non-EP (odds ratio = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.25-0.62]) and longer PFS (hazard ratio: 0.54 [95% CI: 0.42-0.68]). These associations remained significant when adjusted for confounders (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor type, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and across both subpopulations. Bootstrap analysis confirmed robustness with mean accuracy of 70.1 $\pm$ 4.17% and positive predictive value of 55.6 $\pm$ 7.37%, in test sets. Conclusion: cfDNA size profiles significantly predicted ICI response and anticipate relapse, outperforming the routinely used marker programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry and reflecting enhanced immune system activation.  Trial registration: (NCT05083494), date of registration: 2021-10-19.</description>

      <title>Resolving Tangling in Multi-Conformer Refinement via Iterative Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of advanced crystallographic techniques has shifted structural biology from static, single-conformer models toward probing protein dynamics. Extracting cooperative motions from temporally and spatially averaged electron density maps requires both high-resolution data and refinement algorithms capable of handling conformational heterogeneity. However, current refinement protocols often fail due to the tangling phenomenon, in which conformational states become improperly intertwined during optimization. Here, we present an automated refinement methodology based on iterative projections within the divide-and-concur framework. This approach enables seamless integration of geometric constraints with experimental density constraints derived from observed scattering amplitudes. By allowing each atom to satisfy density constraints independently, we show that this framework effectively circumvents tangling artifacts and achieves robust refinement performance, even for models initialized with R-factors as high as 12%. Just as iterative projections revolutionized phase retrieval in crystallography, we demonstrate that they can also address the optimization challenges in multi-conformational refinement. This work establishes a computational foundation for advancing crystallographic methodologies to resolve conformational heterogeneity and ultimately capture protein dynamics at atomic resolution.</description>

      <title>When correcting for regression to the mean is worse than no correction at all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous regression to the mean (RTM) effect complicates statistical inference in biological studies of change. We demonstrate that common RTM correction methods are flawed: the Berry et al. method popularized by Kelly &amp; Price in The American Naturalist is unreliable for hypothesis testing, leading to both false positives and negatives, while the theoretically unbiased Blomqvist method has poor efficiency in limited sample sizes. Our findings show that the most robust approach to handling RTM is not to correct the data but to use the crude slope in conjunction with an assessment of the experiment's repeatability. Ultimately, we argue that any conclusion about a differential treatment effect is statistically unfounded without a clear understanding of the experiment's repeatability.</description>

      <title>TumorPred: A Computational Framework Implemented via an R/Shiny Web Application for Parameter Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis in Compartmental Brain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is difficult or infeasible to directly measure how much of a drug actually enters the human brain and a brain tumor, how long it remains there, and to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters, as well as how changes in these parameters influence model outputs and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Compartmental modeling offers a powerful mathematical approach to describe drug distribution and elimination in the body using systems of differential equations. This study introduces TumorPred, an R/Shiny-based web application designed for model simulation, sensitivity analysis, and pharmacokinetic parameter calculation in a permeability-limited four-compartment brain model. The model closely mimics human brain functionality for drug delivery and aims to predict the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the brain blood, brain mass, and cranial and spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the human brain. The app provides real-time output updates in response to input modifications and allows users to visualize and download simulated plots and data tables. The computational accuracy of TumorPred is validated against results from the Simcyp Simulator (Certara Inc.). TumorPred is freely accessible and serves as an invaluable computational tool and data-driven resource for advancing drug development and optimizing treatment strategies for more effective brain cancer therapy.</description>

      <title>Pose-Free 3D Quantitative Phase Imaging of Flowing Cellular Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging. By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations, providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms.</description>

      <title>Histo-Miner: Deep Learning based Tissue Features Extraction Pipeline from H&amp;E Whole Slide Images of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analysis of Whole-Slide Images (WSI) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</description>
