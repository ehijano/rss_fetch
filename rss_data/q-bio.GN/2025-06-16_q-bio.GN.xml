      <title>HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings, enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and GRN-based representations.</description>

      <title>Brain-wide interpolation and conditioning of gene expression in the human brain using Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the efficacy and utility of recent advances in non-local, non-linear image interpolation and extrapolation algorithms, specifically, ideas based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), as a tool for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. We seek to utilize the microarray gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a voxel-level resolution. To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes, whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from Abagen as a baseline/reference.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Modeling of CRISPR-Cas12 Activity Using Foundation Models and Chromatin Accessibility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12 genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding), and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training. Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity prediction.</description>

      <title>SemanticST: Spatially Informed Semantic Graph Learning for1 Clustering, Integration, and Scalable Analysis of Spatial2 Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed, graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified, biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data. SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells). Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI, NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells, suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and next-generation precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Viral Dark Matter: Illuminating Protein Function, Ecology, and Biotechnological Promises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and play central roles in shaping microbiomes and influencing ecosystem functions. Yet, most viral genes remain uncharacterized, comprising what is commonly referred to as "viral dark matter." Metagenomic studies across diverse environments consistently show that 40-90% of viral genes lack known homologs or annotated functions. This persistent knowledge gap limits our ability to interpret viral sequence data, understand virus-host interactions, and assess the ecological or applied significance of viral genes. Among the most intriguing components of viral dark matter are auxiliary viral genes (AVGs), including auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), regulatory genes (AReGs), and host physiology-modifying genes (APGs), which may alter host function during infection and contribute to microbial metabolism, stress tolerance, or resistance. In this review, we explore recent advances in the discovery and functional characterization of viral dark matter. We highlight representative examples of novel viral proteins across diverse ecosystems including human microbiomes, soil, oceans, and extreme environments, and discuss what is known, and still unknown, about their roles. We then examine the bioinformatic and experimental challenges that hinder functional characterization, and present emerging strategies to overcome these barriers. Finally, we highlight both the fundamental and applied benefits that multidisciplinary efforts to characterize viral proteins can bring. By integrating computational predictions with experimental validation, and fostering collaboration across disciplines, we emphasize that illuminating viral dark matter is both feasible and essential for advancing microbial ecology and unlocking new tools for biotechnology.</description>

      <title>S3Mirror: Making Genomic Data Transfers Fast, Reliable, and Observable with DBOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To meet the needs of a large pharmaceutical organization, we set out to create S3Mirror - an application for transferring large genomic sequencing datasets between S3 buckets quickly, reliably, and observably. We used the DBOS Transact durable execution framework to achieve these goals and benchmarked the performance and cost of the application. S3Mirror is an open source DBOS Python application that can run in a variety of environments, including DBOS Cloud Pro, where it runs as much as 40x faster than AWS DataSync at a fraction of the cost. Moreover, S3Mirror is resilient to failures and allows for real-time filewise observability of ongoing and past transfers.</description>
