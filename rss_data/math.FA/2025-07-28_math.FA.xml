      <title>On $A$-orthogonality preservation and Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek theorem in semi-Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local preservation of $A$-orthogonality at a point by $A$-bounded operators within the semi-Hilbertian framework induced by a positive operator $A$ on a Hilbert space $\mathbb{H}.$ We provide complete characterizations of such preservation. Additionally, we explore properties of the $A$-norm attainment set of an $A$-bounded operator in light of $A$-orthogonality preservation. We also study analogous properties for the minimum $A$-norm attainment set of an $A$-bounded operator. We then characterize the $A$-isometries as the $A$-norm one operators preserving $A$-orthogonality. Finally, we characterize those subsets of Hilbert spaces for which such preservation by an $A$-norm one operator implies that the operator is an $A$-isometry.</description>

      <title>Representing Locally Hilbert Spaces and Functional Models for Locally Normal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to explore in all remaining aspects the spectral theory of locally normal operators. In a previous article we proved the spectral theorem in terms of locally spectral measures. Here we prove the spectral theorem in terms of projective limits of certain multiplication operators with functions which are locally of type $L^\infty$. In order to do this, we first investigate strictly inductive systems of measure spaces and point out the concept of representing locally Hilbert space for which we obtain a functional model as a strictly inductive limit of $L^2$ type spaces. Then, we first obtain a functional model for locally normal operators on representing locally Hilbert spaces combined with a spectral multiplicity model on a pseudo-concrete functional model for the underlying locally Hilbert space, under a certain technical condition on the directed set. Finally, under the same technical condition on the directed set, we derive the spectral theorem for locally normal operators in terms of projective limits of certain multiplication operators with functions which are locally of type $L^\infty$ in two forms. As a consequence of the main result we sketch the direct integral representation of locally normal operators under the same technical assumptions and the separability of the locally Hilbert space. Examples of strictly inductive systems of measure spaces involving the Hata tree-like selfsimilar set, which justify the technical condition on a relevant case and which may open a connection with analysis on fractal sets, are included.</description>

      <title>A Noncommutative Szeg\H{o}-Type Theorem on the Row-Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we leverage the recently developed theory of noncommutative (nc) measures to prove a free noncommutative analogue of many known equalities extending the weak Szeg\H{o} limit theorem, by applying Constantinescu's theory of Schur parameters to an appropriate kernel on the free monoid on $d$ generators, where $d \geq 1$; in particular, we show that our nc Szeg\H{o} entropy depends only upon the absolutely continuous part of the associated nc measure. We obtain a correspondence between nc measures and multi-Toeplitz kernels arising from considering the moments of the nc measure, and apply this correspondence to study orthogonal polynomials associated to an nc measure. Finally, we study the determinantal zeros of those polynomials and obtain a noncommutative row-ball analogue of the so-called Zeros Theorem for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Selections of integrable multifunctions in arbitrary Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the origin of the integration theory for multifunctions in the sixties in the pioneering works of G. Debreu and R. Aumann, Nobel prizes for the Economy in 1983 and in 2005, respectively. The Aumann integral is defined by means the integrals of measurable selections of the multifunctions. An important tool for the existence of measurable selections is the Kuratowski and Ryll-Nardzewski theorem, although this famous result needs the separability of the range space. Other definitions of multifunction integrals, that are not based on selections have been developed such as Pettis, Henstock, McShane, Birkhoff, Kurzweill-Henstock-Pettis, or variationally integrals. However to obtain good properties of such integrals for multifunctions one also needs to study "nice" properties of selections.
  This chapter is devoted to selection results in the framework of an arbitrary Banach space (non necessarily separable). In particular we address our attention to the existence of selections integrable of the same sense of the given multifunction
  and to their applications to the problem of representing a multifunction as a translation of a multifunction with better integrable properties by means of one of its integrable selections.</description>

      <title>On harmonic quasiregular mappings in Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical result of Hardy and Littlewood says that if $f=u+iv$ is analytic in the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ and $u$ is in the harmonic Bergman space $a^p$ ($0&lt;p&lt;\infty$), then $v$ is also in $a^p$. This complements a celebrated result of M. Riesz on Hardy spaces, which only holds for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. These results do not extend directly to complex-valued harmonic functions. We prove that the Hardy-Littlewood theorem holds for a harmonic function $f=u+iv$ if we place the assumption that $f$ is quasiregular in $\mathbb{D}$. This makes further progress on the recent Riesz type theorems for harmonic quasiregular mappings by several authors.
  Then we consider univalent harmonic mappings in $\mathbb{D}$ and study their membership in Bergman spaces. In particular, we produce a non-trivial range of $p&gt;0$ such that every univalent harmonic function $f$ (and the partial derivatives $f_\theta,\, rf_r$) is of class $a^p$. This result extends nicely to harmonic quasiconformal mappings in $\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>Concentration comparison for nonlinear diffusion on model manifolds and P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the mass concentration comparison for a class of nonlinear diffusion equations posed on Riemannian manifolds $ \mathbb{M}^n $ that are spherically symmetric, that is, model manifolds. The concentration comparison states that the solution of a certain diffusion equation that takes the radially decreasing (Schwarz) rearrangement $ u_0^\star $ as its initial datum is more concentrated than the original solution starting from $u_0$. This is known to hold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a consequence of the celebrated P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, which asserts that the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of a function $f$ (belonging to an appropriate Sobolev space) is always larger than the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of its radially decreasing rearrangement $f^\star$. However, if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ is a general model manifold, it is not for granted that the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality holds; in fact, we will provide a simple condition involving the scalar curvature of $\mathbb{M}^n $ under which such an inequality actually fails. The main result we prove states that, given any continuous, nondecreasing, and nontrivial function $ \phi: [0,+\infty) \to [0,+\infty) $, the filtration equation $ \partial_t u = \Delta \phi(u) $ satisfies the concentration comparison in $ \mathbb{M}^n \times (0,+\infty) $ if and only if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. In particular, the validity of such a comparison for the heat equation is sufficient to guarantee that the same holds for all filtration equations. Moreover, we prove that if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports a centered isoperimetric inequality then the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, and thus the concentration comparison, holds. This allows us to include important examples such as the hyperbolic space and the sphere.</description>

      <title>Normal operators in real and quaternionic Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.16266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new approach to normal operators in real Hilbert spaces is discussed, and a spectral representation is obtained, derived directly from the complex case. The results are then applied to quaternionic normal operators, regarded as a special class of real normal operators. This point of view allows us to consider their spectrum and associated measures to be defined on subsets of the complex plane, in a classical manner.</description>

      <title>Linear maps preserving product of involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An element of the algebra $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ of $n \times n$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is called an involution if its square equals the identity matrix. Gustafson, Halmos, and Radjavi proved that any product of involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ can be expressed as a product of at most four involutions. In this article, we investigate the bijective linear preservers of the sets of products of two, three, or four involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for a class of psi-Caputo time-fractional systems of order from one to two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for a specific class of time-fractional $\psi$-Caputo evolution systems with a derivative order ranging from 1 to 2 in Banach spaces. By using the properties of cosine and sine family operators, along with the generalized Laplace transform, we derive a more concise expression for the mild solution. This expression is formulated as an integral, incorporating Mainardi's Wright-type function. Furthermore, we provide various valuable properties associated with the operators present in the mild solution. Additionally, employing the fixed-point technique and Gr\"{o}nwall's inequality, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the mild solution. To illustrate our results, we conclude with an example of a time-fractional equation, presenting the expression for its corresponding mild solution.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wright Analysis in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a broad class of non-Gaussian measures, $ \mu_\Psi$, associated with a family of generalized Wright functions, $_m\Psi_q$. First, we study these measures in Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$, then define them in an abstract nuclear triple $\mathcal{N}\subset\mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{N}'$. We study analyticity, invariance properties, and ergodicity under a particular group of automorphisms. Then we show the existence of an Appell system which allows the extension of the non-Gaussian Hilbert space $L^2(\mu_\Psi)$ to the nuclear triple consisting of test functions' and distributions' spaces, $(\mathcal{N})^{1}\subset L^2(\mu_\Psi)\subset(\mathcal{N})_{\mu_\Psi}^{-1}$. Furthermore, thanks to the definition of two transformations, $S_{\mu_{\Psi}}$ and $T_{\mu_{\Psi}}$, we study Donsker's delta as an element within $(\mathcal{N})_{\mu_\Psi}^{-1}$ applying the integral equations fulfilled by $_m\Psi_q$.</description>
