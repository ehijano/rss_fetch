      <title>The Computational Complexity of Formal Reasoning for Encoder-Only Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate challenges and possibilities of formal reasoning for encoder-only transformers (EOT), meaning sound and complete methods for verifying or interpreting behaviour. In detail, we condense related formal reasoning tasks in the form of a naturally occurring satisfiability problem (SAT). We find that SAT is undecidable if we consider EOT, commonly considered in the expressiveness community. Furthermore, we identify practical scenarios where SAT is decidable and establish corresponding complexity bounds. Besides trivial cases, we find that quantized EOT, namely those restricted by some fixed-width arithmetic, lead to the decidability of SAT due to their limited attention capabilities. However, the problem remains difficult, as we establish those scenarios where SAT is NEXPTIME-hard and those where we can show that it is solvable in NEXPTIME for quantized EOT. To complement our theoretical results, we put our findings and their implications in the overall perspective of formal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable. In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability. Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage. Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting. These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations. They are, however, limited in that they only support $\ell^2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks. This paper introduces \emph{VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction)}, a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$, as well as regression tasks. We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments. In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.</description>

      <title>Groupoidal Realizability for Intensional Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop realizability models of intensional type theory, based on groupoids, wherein realizers themselves carry non-trivial (non-discrete) homotopical structure. In the spirit of realizability, this is intended to formalize a homotopical BHK interpretation, whereby evidence for an identification is a path. Specifically, we study partitioned groupoidal assemblies. Categories of such are parameterised by "realizer categories" (instead of the usual partial combinatory algebras) that come equipped with an interval qua internal cogroupoid. The interval furnishes a notion of homotopy as well as a fundamental groupoid construction. Objects in a base groupoid are realized by points in the fundamental groupoid of some object from the realizer category; isomorphisms in the base groupoid are realized by paths in said fundamental groupoid. The main result is that, under mild conditions on the realizer category, the ensuing category of partitioned groupoidal assemblies models intensional (1-truncated) type theory without function extensionality. Moreover, when the underlying realizer category is "untyped", there exists an impredicative universe of 1-types (the modest fibrations). This is a groupoidal analogue of the traditional situation.</description>

      <title>The Precise Complexity of Reasoning in $\mathcal{ALC}$ with $\omega$-Admissible Concrete Domains (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concrete domains have been introduced in the context of Description Logics to allow references to qualitative and quantitative values. In particular, the class of $\omega$-admissible concrete domains, which includes Allen's interval algebra, the region connection calculus (RCC8), and the rational numbers with ordering and equality, has been shown to yield extensions of $\mathcal{ALC}$ for which concept satisfiability w.r.t. a general TBox is decidable. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on type elimination and use it to show that deciding the consistency of an $\mathcal{ALC}(\mathfrak{D})$ ontology is ExpTime-complete if the concrete domain $\mathfrak{D}$ is $\omega$-admissible and its constraint satisfaction problem is decidable in exponential time.
  While this allows us to reason with concept and role assertions, we also investigate feature assertions $f(a,c)$ that can specify a constant $c$ as the value of a feature $f$ for an individual $a$. We show that, under conditions satisfied by all known $\omega$-admissible domains, we can add feature assertions without affecting the complexity.</description>

      <title>Which are the True Defeasible Logics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of defeasible logics is only vaguely defined -- it is defined by a few exemplars and the general idea of efficient reasoning with defeasible rules. The recent definition of the defeasible logic $DL(\partial_{||})$ introduced new features to such logics, which have repercussions that we explore. In particular, we define a class of logics that accommodates the new logic while retaining the traditional properties of defeasible logics.</description>

      <title>Formalising the Local Compactness of the Adele Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adele ring of a number field is a central object in modern number theory. Its status as a locally compact topological ring is one of the key reasons why, leading to its widespread use within the Langlands Program. We describe a formal proof that the adele ring of a number field is locally compact in the Lean 4 theorem prover. Our work includes the formalisations of new types, including the completion of a number field at an infinite place and the finite $S$-adele ring, as well as formal proofs that completions of a number field are locally compact and their rings of integers at finite places are compact.</description>

      <title>Approximating Human Models During Argumentation-based Dialogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) aims to develop AI agents that can effectively explain their decisions and actions to human users, fostering trust and facilitating human-AI collaboration. A key challenge in XAIP is model reconciliation, which seeks to align the mental models of AI agents and humans. While existing approaches often assume a known and deterministic human model, this simplification may not capture the complexities and uncertainties of real-world interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enables AI agents to learn and update a probabilistic human model through argumentation-based dialogues. Our approach incorporates trust-based and certainty-based update mechanisms, allowing the agent to refine its understanding of the human's mental state based on the human's expressed trust in the agent's arguments and certainty in their own arguments. We employ a probability weighting function inspired by prospect theory to capture the relationship between trust and perceived probability, and use a Bayesian approach to update the agent's probability distribution over possible human models. We conduct a human-subject study to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in an argumentation scenario, demonstrating its ability to capture the dynamics of human belief formation and adaptation.</description>

      <title>On the formalization of the notion of an interactive algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An earlier paper gives an account of a quest for a satisfactory formalization of the classical informal notion of an algorithm. In this paper, an attempt is made to generalize the results of that quest to the informal notion of an interactive algorithm. The notion of an interactive proto-algorithm is introduced. Interactive algorithms are expected to be equivalence classes of interactive proto-algorithms under an appropriate equivalence relation. As in the non-interactive case, three equivalence relations are defined. Two of them are deemed to be bounds for an appropriate equivalence relation and the third is likely an appropriate one.</description>

      <title>Finite-Choice Logic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logic programming, as exemplified by datalog, defines the meaning of a program as the canonical smallest model derived from deductive closure over its inference rules. However, many problems call for an enumeration of models that vary along some set of choices while maintaining structural and logical constraints -- there is no single canonical model. The notion of stable models has successfully captured programmer intuition about the set of valid solutions for such problems, giving rise to a family of programming languages and associated solvers collectively known as answer set programming. Unfortunately, the definition of a stable model is frustratingly indirect, especially in the presence of rules containing free variables.
  We propose a new formalism, called finite-choice logic programing, for which the set of stable models can be characterized as the least fixed point of an immediate consequence operator. Our formalism allows straightforward expression of common idioms in both datalog and answer set programming, gives meaning to a new and useful class of programs, enjoys a constructive and direct operational semantics, and admits a predictive cost semantics, which we demonstrate through our implementation.</description>

      <title>Set Descriptive Complexity of Solvable Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, we introduced and studied a precise class of dynamical systems called solvable systems. These systems present a dynamic ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with solvable right-hand terms and unique evolution. They correspond to a class of systems for which a transfinite method exist to compute the solution. We also presented several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems might describe ordinal Turing computations. In the current article, we study in more depth solvable systems, using tools from descriptive set theory. By establishing a correspondence with the class of well-founded trees, we construct a coanalytic ranking over the set of solvable functions and discuss its relation with other existing rankings for differentiable functions, in particular with the Kechris-Woodin, Denjoy and Zalcwasser ranking. We prove that our ranking is unbounded below the first uncountable ordinal.</description>

      <title>Semitopology: a survey of a topological approach to distributed collaborative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09287v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce semitopologies, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open. The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing. This paper presents a mathematics that is inspired by these considerations. It is interesting in and of itself, much like point-set topology is; and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Semiframes: algebras of heterogeneous consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semitopologies model consensus in distributed system by equating the notion of a quorum -- a set of participants sufficient to make local progress -- with that of an open set. This yields a topology-like theory of consensus, but semitopologies generalise topologies, since the intersection of two quorums need not necessarily be a quorum. The semitopological model of consensus is naturally heterogeneous and local, just like topologies can be heterogenous and local, and for the same reasons: points may have different quorums and there is no restriction that open sets / quorums be uniformly generated (e.g. open sets can be something other than two-thirds majorities of the points in the space).
  Semiframes are an algebraic abstraction of semitopologies. They are to semitopologies as frames are to topologies. We give a notion of semifilter, which plays a role analogous to filters, and show how to build a semiframe out of the open sets of a semitopology, and a semitopology out of the semifilters of a semiframe.
  We define suitable notions of category and morphism and prove a categorical duality between (sober) semiframes and (spatial) semitopologies, and investigate well-behavedness properties on semitopologies and semiframes across the duality. Surprisingly, the structure of semiframes is not what one might initially expect just from looking at semitopologies, and the canonical structure required for the duality result -- a compatibility relation *, generalising sets intersection -- is also canonical for expressing well-behavedness properties.
  Overall, we deliver a new categorical, algebraic, abstract framework within which to study consensus on distributed systems, and which is also simply interesting to consider as a mathematical theory in its own right.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Universality in Physics, Computer Science, and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turing machines and spin models share a notion of universality according to which some simulate all others. Is there a theory of universality that captures this notion? We set up a categorical framework for universality which includes as instances universal Turing machines, universal spin models, NP completeness, top of a preorder, denseness of a subset, and more. By identifying necessary conditions for universality, we show that universal spin models cannot be finite. We also characterize when universality can be distinguished from a trivial one and use it to show that universal Turing machines are non-trivial in this sense. Our framework allows not only to compare universalities within each instance, but also instances themselves. We leverage a Fixed Point Theorem inspired by a result of Lawvere to establish that universality and negation give rise to unreachability (such as uncomputability). As such, this work sets the basis for a unified approach to universality and invites the study of further examples within the framework.</description>

      <title>Learning Better Representations From Less Data For Propositional Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training neural networks on NP-complete problems typically demands very large amounts of training data and often needs to be coupled with computationally expensive symbolic verifiers to ensure output correctness. In this paper, we present NeuRes, a neuro-symbolic approach to address both challenges for propositional satisfiability, being the quintessential NP-complete problem. By combining certificate-driven training and expert iteration, our model learns better representations than models trained for classification only, with a much higher data efficiency -- requiring orders of magnitude less training data. NeuRes employs propositional resolution as a proof system to generate proofs of unsatisfiability and to accelerate the process of finding satisfying truth assignments, exploring both possibilities in parallel. To realize this, we propose an attention-based architecture that autoregressively selects pairs of clauses from a dynamic formula embedding to derive new clauses. Furthermore, we employ expert iteration whereby model-generated proofs progressively replace longer teacher proofs as the new ground truth. This enables our model to reduce a dataset of proofs generated by an advanced solver by ~32% after training on it with no extra guidance. This shows that NeuRes is not limited by the optimality of the teacher algorithm owing to its self-improving workflow. We show that our model achieves far better performance than NeuroSAT in terms of both correctly classified and proven instances.</description>

Jacobs' comprehension categories, and generalise it to the non-discrete case. The classical equivalence can be summarised in the slogan: "terms as sections". By recognising "terms as coalgebras", we show how to use the structure-semantics adjunction to prove that a 2-category of comprehension categories is biequivalent to a 2-category of (non-discrete) categories with families. The biequivalence restricts to the classical one proved by Hofmann in the discrete case. It also provides a framework where to compare different morphisms of these structures that have appeared in the literature, varying on the degree of preservation of the relevant structure. We consider in particular morphisms defined by Claraimbault-Dybjer, Jacobs, Larrea, and Uemura.</description>

Abstract: Currently, there is a gap between the tools used by probability theorists and those used in formal reasoning about probabilistic programs. On the one hand, a probability theorist decomposes probabilistic state along the simple and natural product of probability spaces. On the other hand, recently developed probabilistic separation logics decompose state via relatively unfamiliar measure-theoretic constructions for computing unions of sigma-algebras and probability measures. We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos. Through this equivalence, we validate design decisions in prior work on probabilistic separation logic and create new connections to nominal-set-like models of probability.</description>
