      <title>Bulk derivation of TQFT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a general derivation of holographic duality between "TQFT gravity" - the path integral of a 3d TQFT summed over different topologies - and an ensemble of boundary 2d CFTs. The key idea is to place the boundary ensemble on a Riemann surface of very high genus, where the duality trivializes. The duality relation at finite genus is then obtained by genus reduction. Our derivation is generic and does not rely on an explicit form of the bulk or boundary partition functions. It guarantees unitarity and suggests that the bulk sum should include all possible topologies. In the case of Abelian Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group we show that the weights of the boundary ensemble are equal, while the bulk sum reduces to a finite sum over equivalence classes of topologies, represented by handlebodies with possible line defects.</description>

      <title>Waves and strings in an interacting conformal chiral 2-form theory in six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In six dimensions there exists a unique one-parameter family of non-linear conformal electrodynamics for a chiral 2-form gauge field which includes (in a free-field limit) the linear chiral 2-form theory and is related, by dimensional reduction, to the four-dimensional ModMax electrodynamics. In this work, we present the first exact solutions of this theory in presence of gravity. In particular, we will consider plane-wave, Robinson-Trautman, and self-dual dyonic string configurations, generalizing well-known solutions of this type in six-dimensional supergravities with linear chiral 2-form multiplets.</description>

      <title>The eclectic flavor symmetries of $\mathbb{T}^2/\mathbb{Z}_K$ orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only four $\mathbb{T}^2/\mathbb{Z}_K$ orbifold building blocks are admissible in heterotic string compactifications. We investigate the flavor properties of all of these building blocks. In each case, we identify the traditional and modular flavor symmetries, and determine the corresponding representations and (fractional) modular weights of the available massless matter states. The resulting finite flavor symmetries include Abelian and non-Abelian traditional symmetries, discrete $R$ symmetries, as well as the double-covered finite modular groups $(S_3\times S_3)\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_4$, $T'$, $2D_3$ and $S_3\times T'$. Our findings provide restrictions for bottom-up model building with consistent ultraviolet embeddings.</description>

      <title>The Absolute Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``Swampland Program'' aims to discriminate consistent-looking effective field theories that do not admit a UV completion in quantum gravity from those that do. While most often developed under the umbrella of string theory, several swampland criteria have been explored also in other contexts, especially asymptotically safe gravity. A comparison between different approaches can help to clarify the dependence of low-energy constraints on UV physics and thereby shed light on the universality of quantum gravity itself. In this short review we summarise what is known about three important swampland conjectures in string theory and in asymptotic safety. We point out future lines of research that can help to understand to what extent swampland conjectures are absolute, i.e. hold in quantum gravity in general, or relative, i.e. belong only to a specific UV framework.</description>

      <title>On the D5-brane description of $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the probe D5-brane solution in $AdS_5\times S^5$ dual to the $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS latitude Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory in the $k$-antisymmetric representation of $SU(N)$. The solution is exact in the latitude parameter $\theta_0$ and correctly reproduces the $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS limit. We compute the string charge $k$ and the renormalized on-shell action perturbatively to order $\mathcal{O}\left(\theta_0^{10}\right)$ and find full agreement with the expectation value of the Wilson loop predicted by the Gaussian matrix model in the limit $N\sim k\to\infty$, $\lambda\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-corrected anti-de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the back-reaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a massless, conformally-coupled quantum scalar field on global AdS space-time in four space-time dimensions acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We solve the quantum-corrected Einstein equations numerically and find deviations from pure AdS which increase as the temperature of the quantum scalar field state increases. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons, and study the mass of these solitons as a function of the temperature of the quantum scalar field.</description>

      <title>The four-components link invariant in the framework of topological field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we undertake a perturbative analysis of the topological non-Abelian Chern-Simons-Wong model with the aim to explicitly construct the second-order on-shell action. The resulting action is a topological quantity depending solely on closed curves, so it correspond to an analytical expression of a link invariant. Additionally, we construct an Abelian model that reproduces the same second-order on-shell action as its non-Abelian Chern-Simons-Wong counterpart so it functions as an intermediate model, featuring Abelian fields generated by currents supported on closed paths. By geometrically analyzing each term, we demonstrate that this topological invariant effectively detects the knotting of a four-component link.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the nonabelian dipole problem in the context of a simple semiclassical approach which incorporates some essential features of the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, in particular, the fact that the running coupling remains of moderate size at infrared scales. We obtain a simple flux-tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, that we compare to the results of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Efimov effect of quantized vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-body problem, from the chaotic motions of celestial bodies to complex microscopic particle interactions, has always been one of the most foundational yet intricate challenges in physics since its establishment. A key breakthrough in this domain is the Efimov effect, which represents a significant stride in what is now known as Efimov physics. Our study uncovers a macroscopic Efimov effect in a three-component Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) system. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, it is verified that under certain conditions, three vortices form a bound state, while removing one vortex causes the others to unbind, demonstrating topological characteristics similar to the Borromean rings, hence termed the `vortex Efimov effect', signifying a novel topological phase transition. We propose several experimental approaches to realize this macroscopic Efimov effect, paving new paths not only in many-body physics but also in exploring quantum phase transitions and applications in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Compressibility of dense nuclear matter in the $\rho$-meson variant of the Skyrme model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that coupling the $\textrm{SU}(2)$-valued Skyrme field to the $\rho$-meson solves the long-standing issue of (in)compressibility in the solitonic Skyrme model. Even by including only one $\rho\pi$ interaction term, motivated by a holographic-like reduction of Yang-Mills action by Sutcliffe, reduces the compression modulus from $K_0 \simeq 1080$ MeV, in the massive Skyrme model, to $K_0\simeq 351$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Modified Euler-Heisenberg effective action and Proper-Time Method in Lorentz-Violating Scalar QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum photon effects in vacuum provide an interesting setting to test quantum electrodynamics, serving as a source for predictions about physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate these effects by calculating the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like effective action within a Lorentz-violating scalar quantum electrodynamics framework. In both CPT-even and CPT-odd scenarios, we obtain the exact result in all orders of the stress tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ and evaluate explicitly the lower orders of this effective action. We identify the quantum effects coming from Lorentz violation in an explicitly gauge invariant way. Nonlinear Lorentz-violating contributions that may affect photon-photon scattering are explicitly evaluated.</description>

      <title>Finite-size spectrum of the staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite-size spectrum of the critical staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions is studied. Similar to the case of periodic boundary conditions, we identify three different phases. In two of those, the underlying conformal field theory can be identified to be related to the twisted $U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebra. In contrast, the finite size scaling in the third regime, whose critical behaviour with the quasi-periodic BCs is described by the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ black hole CFT possessing a non-compact degree of freedom, is more subtle. Here with antidiagonal BCs imposed, the corrections to the scaling of the ground state grow logarithmically with the system size, while the energy gaps appear to close logarithmically. Moreover, we obtain an explicit formula for the Q-operator which is useful for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Generating Triangulations and Fibrations with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning (RL) to generate fine regular star triangulations of reflexive polytopes, that give rise to smooth Calabi-Yau (CY) hypersurfaces. We demonstrate that, by simple modifications to the data encoding and reward function, one can search for CYs that satisfy a set of desirable string compactification conditions. For instance, we show that our RL algorithm can generate triangulations together with holomorphic vector bundles that satisfy anomaly cancellation and poly-stability conditions in heterotic compactification. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be used to search for reflexive subpolytopes together with compatible triangulations that define fibration structures of the CYs.</description>

      <title>Scale hierarchies near the conifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the axio-dilaton and complex structure stabilization for a generic one-parameter Calabi-Yau (CY) compactification. We focus on near the conifold regions and consider a strongly warped metric. We analyze numerically the case of the mirror of the quintic CY. The axio-dilaton $\tau$ and complex structure $z$ moduli are stabilized simultaneously comparing with previous results, showing that generically $z$ is heavier than $\tau$, and the axio-dilaton can not be fixed first. This is also the case when we add the warping correction to the potential; and in general this inclusion does not destabilize the moduli. We point out why in this setup non-supersymmetric vacua are much more dense than supersymmetric vacua. We study the dependence of the vacua stabilization by addition of an $\overline{D3}$-brane, for a fixed volume. The vacuum state masses have divergent eigenvalues near the conifold singularity that gets softened by the warping correction. Generically the considered contributions allow to find stable vacua in this setup. The scale hierarchy between 6D and 4D; arising from the warping, as stated by Giddings Kachru and Polchinski (GKP), is preserved; while the masses in the vacua acquire physically reasonable values.</description>

      <title>On the number of Regge trajectories for dual amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regge poles connect the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes, analytically continued in spin, to the high-energy limit in momentum space. Dual models are expected to have only Regge poles, and string theory suggests there should be an infinite number of them. In this study, we investigate the number of Regge trajectories these models may have. We prove, based solely on crossing symmetry and unitarity, that meromorphic amplitudes, with or without subtractions, cannot produce a reggeizing amplitude if they contain any finite number of Regge trajectories. We argue that this should exclude the existence of such amplitudes altogether. Additionally, we develop and apply a linear programming dual bootstrap method to exclude these amplitudes directly in momentum space.</description>

      <title>A new look at AdS black holes with conformal scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18048v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit static, spherically symmetric solutions to AdS-Einstein gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field (and no self-interaction potential) in four dimensions. We first observe that a convenient choice of coordinates leads to a significant simplification of the field equations, which enables one to identify various roots of the indicial equations and thus distinct branches of solutions. Next, we construct an explicit 2-parameter hairy black hole solution in terms of an infinite power series around the event horizon. The black hole is non-extremal with a regular scalar field on and outside the event horizon, and it reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS metric in the limit of vanishing hair. Its properties are illustrated for various values of the parameters and compared with previous numerical results by other authors. In addition, the analysis reveals the presence of a photon sphere and how the scalar field affects its size and the angular radius of the corresponding shadow. The thermodynamics of the solution is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of generalized quantum histories allows a symmetrical treatment of space and time correlations, by taking different traces of the same history density matrix. We recall how to characterize spatial and temporal entanglement in this framework. An operative protocol is presented, to map a history state into the ket of a static composite system. We show, by examples, how the Leggett-Garg and the temporal CHSH inequalities can be violated in our approach.</description>

      <title>Teaching ideal quantum measurement, from dynamics to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graduate course on ideal measurements, analyzed as dynamical processes of interaction between the tested system S and an apparatus A, described by quantum statistical mechanics. The apparatus A=M+B involves a macroscopic measuring device M and a bath B. The requirements for ideality of the measurement allow us to specify the Hamiltonian of the isolated compound system S+M+B. The resulting dynamical equations may be solved for simple models. Conservation laws are shown to entail two independent relaxation mechanisms: truncation and registration. Approximations, justified by the large size of M and of B, are needed. The final density matrix $\hat{\cal D}(t_f)$ of S+A has an equilibrium form. It describes globally the outcome of a large set of runs of the measurement. The measurement problem, i.e., extracting physical properties of individual runs from $\hat{\cal D}(t_f)$, then arises due to the ambiguity of its splitting into parts associated with subsets of runs. To deal with this ambiguity, we postulate that each run ends up with a distinct pointer value $A_i$ of the macroscopic M. This is compatible with the principles of quantum mechanics. Born's rule then arises from the conservation law for the tested observable; it expresses the frequency of occurrence of the final indications $A_i$ of M in terms of the initial state of S. Von Neumann's reduction amounts to updating of information due to selection of $A_i$. We advocate the terms $q$-probabilities and $q$-correlations when analyzing measurements of non-commuting observables. These ideas may be adapted to different types of courses.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetry and Exotic Hall Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fractionalization of non-invertible symmetry in (2+1)D topological orders. We focus on coset non-invertible symmetries obtained by gauging non-normal subgroups of invertible $0$-form symmetries. These symmetries can arise as global symmetries in quantum spin liquids, given by the quotient of the projective symmetry group by a non-normal subgroup as invariant gauge group. We point out that such coset non-invertible symmetries in topological orders can exhibit symmetry fractionalization: each anyon can carry a "fractional charge" under the coset non-invertible symmetry given by a gauge invariant superposition of fractional quantum numbers. We present various examples using field theories and quantum double lattice models, such as fractional quantum Hall systems with charge conjugation symmetry gauged and finite group gauge theory from gauging a non-normal subgroup. They include symmetry enriched $S_3$ and $O(2)$ gauge theories. We show that such systems have a fractionalized continuous non-invertible coset symmetry and a well-defined electric Hall conductance. The coset symmetry enforces a gapless edge state if the boundary preserves the continuous non-invertible symmetry. We propose a general approach for constructing coset symmetry defects using a "sandwich" construction: non-invertible symmetry defects can generally be constructed from an invertible defect sandwiched by condensation defects. The anomaly free condition for finite coset symmetry is also identified.</description>

Abstract: We explore the introduction of the cosmological constant via equivalent transformations in cosmology. We consider the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the CDM universe and we construct the Hamilton-Jacobi action for the $\Lambda$CDM model. We discuss how this approach allows us to relate different physical systems, providing insights into the role of the cosmological constant in cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Generalized uncertainty principles are effective changes to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that emerge in several quantum gravity models. In the present letter, we study the consequences that two classes of these modifications yield on the physics of neutrinos. Besides analyzing the change in the oscillation probabilities that the generalized uncertainty principles entail, we assess their impact on the neutrino coherence length and their possible interpretation as nonstandard neutrino interactions. Constraints cast by present and planned neutrino experiments on the generalized uncertainty principles parameters are also derived.</description>

      <title>Revisiting quantum field theory in Rindler spacetime with superselection rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) in Rindler spacetime is a gateway to understanding unitarity and information loss paradoxes in curved spacetime. Rindler coordinates map Minkowski spacetime onto regions with horizons, effectively dividing accelerated observers into causally disconnected sectors. Employing standard quantum field theory techniques and Bogoliubov transformations between Minkowski and Rindler coordinates yields entanglement between states across these causally separated regions of spacetime. This results in a breakdown of unitarity, implying that information regarding the entangled partner may be irretrievably lost beyond the Rindler horizon. As a consequence, one has a situation of pure states evolving into mixed states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for comprehending this phenomenon using a recently proposed formulation of direct-sum quantum field theory (DQFT), which is grounded in superselection rules formulated by the parity and time reversal ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. In the context of DQFT applied to Rindler spacetime, we demonstrate that each Rindler observer can, in principle, access pure states within the horizon, thereby restoring unitarity. However, our analysis also reveals the emergence of a thermal spectrum of Unruh radiation. This prompts a reevaluation of entanglement in Rindler spacetime, where we propose a novel perspective on how Rindler observers may reconstruct complementary information beyond the horizon. Furthermore, we revisit the implications of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem within the framework of DQFT. Lastly, we underscore how our findings contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at elucidating the role of unitarity in quantum field theory within the context of de Sitter and black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of observables such as the Hamiltonian play a central role in quantum mechanics. Inspired by the pure Nash equilibria that arise in classical game theory, we propose ''Nash states'' of multiple observables as a generalization of eigenstates of single observables. This generalization is mathematically natural for many-body quantum systems, which possess an intrinsic tensor product structure. Every set of observables gives rise to algebraic varieties of Nash state vectors that we call ''Nash varieties''. We present analytical and numerical results on the existence of Nash states and on the geometry of Nash varieties. We relate these ideas to earlier, pioneering work on the Nash equilibria of few-body quantum games and discuss connections to the variational minimization of local Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of physical subsystems in quantum mechanics as compared to classical mechanics poses significant conceptual challenges, especially in the context of quantum gravity. Traditional approaches associate quantum systems with classical ones localized in spacetime, using either Hilbert space factors for finite-dimensional systems or local operator algebras in algebraic quantum field theory. These methods ensure statistical independence for state preparations and measurements. However, canonical linearized quantum gravity disrupts this framework by preventing the formation of gauge-invariant local algebras, thereby undermining the statistical independence required in measurements. This presents a major obstacle for modeling early universe cosmology, gravity-induced-entanglement experiments, and poses a significant roadblock toward a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity. A pivotal shift is proposed: the identification of classical and quantum systems should be dynamically evolving rather than static, opening the possibility of a single-world unitary quantum mechanics. This perspective aligns with the broader aim of understanding how classical spatiotemporal existence emerges from quantum mechanics and connects the measurement problem with quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: According to the inflationary theory of cosmology, most elementary particles in the current universe were created during a period of reheating after inflation. In this work we self-consistently couple the Einstein-inflaton equations to a strongly coupled quantum field theory (QFT) as described by holography. We show that this leads to an inflating universe, a reheating phase and finally a universe dominated by the QFT in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On energy and particle production in cosmology: the particular case of the gravitino</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the number of particles produced in cosmology, commonly defined in the literature from the Fock space of the instantaneous hamiltonian of the canonically normalized fields, is ambiguous. On the other hand, the energy computed from the energy-momentum tensor should be physical. We compare the corresponding Fock spaces and relate them through a Bogolyubov transformation. We find that for particles of spin $0$, $1$ and $3/2$ the two Fock spaces are different, whereas they are the same for spin $1/2$ fermions. For spin $0$ and $1$, for particles of high momenta the two Fock spaces align, as intuitively expected. For the spin $3/2$, one finds two puzzles. The first one is that the two corresponding Fock spaces do not match even in the limit of high momenta. The second is that whereas we provide evidence for the equivalence theorem between longitudinal gravitinos and the goldstino in terms of an exact matching between the lagrangians and the instantaneous hamiltonians for the canonically normalized fields, the energy operator computed from the Rarita--Schwinger action does not seem to be captured in a simple way by the goldstino action. Our results suggest a re-analysis of non-thermal gravitino production in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Conservative Scattering of Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes at Third Post-Minkowskian Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a recently developed effective field theory formalism for extreme mass ratios [2308.14832], we present a calculation of charged black hole scattering at third post-Minkowskian order. The charges and masses are kept arbitrary, and the result interpolates from the scattering of Schwarzschild to extremal charged black holes, and beyond to charged particles in electrodynamics -- agreeing with previously reported results in all such limits. The computation of the radial action is neatly organized in powers of the mass ratio. The probe (0SF) contributions are readily computed by direct integration of the radial momentum, and we use the effective field theory to compute the subleading (1SF) contributions via background-field Feynman rules supplemented by an operator encoding recoil of the background. Together these contributions completely determine the conservative physics at order~$\mathcal{O}(G^{3})$.</description>

      <title>The unitary Fermi gas at large charge and large N</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the unitary Fermi gas in a harmonic trapping potential starting from a microscopic theory in the limit of large charge and large number of fermion flavors N. In this regime, we present an algorithmic procedure for extracting data from perturbation theory, order-by-order, without the need for other assumptions. We perform a gradient expansion in the interior of the particle cloud, sufficiently far from the cloud edge where the particle density drops rapidly to zero. In this latter region we present the first microscopic computation characterizing the contribution of the edge terms. The microscopic theory reproduces the predictions of the superfluid EFT, including the action, the form of the gap equation, and the energy of the system in a harmonic trap (which maps, via the non-relativistic state-operator correspondence, to the scaling dimension of the lowest operator of charge Q). We additionally give the Wilsonian coefficients at leading order in N up to NNLO in the large-charge expansion.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalized $\phi^4$ model that gives rise to BPS kink/antikink configurations with compacton-like profiles. One observes that the positive parameter controlling the generalizing function promotes an infinity degenerescence of the BPS solutions. We then use the Differential Configurational Complexity technique to distinguish the degenerate configurations, which allows us to obtain the parameter values providing the most likely field profiles. Besides, the analysis of the excitation spectrum of the model shows the existence of translational and vibrational modes. Thus, the emergence of bound states of solitons (bions) and resonance phenomena is guaranteed when analyzing the scattering of kink/antikink structures. In this way, one notes that depending on the initial velocity, the collision can be inelastic or quasi-elastic, even in the case of compacton-like configurations.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we performed a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models involving $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals. The realization was derived and studied by using Ward identities, which do not allow one to fix integration contours, these latter were chosen to be real axis for one $\beta$-ensemble and imaginary axis for the other one basing on some particular checks. Here, we evaluate the $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly using a conjecture by I.G. Macdonald, and explain that another choice of integration contours is also possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: U-duality imposes strong constraints on the structure of divergences in supergravity. But Gaillard-Zumino Sp$(2n_v, \mathbb{R})$ duality in D=4 has more symmetries than U-duality. For example, in $N = 8$ the dimension of Sp(56) is 1596, whereas its U-duality subgroup $E_{7(7)}$ has a dimension of 133. In comparison, in D $&gt; 4$ maximal dualities are U-dualities. We argue that the extra dualities in 4D, enhancing U-duality, determine the properties of perturbative quantum supergravity. The presence/absence of enhanced dualities suggests a possible explanation of the results of the amplitude loop computations in D-dimensional supergravities and of the special status of D = 4 in this respect.</description>

      <title>Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential energy from a time-dependent scalar field provides a possible explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration. In this paper, we investigate how data from supernova and bary acoustic oscillation surveys constrain the possible evolution of a single scalar field over the period of time (roughly half the age of the universe) for which these data are available. Taking a linear approximation to the scalar potential $V(\phi) = V_0 + V_1 \phi$ around the present value, a likelihood analysis appears to significantly prefer models with a decreasing potential energy at present, with approximately $99.99 \%$ of the $\exp(-\chi^2/2)$ distribution having $V_1 &gt; 0$ in a convention where $\dot{\phi} \le 0$ at present. The models favoured by the distribution typically have an order one decrease $\langle |{\rm Range}[V(\phi(t))] / V(t_0)| \rangle \approx 0.36$ in the scalar potential energy over the time frame corresponding to $z &lt; 2$. According to the likelihood analysis, the $\Lambda$CDM model with no variation in dark energy appears to be significantly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential model, but this should be interpreted cautiously since model selection criteria that make use of $\Delta \chi^2$ while ignoring parameter space volumes still favour $\Lambda$CDM. Working with a second order approximation to the potential, the supernova data can be fit well for a wide range of possible potentials, including models where the universe has already stopped accelerating.</description>

The sum rules can be found in full generality by considering the properties of solutions to the Sturm-Liouville problem, which describes the wave functions and the masses of the KK-gravitons in four dimensions. They ensure cancellations in the amplitudes of the processes mentioned above which considerably reduce their growth with $s$ in the high-energy limit. This protects extra-dimensional theories from the low-scale unitarity problems that plague other theories with massive spin-2 particles. We argue that such relations are valid for a broader category of models thus generalizing our previous results that were limited to the large $\mu$ limit of the Randall-Sundrum model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic superstrings and gauge strings</title>

Abstract: We perform a phenomenological comparison of the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum expected from cosmic gauge string networks and superstring networks comprised of multiple string types. We show how violations of scaling behavior and the evolution of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe affect the GW spectrum. We derive simple analytical expressions for the GW spectrum from superstrings and gauge strings that are valid for all frequencies relevant to pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and laser interferometers. We analyze the latest data from PTAs and show that superstring networks are consistent with 32 nHz data from NANOGrav, but are excluded by 3.2 nHz data at $3\sigma$ unless the string coupling $g_s&lt;0.2$ or the strings evolve in only about 10\% of the volume of the higher-dimensional space. We also point out that while gauge string networks are excluded by NANOGrav-15 data at $3\sigma$, they are completely compatible with EPTA and PPTA data. Finally, we study correlations between GW signals at PTAs and laser interferometers.</description>

      <title>A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.</description>

      <title>PySymmPol: Symmetric Polynomials in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PySymmPol is a Python package designed for efficient manipulation of symmetric polynomials. It provides functionalities for working with various types of symmetric polynomials, including elementary, homogeneous, monomial symmetric, (skew-) Schur, and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. In addition to polynomial operations, PySymmPol offers tools to explore key properties of integer partitions and Young diagrams, such as transposition, Frobenius coordinates, characters of symmetric groups and others.</description>
