      <title>Spatially Resolved Electron Number Density Measurements Via Coherent Microwave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on the use of coherent microwave scattering (CMS) for spatially resolved electron number density measurements of elongated plasma structures induced at mid-IR femtosecond filamentation. The presented studies comprise one-dimensional mapping of laser filaments induced via 3.9 um, 127.3 fs laser pulses at output energies up to 15 mJ. The axial electron number density and laser intensity were measured to be invariant along the entire filament length for the tested laser pulse energies 5-15 mJ (2x$10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 30-40 TW/cm$^2$, respectively) which supports that intensity clamping conditions were achieved in the experiments. The proposed approach enables unprecedented, currently unavailable capabilities to conduct direct, absolute, and longitudinally resolved measurements of electron number density in laser filaments and to precisely characterize conditions associated with self-focusing and intensity clamping.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of the self-similar supersonic Marshak wave problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the similarity solutions for the Marshak wave problem, in the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) diffusion approximation and in the supersonic regime. Self-similar solutions exist for a temporal power law surface temperature drive and a material model with power law temperature dependent opacity and energy density. The properties of the solutions in both linear and nonlinear conduction regimes are studied as a function of the temporal drive, opacity and energy density exponents. We show that there exists a range of the temporal exponent for which the total energy in the system decreases, and the solution has a local maxima. For nonlinear conduction, we specify the conditions on the opacity and energy density exponents under which the heat front is linear or even flat, and does posses its common sharp character; this character is independent of the drive exponent. We specify the values of the temporal exponents for which analytical solutions exist and employ the Hammer-Rosen perturbation theory to obtain highly accurate approximate solutions, which are parameterized using only two numerically fitted quantities. The solutions are used to construct a set of benchmarks for supersonic LTE radiative heat transfer, including some with unusual and interesting properties such as local maxima and non sharp fronts. The solutions are compared in detail to implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations as well gray diffusion simulations, showing a good agreement, which highlights their usefulness as a verification test problem for radiative transfer simulations.</description>

      <title>The Velocity-Space Signature of Transit-Time Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transit-time damping (TTD) is a process in which the magnetic mirror force -- induced by the parallel gradient of magnetic field strength -- interacts with resonant plasma particles in a time-varying magnetic field, leading to the collisionless damping of electromagnetic waves and the resulting energization of those particles through the perpendicular component of the electric field, $E_\perp$. In this study, we utilize the recently developed field-particle correlation technique to analyze gyrokinetic simulation data. This method enables the identification of the velocity-space structure of the TTD energy transfer rate between waves and particles during the damping of plasma turbulence. Our analysis reveals a unique bipolar pattern of energy transfer in velocity space characteristic of TTD. By identifying this pattern, we provide clear evidence of TTD's significant role in the damping of strong plasma turbulence. Additionally, we compare the TTD signature with that of Landau damping (LD). Although they both produce a bipolar pattern of phase-space energy density loss and gain about the parallel resonant velocity of the Alfv\'enic waves, they are mediated by different forces and exhibit different behaviors as $v_\perp \to 0$. We also explore how the dominant damping mechanism varies with ion plasma beta $\beta_i$, showing that TTD dominates over LD for $\beta_i &gt; 1$. This work deepens our understanding of the role of TTD in the damping of weakly collisional plasma turbulence and paves the way to seek the signature of TTD using \emph{in situ} spacecraft observations of turbulence in space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Core performance predictions in projected SPARC first-campaign plasmas with nonlinear CGYRO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work characterizes the core transport physics of SPARC early-campaign plasmas using the PORTALS-CGYRO framework. Empirical modeling of SPARC plasmas with L-mode confinement indicates an ample window of breakeven (Q&gt;1) without the need of H-mode operation. Extensive modeling of multi-channel (electron energy, ion energy and electron particle) flux-matched conditions with the nonlinear CGYRO code for turbulent transport coupled to the macroscopic plasma evolution using PORTALS reveal that the maximum fusion performance to be attained will be highly dependent on the near-edge pressure. Stiff core transport conditions are found, particularly when fusion gain approaches unity, and predicted density peaking is found to be in line with empirical databases of particle source-free H-modes. Impurity optimization is identified as a potential avenue to increase fusion performance while enabling core-edge integration. Extensive validation of the quasilinear TGLF model builds confidence in reduced-model predictions. The implications of projecting L-mode performance to high-performance and burning-plasma devices is discussed, together with the importance of predicting edge conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heating Induced Suppression of $d$-band Dominance in the Electronic Excitation Spectrum of Cuprum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of isochoric heating of solids by free electron lasers (FEL) and in situ diagnostics by X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) allows for measurements of material properties at warm dense matter (WDM) conditions relevant for astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and material science. In the case of metals, the FEL beam pumps energy directly into electrons with the lattice structure of ions being nearly unaffected. This leads to a unique transient state that gives rise to a set of interesting physical effects, which can serve as a reliable testing platform for WDM theories. In this work, we present extensive linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) results for the electronic dynamic structure factor of isochorically heated copper with a face-centered cubic lattice. At ambient conditions, the plasmon is heavily damped due to the presence of $d$-band excitations, and its position is independent of the wavenumber. In contrast, the plasmon feature starts to dominate the excitation spectrum and has a Bohm-Gross type plasmon dispersion for temperatures $T \geq 4~{\rm eV}$, where the quasi-free electrons in the interstitial region are in the WDM regime. In addition, we analyze the thermal changes in the $d$-band excitations and outline the possibility to use future XRTS measurements of isochorically heated copper as a controlled testbed for WDM theories.</description>
