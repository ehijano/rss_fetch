      <title>The environmental low-frequency background for macro-calorimeters at the millikelvin scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the most sensitive physics experiments searching for rare events, like neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and dark matter interactions, rely on cryogenic macro-calorimeters operating at the mK-scale. Located underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), in central Italy, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is one of the leading experiments for the search of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, implementing the low-temperature calorimetric technology. We present a novel multi-detector analysis to correlate environmental phenomena with the low-frequency noise of low-temperature calorimeters. Indeed, the correlation of marine and seismic data with data from a pair of CUORE detectors indicates that cryogenic detectors are sensitive not only to intense vibrations generated by earthquakes, but also to the much fainter vibrations induced by marine microseisms in the Mediterranean Sea due to the motion of sea waves. Proving that cryogenic macro-calorimeters are sensitive to such environmental sources of noise opens the possibility of studying their impact on the detectors physics-case sensitivity. Moreover, this study could pave the road for technology developments dedicated to the mitigation of the noise induced by marine microseisms, from which the entire community of cryogenic calorimeters can benefit.</description>

      <title>The LHCb VELO Upgrade Module Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb detector has undergone a major upgrade for LHC Run 3. This Upgrade I detector facilitates operation at higher luminosity and utilises full-detector information at the LHC collision rate, critically including the use of vertex information. A new vertex locator system, the VELO Upgrade, has been constructed. The core element of the new VELO are the double-sided pixelated hybrid silicon detector modules which operate in vacuum close to the LHC beam in a high radiation environment. The construction and quality assurance tests of these modules are described in this paper. The modules incorporate 200 \mum thick, n-on-p silicon sensors bump-bonded to 130 \nm technology ASICs. These are attached with high precision to a silicon microchannel substrate that uses evaporative CO$_2$ cooling. The ASICs are controlled and read out with flexible printed circuits that are glued to the substrate and wire-bonded to the chips. The mechanical support of the module is given by a carbon fibre plate, two carbon fibre rods and an aluminium plate. The sensor attachment was achieved with an average precision of 21 $\mathrm{\mu m}$, more than 99.5\% of all pixels are fully functional, and a thermal figure of merit of 3 \mathrm{Kcm^{2}W^{-1}}$ was achieved. The production of the modules was successfully completed in 2021, with the final assembly and installation completed in time for data taking in 2022.</description>

      <title>ETROC1: The First Full Chain Precision Timing Prototype ASIC for CMS MTD Endcap Timing Layer Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: we present the design and characterization of the first full chain precision timing prototype ASIC, named ETL Readout Chip version 1 (ETROC1) for the CMS MTD endcap timing layer (ETL) upgrade. The ETL utilizes Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors to detect charged particles, with the goal to achieve a time resolution of 40 - 50 ps per hit, and 30 - 40 ps per track with hits from two detector layers. The ETROC1 is composed of a 5 x 5 pixel array and peripheral circuits. The pixel array includes a 4 x 4 active pixel array with an H-tree shaped network delivering clock and charge injection signals. Each active pixel is composed of various components, including a bump pad, a charge injection circuit, a pre-amplifier, a discriminator, a digital-to-analog converter, and a time-to-digital converter. These components play essential roles as the front-end link in processing LGAD signals and measuring timing-related information. The peripheral circuits provide clock signals and readout functionalities. The size of the ETROC1 chip is 7 mm x 9 mm. ETROC1 has been fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, and extensively tested under stimuli of charge injection, infrared laser, and proton beam. The time resolution of bump-bonded ETROC1 + LGAD chipsets reaches 42 - 46 ps per hit in the beam test.</description>

      <title>Microscale Fiber-Integrated Vector Magnetometer with On-Tip Field Biasing using NV Ensembles in Diamond Microcystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum sensing of magnetic fields, ensembles of NV centers in diamond offer high sensitivity, high bandwidth and outstanding spatial resolution while operating in harsh environments. Moreover, the orientation of defect centers along four crystal axes forms an intrinsic coordinate system, enabling vector magnetometry within a single diamond crystal. While most vector magnetometers rely on a known bias magnetic field for full recovery of three-dimensional field information, employing external 3D Helmholtz coils or permanent magnets results in bulky, laboratory-bound setups, impeding miniaturization of the device. Here, a novel approach is presented that utilizes a fiber-integrated microscale coil at the fiber tip to generate a localized uniaxial magnetic field. The same fiber-tip coil is used in parallel for spin control by combining DC and microwave signals in a bias tee. To implement vector magnetometry using a uniaxial bias field, we preselect the orientation of the diamond crystal and then fully characterize it by rotating a static magnetic field in three planes of rotation. We demonstrate the measurement of vector magnetic fields in the full solid angle with a shot-noise limited sensitivity of $19.4\:\textrm{nT/Hz}^{1/2}$ and microscale spatial resolution while achieving a cross section of the fiber sensor head below $1\:\textrm{mm}^2.$</description>

      <title>Robust electrothermal switching of optical phase change materials through computer-aided adaptive pulse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrically tunable optical devices present diverse functionalities for manipulating electromagnetic waves by leveraging elements capable of reversibly switching between different optical states. This adaptability in adjusting their responses to electromagnetic waves after fabrication is crucial for developing more efficient and compact optical systems for a broad range of applications including sensing, imaging, telecommunications, and data storage. Chalcogenide-based phase change materials (PCMs) have shown great promise due to their stable, non-volatile phase transition between amorphous and crystalline states. Nonetheless, optimizing the switching parameters of PCM devices and maintaining their stable operation over thousands of cycles with minimal variation can be challenging. In this paper, we report on the critical role of PCM pattern as well as electrical pulse form in achieving reliable and stable switching, extending the operational lifetime of the device beyond 13,000 switching events. To achieve this, we have developed a computer-aided algorithm that monitors optical changes in the device and adjusts the applied voltage in accordance with the phase transformation process, thereby significantly enhancing the lifetime of these reconfigurable devices. Our findings reveal that patterned PCM structures show significantly higher endurance compared to blanket PCM thin films.</description>

      <title>A beam-driven proton irradiation setup for precision radiation damage tests of silicon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proton irradiation site for silicon detectors has been developed and commissioned at the Bonn Isochronous Cyclotron. The accelerator provides 14 MeV proton beams of up to 1 $\mu$A at beam widths of a few mm to the setup. Devices Under Test (DUTs) are irradiated inside a cooled, thermally-insulated box at $\le$-20{\deg}C, while being moved through the beam in a row-based scan pattern to achieve uniform fluence distributions. Custom-made diagnostics allow for beam-based, on- and offline dosimetry, enabling a beam-driven irradiation routine which produces uniform fluence distributions with standard deviations $ \ll 1 \% $. Dedicated irradiations of thin titanium foils are performed to compare the commonly-used dosimetry via metallic foil activation to the beam-based approach. Within the error margins, both methods are in agreement, whereas the beam-based technique yields lower uncertainties of typically $ \le 2 \% $. Simulations indicate a reduction of the initial proton energy to 12.28(6) MeV on the DUT. Characterization of six, 150 $\mu$m-thin, passive LFoundry sensors before and after irradiation yield a proton hardness factor of $\kappa_\text{p}=3.71(11)$, which is in agreement with expectations, allowing to irradiate up to $10^{16} \text{n}_{eq} / \text{cm}^2$ within a few hours.</description>

      <title>Trees versus Neural Networks for enhancing tau lepton real-time selection in proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces supervised learning techniques for real-time selection (triggering) of hadronically decaying tau leptons in proton-proton colliders. By implementing classic machine learning decision trees and advanced deep learning models, such as Multi-Layer Perceptron or residual neural networks, visible improvements in performance compared to standard threshold tau triggers are observed. We show how such an implementation may lower selection energy thresholds, thus contributing to increasing the sensitivity of searches for new phenomena in proton-proton collisions classified by low-energy tau leptons. Moreover, we analyze when it is better to use neural networks versus decision trees for tau triggers with conclusions relevant to other problems in physics.</description>

Abstract: JSNS$^2$ (J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) is an experiment which searches for sterile neutrinos via the observation of $\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \to \bar{\nu}_{e}$ appearance oscillations using muon decay-at-rest neutrinos. The data taking of JSNS$^2$ have been performed from 2021. In this manuscript, a study of the accidental background is presented. The rate of the accidental background is (9.29$\pm 0.39) \times 10^{-8}$ / spill with 0.75 MW beam power and comparable to the number of searching signals.</description>

      <title>Perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination -- how far is the radiative limit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report an experimental demonstration of perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination and critically analyse their performance against radiative limits. To this end, we first establish a set of quantitative benchmark characteristics expected from solar cells limited by bimolecular recombination. Transient as well as steady state intensity dependent measurements indicate that our solar cells indeed operate at such limits with interface passivation comparable to the champion c-Si technology. Further, we identify novel characterization schemes which enable consistent back extraction of recombination parameters from transient optoelectrical and electroluminescence measurements. Remarkably, these parameters predict important features of dark current density vs. voltage characteristics (J-V) and Suns-V_OC measurements, thus validating the estimates and the methodology. Uniquely, this work provides a consistent and coherent interpretation of diverse experimental trends ranging from dark J-V, Suns-V_OC, steady state and transient intensity dependent measurements to electroluminescence quantum yield. As such, insights shared in this manuscript could have significant implications towards fundamental electronic processes in perovskite solar cells and further efficiency optimization towards Shockley-Queisser limits.</description>

      <title>Long-Distance Signal Propagation in AC-LGAD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the signal propagation in AC-LGAD (aka RSD), which are LGAD with a common N+ layer and segmented AC-coupled readout contacts, by measuring response to IR laser TCT on a large selection of AC-LGAD with strip readout. The interest for this topic derives from the realization that while large charge sharing between neighboring strips is essential for good position resolution, large sharing beyond the next neighbor generates background signals which in general are detrimental to the sensor goal of low occupancy. Using AC-LGAD with strip readout produced by Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK), we evaluate the effects of a variety of sensor properties, including geometrical parameters (strip length, width), process parameters like the N+ layer resistivity, the coupling capacitance, and the thickness of the bulk on the signal sharing and the position resolution.</description>

      <title>Multichannel-GaAsP-photomultiplier-based fiber bundle ISM-STED microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The usage of a GaAsP (gallium arsenide phosphide) photomultiplier for microscopical imaging allows the evaluation of low-light luminescent objects. We designed a setup for collecting a confocal microscopic image signal, which is divided into 14 equal-sized input channels. The division is achieved with a beamsplitter and two fiber bundles consisting of seven fibers each. Re-imaging the confocal pinhole by such a densely packed fiber bundle permits the utilization of a photon re-localization approach to overcome the optical resolution limit. The center fiber creates a real-time image, while the outer fibers enable a higher-resolution image via an image scanning microscope (ISM) signal calculation. The fiber bundles are enclosed in a fused silica capillary and are drawn out to create one solid fiber bundle. During the drawing process, the fiber bundles are tapered down to an outer diameter size of 400 {\mu}m, with each fiber having a less than 0.3 Airy unit diameter. For the photomultiplier interface, all fibers of both fiber bundles are integrated into a v-groove array, with each fiber representing a detection input, which is followed by projection optics for imaging onto the multichannel detector. The resulting confocal super-resolution microscope is suitable for the application of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) techniques such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), time-resolved anisotropy, or F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging.</description>
