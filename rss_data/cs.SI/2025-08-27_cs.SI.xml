      <title>Recognizing Distance-Count Matrices is Difficult</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axiomatization of centrality measures often involves proving that something cannot hold by providing a counterexample (i.e., a graph for which that specific centrality index fails to have a given property). In the context of geometric centralities, building such counterexamples requires constructing a graph with specific distance counts between nodes, as expressed by its distance-count matrix. We prove that deciding whether a matrix is the distance-count matrix of a graph is strongly NP-complete. This negative result implies that a brute-force approach to building this kind of counterexample is out of question, and cleverer approaches are required.</description>

      <title>Digital Skills Formation in Gendered Peer Networks: Exploring advice giving and taking in classrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitalisation of childhood underscores the importance of early digital skill development. To understand how peer relationships shape this process, we draw on unique sociocentric network data from students in classrooms across three countries, focusing on peer-to-peer advice-giving and advice-seeking networks related to digital skills. Using exponential random graph models, we find that digital skills systematically spread through peer interactions: higher-skilled students are more likely to be sought for advice while less likely to seek it themselves. Students perceived as highly skilled are more likely to seek and offer advice, but it has limited influence on being sought out by others. Gender plays a significant role: girls both seek and give more advice, with strong gender homophily shaping these interactions. We suggest that digital skills education should leverage the potential of peer learning within formal education and consider how such approaches can address persistent divides.</description>

      <title>Urn Modeling of Random Graphs Across Granularity Scales: A Framework for Origin-Destination Human Mobility Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model human mobility as a combinatorial allocation process, treating trips as distinguishable balls assigned to location-bins and generating origin-destination (OD) networks. From this analogy, we construct a unified three-scale framework, enumerative, probabilistic, and continuum graphon ensembles, and prove a renormalization theorem showing that, in the large sparse regime, these representations converge to a universal mixed-Poisson law. The framework yields compact formulas for key mobility observables, including destination occupancy, vacancy of unvisited sites, coverage (a stopping-time extension of the coupon collector problem), and overflow beyond finite capacities. Simulations with gravity-like kernels, calibrated on empirical OD data, closely match the asymptotic predictions. By connecting exact combinatorial models with continuum analysis, the results offer a principled toolkit for synthetic network generation, congestion assessment, and the design of sustainable urban mobility policies.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Contrastive Self-Supervised AMR Learning with Masked Graph Autoencoders for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph. By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.</description>

      <title>Affective Polarization across European Parliaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians across all six parliaments.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing graphs and their connectivity using graphlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphlets are small subgraphs rooted at a fixed vertex. The number of occurrences of graphlets aligned to a particular vertex, called graphlet degree sequence, gives a topological description of the surrounding of the analyzed vertex. In this article, we study properties and uniqueness of graphlet degree sequences. The information given by graphlets up to size (n-1) is utilized graphs having certain type of asymmetric vertex-deleted subgraphs. Moreover, we show a reconstruction of trees from their (&lt;= n-1)-graphlet degree sequences, which is much easier compared to the standard reconstruction from vertex-deleted subgraphs.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Precinct and District Voting Data Using Persistent Homology to Identify Gerrymandering in North Carolina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of Feng and Porter's 2019 paper on the use of the level-set method for the construction of a filtered simplicial complex from geospatial election data. Precincts are regarded to be too small to be gerrymandered, allowing us to identify discrepancies between precinct and district level voting data to quantify gerrymandering in the United States. Comparing the persistent homologies of Democratic voting areas on the precinct and district level shows when areas have been 'cracked' or 'packed' for partisan gain. This analysis was done for North Carolina House of Representatives elections (2012 to 2024). North Carolina has been redistricted 4 times in the past 10 years, whereas most states redistrict decennially, allowing us to understand how and when redistricted maps deviate from precinct-level voting data, and when gerrymandering occurs. Comparing persistence barcodes at the precinct and district levels (using the bottleneck distance) shows that precinct-level voting patterns do not significantly fluctuate biannually, while district level patterns do, suggesting that shifts are likely a result of redistricting rather than voter behavior, providing strong evidence of gerrymandering. North Carolina election data was collected from the public domain. Composite shapefiles were created using QGIS and R, and rasterized using Python. The level-set method was employed to generate filtered simplicial complexes. Persistence barcodes were produced using GUDHI and PHAT libraries. Additionally, we compare our results with traditional measures such as Polsby-Popper and Reock scores (gerrymandering identification measures). This research presents a novel application of topological data analysis in evaluating gerrymandering.</description>
