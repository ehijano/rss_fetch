      <title>On Intermediate Exceptional Series</title>

Abstract: The Freudenthal--Tits magic square $\mathfrak{m}(\mathbb{A}_1,\mathbb{A}_2)$ for $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H},\mathbb{O}$ of semi-simple Lie algebras can be extended by including the sextonions $\mathbb{S}$. A series of non-reductive Lie algebras naturally appear in the new row associated with the sextonions, which we will call the \textit{intermediate exceptional series}, with the largest one as the intermediate Lie algebra $E_{7+1/2}$ constructed by Landsberg--Manivel. We study various aspects of the intermediate vertex operator (super)algebras associated with the intermediate exceptional series, including rationality, coset constructions, irreducible modules, (super)characters and modular linear differential equations. For all $\mathfrak{g}_I$ belonging to the intermediate exceptional series, the intermediate VOA $L_1(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ has characters of irreducible modules coinciding with those of the simple rational $C_2$-cofinite $W$-algebra $W_{-h^\vee/6}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ studied by Kawasetsu, with $\mathfrak{g} $ belonging to the Cvitanovi\'c--Deligne exceptional series. We propose some new intermediate VOA $L_k(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ with integer level $k$ and investigate their properties. For example, for the intermediate Lie algebra $D_{6+1/2}$ between $D_6$ and $E_7$ in the subexceptional series and also in Vogel's projective plane, we find that the intermediate VOA $L_2(D_{6+1/2})$ has a simple current extension to a SVOA with four irreducible Neveu--Schwarz modules. We also provide some (super) coset constructions such as $L_2(E_7)/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$ and $L_1(D_{6+1/2})^{\otimes2}\!/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$. In the end, we find that the theta blocks associated with the intermediate exceptional series produce some new holomorphic Jacobi forms of critical weight and lattice index.</description>

      <title>Self-distributive structures in physics</title>

Abstract: It is an important feature of our existing physical theories that observables generate one-parameter groups of transformations. In classical Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum mechanics, this is due to the fact that the observables form a Lie algebra, and it manifests itself in Noether's theorem. In this paper, we introduce \emph{Lie quandles} as the minimal mathematical structure needed to express the idea that observables generate transformations. This is based on the notion of a quandle used primarily in knot theory, whose main defining property is the self-distributivity equation $x \triangleright (y \triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y) \triangleright (x \triangleright z)$. We argue that Lie quandles can be thought of as nonlinear generalizations of Lie algebras. We also observe that taking convex combinations of points in vector spaces, which physically corresponds to mixing states, satisfies the same form of self-distributivity.</description>

      <title>Knot lattice homology and $q$-series invariants for plumbed knot complements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an invariant of negative definite plumbed knot complements unifying knot lattice homology, due to Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz, and Szab\'o, and the BPS $q$-series of Gukov and Manolescu. This invariant is a natural extension of weighted graded roots of negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds introduced earlier by the first two authors and Krushkal. We prove a surgery formula relating our invariant with the weighted graded root of the surgered 3-manifold.</description>

      <title>Wall-Crossing Effects on Quiver BPS Algebras</title>

Abstract: BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The well-known wall-crossing phenomena is that the fixed point spectrum establishes a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space into a collection of stability chambers -- "phases" of the theory. The standard construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases (chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them \emph{glasses} and also divide in a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as the new wall-crossing invariants.</description>

      <title>Equivariant injectivity of crossed products</title>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a $\mathbb{G}$-operator space $(X, \alpha)$, which consists of an action $\alpha: X \curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ of a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ on an operator space $X$, and we make a study of the notion of $\mathbb{G}$-equivariant injectivity for such an operator space. Given a $\mathbb{G}$-operator space $(X, \alpha)$, we define a natural associated crossed product operator space $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}$, which has canonical actions $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G} \curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ (the adjoint action) and $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}\curvearrowleft \check{\mathbb{G}}$ (the dual action) where $\check{\mathbb{G}}$ is the dual quantum group. We then show that if $X$ is a $\mathbb{G}$-operator system, then $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}$ is $\mathbb{G}$-injective if and only if $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}$ is injective and $\mathbb{G}$ is amenable, and that (under a mild assumption) $X\rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{G}$ is $\check{\mathbb{G}}$-injective if and only if $X$ is $\mathbb{G}$-injective. We discuss how these results generalise and unify several recent results from the literature, and give new applications of these results. Among these applications are the following: equivariant injectivity passes to Vaes-closed quantum subgroups and the crossed product functor is compatible with injective envelopes (for compact and discrete quantum groups). We also give dynamical characterisations of inner amenability and amenability of a locally compact quantum group in terms of (inner) amenability or equivariant injectivity of natural associated actions, and we prove that every action of a co-amenable Kac compact quantum group is always amenable.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of C*-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a C$^*$-algebra $A$ with an almost periodic time evolution $\sigma$, we define a new C$^*$-algebra $A_c$, which we call the crystal of $(A,\sigma)$, that represents the zero temperature limit of $(A, \sigma)$. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ground states of $(A,\sigma)$ and the states on $A_c$, justifying the name. In order to investigate further the relation between low temperature equilibrium states on $A$ and traces on $A_c$, we define a Fock module $\mathcal F$ over the crystal and construct a vacuum representation of $A$ on $\mathcal F$. This allows us to show, under relatively mild assumptions, that for sufficiently large inverse temperatures $\beta$ the $\sigma$-KMS$_\beta$-states on $A$ are induced from traces on $A_c$ by means of the Fock module. In the second part, we compare the K-theoretic structures of $A$ and $A_c$. Previous work by various authors suggests that they have (rationally) isomorphic K-groups. We analyze this phenomenon in detail, confirming it under favorable conditions, but showing that, in general, there is apparently no easy way to relate these groups. As examples, we discuss in particular Exel's results on semi-saturated circle actions, and recent results of Miller on the K-theory of inverse semigroup C$^*$-algebras. In relation to the latter, we introduce the notion of a scale $N$ on an inverse semigroup $I$ and define a new inverse semigroup $I_c$, which we call the crystal of $(I,N)$.</description>
