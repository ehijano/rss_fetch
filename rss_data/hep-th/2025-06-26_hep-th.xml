      <title>Correlator Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, "cosmohedra" have been introduced as polytopes underlying the cosmological wavefunction for conformally coupled Tr($\Phi^3$) theory in FRW cosmologies, generalizing associahedra for flat space scattering amplitudes. In this letter we show that correlation functions are also directly captured by a new polytope - the "Correlatron". The combinatorics of correlation functions is an interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions. This is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher dimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets. We provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural extension of the "shaving" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a byproduct, we also define "graph correlahedra" as polytopes for the contribution to correlators from any fixed graph. We show how the canonical form of these polytopes directly computes the graph correlator, without the power of two weights seen in previous geometric formulations. Finally, we give a prescription for extracting the full correlator from the canonical form of the correlatron.</description>

      <title>Categorified structures over moduli spaces: Anomalies, non-invertible symmetries, and exceptional holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we propose an extension of the relation between worldsheet global symmetries and structures over moduli spaces of superconformal field theories (SCFTs) to include noninvertible symmetries. The most familiar examples of such structures associated to an ordinary symmetry are the Bagger-Witten line bundles, which arise over the moduli spaces of two-dimensional N=(2,2) SCFTs from a non-anomalous worldsheet U(1)_R symmetry and its associated spectral flow operators. Generalizing this setting, we consider examples involving anomalous worldsheet symmetries, which, despite not being gaugeable, can still give rise to global structures over moduli space -- as illustrated by the momentum/winding symmetries in toroidal compactifications and higher group gauge symmetry structure in spacetime. Motivated by this analogy, we conjecture the existence of a stack of fusion categories over moduli spaces of G_2 and Spin(7) holonomy manifolds which acts as a noninvertible analogue of the Hodge or Bagger-Witten line bundles over Calabi-Yau moduli spaces. This proposal is based on the observation that SCFTs associated with such exceptional holonomy manifolds contain (tricritical) Ising sectors that play a role analogous to the U(1)_R symmetry in N=2 theories. Although these symmetries are not gaugeable, they behave similarly to anomalous invertible symmetries, providing the conceptual foundation for the proposed moduli space structure.</description>

      <title>Long-lived SEC violation via DM/DE couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a cosmological scenario where an effective violation of the strong energy condition (SEC) is realized through a coupling between SEC-fulfilling dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). Although the SEC-violating solutions might in principle last for an arbitrarily long time, we highlight several challenges that string realizations must face: most notably, the identification of suitable heavy states and their relationship with the theory cutoff. We also discuss negative potentials in the presence of a tower of light states, showing that the DM/DE coupling can push the theory towards regions of parametric control.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian ferromagnets with three-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. An intricate phase structure emerges, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>A Charge Constraint in BMN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I derive a new charge constraint that ties the four angular momenta in a $\frac{1}{16}$-BPS sector of the Berenstein, Maldacena, and Nastase (BMN) supersymmetric $U(N)$ matrix quantum mechanics. The result is related to the charge constraint of the $U(N)$, $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) conformal field theory by identifying three SYM charges with three BMN angular momenta generating $SO(6)$, two equal SYM angular momenta with a BMN angular momentum of $SO(3)$, and scaling $N^2$ by $3$. The BMN charge constraint could be useful to determine whether there exists a dual supersymmetric black hole solution asymptoting to a plane-wave background.</description>

      <title>Charged rotating quantum black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19941v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and holographic properties of charged and rotating quantum black holes in a doubly holographic braneworld setup. These quantum black holes are derived from the anti-de Sitter C-metric and are exact solutions to a semi-classical gravitational theory which incorporates all orders of the backreaction of quantum fields on spacetime. The inclusion of both charge and rotation extends and generalizes previous studies. The thermodynamics and critical behavior of the black holes are examined from the bulk, brane, and boundary perspectives, and we demonstrate that the inclusion of either charge or rotation removes the re-entrant phase transitions seen in the neutral-static case. The critical exponents of the system are calculated using numerical methods and found to differ from the standard mean field theory values for the neutral-static black holes' re-entrant phase transitions, but in agreement with mean-field theory for the phase transitions of the black holes with charge and rotation. Additionally, to test the validity of the semiclassical treatment, we study a mass-gap energy scale $M_{\rm gap}$ to identify regimes where quantum fluctuations of spacetime geometry are expected to become significant and speculate about a connection with weak cosmic censorship gedankenexperiments. We also generalize the quantum Penrose inequality and the quantum reverse isoperimetric inequality to include charge and rotation. Finally, we compute a renormalized gyromagnetic ratio and analyze it in the limit of large backreaction.</description>

      <title>Fermionic S-matrix and cosmological correlators: T-violation at O(H)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Bunch-Davies (BD) and Unruh-de Witt (UdW) de Sitter S-matrices in the presence of spin-$1/2$ fermions. Building on recent work, this enables us to correlate the de Sitter S-matrix with cosmological correlators. We consider a finite-time version of the UdW S-matrix to study $O(H)$ corrections to some typical particle physics processes such as beta decay. Owing to the lack of time-reversal symmetry in the expanding Poincar\'e patch, we find signatures of intrinsic T-violation in polarized beta decay. The observable we study begins at $O(H)$. The possibility of T-violation was examined theoretically in the 1950's by Jackson, Treiman, and Wyld in flat space and has been probed more recently in the emiT experiment, with the purpose of examining fundamental T-violation coming from additional interactions in the Lagrangian. Our analysis places a lower bound on the intrinsic T-violation in the expanding Poincar\'e patch. At $O(H)$, we find both energy conserving and energy non-conserving contributions. Surprisingly, the energy-violating piece, in principle, can give large T-violation at fine-tuned values of the kinematical variables.</description>

      <title>Localization of strings on group manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the partition function of the WZW model with target a compact Lie group $G$ by adapting a method used by Choi and Takhtajan to compute the heat kernel of the group manifold. The basic idea is to compute the partition function of a supersymmetric version of the WZW model using a form of supersymmetric localization and then use the fact that, since the fermions of the supersymmetric WZW model are actually decoupled from the bosons, this also determines the partition function of the purely bosonic WZW model. The result is a formula for the partition function as a sum over contributions from abelian classical solutions. We verify for $G=SU(2)$ that this formula agrees with the result for the same partition function that comes from the Weyl-Kac character formula. We extend the method of supersymmetric localization to certain related models such as the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model and a Wick-rotated version of this model in which the target space is hyperbolic three-space $H_3^+$.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative Heterotic Kerr-Sen Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Solving Infinite Families of Dual Conformal Integrals and Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute infinite families of all-loop planar, dual conformal invariant (DCI) integrals, which contribute to four-point Coulomb-branch amplitudes and correlators in ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, by solving ``boxing" differential equations via package HyperlogProcedures; this amounts to an ``inverse-boxing" operation/integration recursively acting on lower-loop cases (with the box integral as the starting point), and the resulting single-valued harmonic polylogarithmic functions (SVHPL) are nicely labeled by ``binary" strings of $0$ and $1$ without consecutive $1$'s. These functions are special cases of the so-called generalized ladders studied in arXiv:1207.3824, where extended Steinmann relations are imposed due to planarity, and they are counted by the Fibonacci sequence. Our results can be viewed as ``two-dimensional" extensions of the well-known ladder integrals to many more infinite families of DCI integrals: the ladders have strings with a single $1$ followed by all $0$'s, and the other extreme, which nicely evaluate to the ``zigzag" SVHPL functions with alternating $1$'s and $0$'s, are nothing but the four-point DCI integrals from the very special family of anti-prism $f$-graphs. We also study periods of these integrals: while their periods are in general complicated single-valued multiple zeta values (SVMZV), the ``zigzag" DCI integrals from anti-prism gives exactly the famous ``zigzag" periods proportional to $\zeta_{2L{+}1}$, and empirically it provides a numerical lower-bound for $L$-loop periods of any binary string, with the upper-bound given by that of the ladder. Based on $f$-graphs as a tool for studying these periods, we discuss several interesting facts and observations about these (motivic) SVMZV and relations among them to all loops, and enumerate a basis for them up to $L=10$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In holography, flavour probe branes are used to introduce fundamental matter to the AdS/CFT correspondence. At a technical level, the probes are described by extremizing the DBI action and solving the Lagrange-Euler equations of motion. I report on applications of artificial neural networks that allow direct minimization of the regularized DBI action (interpreted as a free energy) without the need to derive and solve the equations of motion. I consider, as examples, magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking and the meson melting phase transition in the D3/D7 holographic set-up. Finally, I provide a framework which allows the simultaneous learning of the embeddings and the relevant aspects of the dual geometry based on field theory data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we perform the boundary algebraic Bethe Ansatz for massive representations of the $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ integrable system. This is a companion analysis to our study of massless representations \cite{Bielli:2024bve}. Our treatment is comprehensive of all possible assortments of tensor-factor polarisations which build the physical representations in the spectrum, and includes different choices of auxiliary spaces, revealing subtle differences in the procedure. We survey both singlet and vector boundaries, obtaining the auxiliary Bethe equations in very general form for all cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-Abelian gauge model with a complex isovector scalar field and a sixth-order self-interaction potential is considered. It is shown that it has a nontopological soliton solution. The features of this soliton include a monopole-like core surrounded by a Q-ball-like shell, the existence of radially excited states, and a long-range dipole chromomagnetic field. The properties of the soliton are studied using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, the asymptotic dependencies of the energy and the Noether charge on a phase frequency are obtained for two extreme regimes. It is also found that in these two extreme regimes, the chromomagnetic dipole moment of the soliton is proportional to its linear size.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear supersymmetry in field and string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis investigates effective field and string theories in which supersymmetry is realized and broken in various ways. Chapter 1 addresses effective theories with nonlinearly realized supersymmetry, constructed using the formalism of constrained superfields. We establish a criterion for identifying inconsistent constraints, formulate their improved versions, and propose, along these lines, improved supergravity models of inflation. In Chapter 2, we discuss a peculiar application of this framework: the gravitational production of massive gravitinos in time-dependent backgrounds. We emphasize some physical subtleties in the standard description of this mechanism, which become particularly severe in the case of the gravitino. Next, the focus shifts to linear supersymmetry, and we investigate the leading-order coupling of the massive spin-2 field supermultiplet to pure supergravity in four dimensions. This analysis is carried out using the supercurrent superfield formalism, and it shows that only a single class of such couplings can be consistently defined. This is fundamentally distinct from the coupling obtained by compactifying higher-dimensional supergravities, and it has interesting connections to string theory and the string lamppost principle. Finally, in Chapter 3, we present a novel orientifold projection of type IIB string theory. This is a Scherk--Schwarz orientifold in which supersymmetry is entirely broken, and the O-planes couple only to the twisted sector of the theory. We argue that this model is invariant under S-duality and can be formulated as an F-theory compactification. We also analyze the D-brane spectrum of the theory and compare the results with earlier similar constructions. All original findings presented in this thesis are preceded by a comprehensive and detailed introduction to the general frameworks to which they belong.</description>

      <title>Confining kinks. $\zeta$-regularized one-loop kink mass shifts in exotic field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining stability analysis of scalar field theories with the Darboux transformation technique, we create models featuring kink-like solutions whose quantum perturbations are all bounded. On the one hand, the stability analysis relates scalar theories with Schr\"odinger equations, whose solutions serve as quantum perturbation modes. On the other hand, the Darboux transformation allows for constructing new exotic but solvable Schr\"odinger equations. This framework relates the quantum harmonic oscillator and its rational deformations to exotic scalar theories featuring non-trivial potentials. Depending on the structure of the spectrum of perturbation frequencies, these potentials may have various local maximums, minimums, and inflection points. The stationary solutions take the form of the definite integral over a finite interval of a function times the Gaussian bell distribution, including the Error and the Owen $T$ functions. Such models do not propagate quantum perturbations around the respective vacuums, so zero-point renormalization does not take place. However, Riemann$-\zeta$ function regularization allows us to achieve finite one-loop quantum corrections to the classical mass.</description>

      <title>Stretched Horizon Dissipation and the Fate of Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the dissipation of infalling particles near black holes under the assumption that the equivalence principle breaks down at the stretched horizon. This violation allows partial reflection of particles just outside the event horizon, as suggested by models such as the fuzzball and firewall proposals. We show that scattering with blue-shifted Hawking radiation leads to moderate dissipation when the particle energy is comparable to the Hawking temperature. The decay rate is independent of the Planck mass, and therefore gravitational wave echoes-arising from such partial reflection-may survive despite the presence of quantum gravitational effects. Our result is universal and does not rely on the detailed microphysics of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Comparison between Causal and Acausal Diffusion: a Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Fick's time-honored theory of diffusion, the system responds instantaneously to external perturbations, resulting in acausal behavior. Maxwell-Cattaneo theory addresses this issue by introducing a relaxation time, rendering the diffusion process causal. We focus on systems where this relaxation time is comparable to the diffusion time and significantly larger than the relaxation times of all other non-conserved operators. In such systems, late-time diffusion is influenced by this relaxation process, leading to a theory of quasi-diffusion. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory (SK-EFT) framework, we compare the theories of diffusion and quasi-diffusion by analyzing the real-time dynamics of correlation functions both in linear response and at one-loop order. In particular, we show that the one-loop corrections in the causal (quasi-diffusion) theory, in both the underdamped and the overdamped cases, are governed by two universal functions. In the overdamped case, the behavior mirrors that of the acausal (diffusion) theory, which has recently been applied for precision tests of SK-EFT in diffusive systems. We suggest that our results in the underdamped limit can also be used for precision tests in quasi-diffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Complete Minimal Form Factors for Irrelevant Deformations of Integrable Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to compute the minimal form factors of diagonal integrable field theories perturbed by generalized $T \bar{T}$ perturbations. Building on existing results by the same authors, these MFFs are constructed in such a way as not to allow for any free parameters, an issue that plagued previous solutions. The MFFs are derived from a generalization of the standard integral representation which has been used since the birth of the form factor bootstrap program. Their asymptotics is characterized by exponential decay at large rapidities. By computing higher particle form factors, we find that any natural higher-particle solutions involve the cancellation of parts of the newly found MFF. We conclude that the assumption that the form factor equations, particularly the kinematic residue equation, remain unchanged in the presence of $T \bar{T}$ perturbations, is too strong. There is a trade-off between having MFFs satisfying desirable analyticity and asymptotic properties and finding analytic solutions to the form factor equations, which is likely solved by nontrivial changes to the form factor equations, especially those where locality or semilocality of fields are essential assumptions.</description>

      <title>Reflection positivity in Euclidean formulations of relativistic quantum mechanics of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the general structure of reflection positive Euclidean covariant distributions that can be used to construct Euclidean representations of relativistic quantum mechanical models of systems of a finite number of degrees of freedom. Because quantum systems of a finite number of degrees of freedom are not local, reflection positivity is not as restrictive as it is in a local field theory. The motivation for the Euclidean approach is that it is straightforward to construct exactly Poincar\'e invariant quantum models of finite number of degrees of freedom systems that satisfy cluster properties and a spectral condition. In addition the quantum mechanical inner product can be computed without requiring an analytic continuation. Whether these distributions can be generated by a dynamical principle remains to be determined, but understanding the general structure of the Euclidean covariant distributions is an important first step.</description>

      <title>The Phases of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel physical picture to understand certain universal properties of the GUE matrix model which are typically ascribed to quantum chaos, i.e. the ramp and the plateau. We argue that these features should instead be associated with a pattern of spontaneous (or weak explicit) symmetry breaking. In this language, the GUE matrix model corresponds to an effective theory that describes the symmetry-broken phase, and where the Hermitian matrix of the GUE should be understood as a massive $\sigma$ field. The physics of this symmetry-broken phase governs certain particular features of the ramp such as its length and shape. However, the simple existence of a ramp is more universal and phase independent; it is related to sum rules obeyed by a large class of matrix models that constrain the interpolation to the plateau regime. Finally, the plateau is controlled by the symmetry-restored phase, which we call confined chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity with positive cosmological constant coupled to matter in an asymptotically de Sitter universe with sphere boundary at timelike infinity. In this setting we show that, to one-loop order and at late time, the norm of the no-boundary state vanishes, going as $ e^{S_0} \frac{Z S_0^{-d(d+1)/4}}{\text{vol}(SO(d,1))}$ with $S_0$ the tree-level entropy of the static patch, $d$ the spacetime dimension, and $Z$ non-negative. While we expect a non-zero norm to arise at two loops, the presence of an observer already stabilizes it to a large, finite value at one loop.</description>

      <title>Radiated Angular Momentum from Spinning Black Hole Scattering Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory approach we derive solutions to the equations of motion for spinning massive bodies up to quadratic order in spins. At leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order these trajectories are obtained in the time domain, and at sub-leading order in the frequency domain. Our approach incorporates diagrammatic techniques and modern Feynman integration technologies, and includes a new family of loop integrals different to those seen in asymptotic PM calculations. Our results provide a new mechanism for computing the radiated angular momentum involved in gravitational scattering, which we reproduce at 2PM order up to linear spins. We have established a framework for computing higher-order effects to further extend the high-precision frontier in analytical gravitational wave physics, and push predictions for the radiated angular momentum to higher perturbative orders.</description>

      <title>Local-in-Time Conservative Binary Dynamics at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the local-in-time conservative dynamics of nonspinning binary systems at fifth Post-Minkowskian (5PM) and first self-force (1SF) orders. This follows from an explicit calculation of the 5PM/1SF nonlocal-in-time tail-type contribution to the deflection angle via worldline effective field theory techniques. Proceeding as in [2403.04853], we subtract the nonlocal tail terms from the result in [2403.07781] and reconstruct a local-in-time Hamiltonian in isotropic gauge -- valid for generic orbits. For completeness, we reinstate the nonlocal terms relevant for elliptic-like motion up to 6PN/1SF in a small-eccentricity expansion. Via the connection between the (source) energy flux in [2210.05541] and tail effects, we also derive the SF-exact logarithmic-dependent part of the full 5PM bound Hamiltonian. Our results provide the most accurate description to date of the dynamics of bound compact objects within the framework of relativistic scattering computations.</description>

      <title>Rank-Preserving Index-Dependent Matrix Transformations: Applications to Clockwork and Deconstruction Theory Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09033v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile framework of index-dependent element-wise matrix transformations, $b_{ij} = a_{ij} / g_f(i,j)$, with direct applications to hierarchy generating mass hierarchies in high-energy physics. This paper establishes the precise mathematical conditions on $g_f(i,j)$ that preserve the rank and nullity of the original matrix. Our study reveals that such transformations provide a powerful method for engineering specific properties of a matrix's null space; by appropriately selecting the function $g_f(i,j)$, one can generate null vectors (or eigenvectors) with diverse and controllable localization patterns. The broad applicability of this technique is discussed, with detailed examples drawn from high-energy physics. We demonstrate how our framework can be used to tailor 0-mode profiles and fermionic mass spectra in clockwork and dimensional deconstruction models, showing that the standard clockwork mechanism arises as a particular case $(g_f(i,j) = f^{(i-j)})$, thereby offering new tools for particle physics BSM model building. This work illustrates the potential of these transformations in model building across various fields where localized modes or specific spectral properties are crucial.</description>

      <title>Understanding thermalization in a non-Abelian gauge theory in terms of its soft modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04397v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ of physical states in a SU(2) gauge theory consisting of soft momentum modes both in and out-of-thermal equilibrium conditions using ab-initio lattice techniques. We have implemented different algorithms to appropriately describe the dynamics of soft-modes for a wide range of temperatures and under non-equilibrium conditions. The non-equilibrium state has been realized starting from an over-occupied initial condition for low momentum soft gluons whereas the thermal state comprises of strongly interacting soft gluons at temperatures where these are well separated from the hard momentum modes. Spectra of positive Lyapunov exponents is observed in both these states, similar to a chaotic dynamical system. From the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate measured in terms of this spectrum, we estimate a typical time-scale of $\sim 0.50(3)$ fm/c to achieve thermalization at $T\sim 600$ MeV starting from the non-thermal state. We also measure, for the first time, the $\lambda_L$ for long wavelength critical modes of SU(2) using the out-of-time-ordered correlator of a classical $Z_2$ scalar field theory, which shares the same universal behavior with SU(2), near the deconfinement phase transition. The $\lambda_L$ is observed to maximize at the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Leading bounds on micro- to picometer fifth forces from neutron star cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equivalence principle and the inverse-square law of gravity could be violated at short distances ($10^{-6}$ to $10^{-12}$ meters) by scalars sporting a coupling $g_N$ to nucleons and mass $\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_\phi\lesssim\rm MeV$. We show for the first time that stringent bounds on the existence of these scalars can be derived from the observed cooling of nearby isolated neutron stars (NSs). Although NSs can only be used to set limits comparable to the classic SN 1987A cooling bound in the case of pseudoscalars such as the QCD axion, the shallow temperature dependence of the scalar emissivity results in a huge enhancement in the effect of $\phi$ on the cooling of cold NSs. As we do not find evidence of exotic energy losses, we can exclude couplings down to $g_N\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-14}$. Our new bound supersedes all existing limits on scalars across six orders of magnitude in $m_\phi$. These conclusions also extend to Higgs-portal models, for which the bound on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle is $\sin\theta\lesssim 6\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

Abstract: Hairy black holes by gravitational decoupling (GD) are probed to derive the gravitational waveform produced by perturbation theory applied to these compact objects. Using the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations governing the metric perturbations and applying a higher-order WKB method, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are computed and discussed. Compared to the QNMs produced in the ringdown phase of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole solutions, it yields a clear physical signature of primary hair imprinting the hairy GD black hole gravitational waveforms.</description>

      <title>Bounds on QCA Lattice Spacing from Data on Lorentz Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that discrete quantum walks, when extended to quantum cellular automata (QCA), can, in the continuum limit, reproduce relativistic wave equations and quantum field theories (QFTs), including free quantum electrodynamics (QED). This QCA/QFT correspondence bridges quantum information processing and high-energy physics, raising fundamental questions about the nature of spacetime: whether it is the continuum QFT or the discrete QCA that is fundamental. For while Lorentz invariance appears robust experimentally, it may only approximate a deeper discrete structure, particularly at Planck-scale energies. This high-energy Lorentz violation is potentially observable either through cumulative effects over cosmic distances or via small deviations at accessible energies. In this paper, we analyze the QCA corresponding to QED and show that it implies both a deviation from the speed of light and spatial anisotropies. Using current experimental and astrophysical constraints, we place upper bounds on the QCA lattice spacing, providing insight into the plausibility of a fundamentally discrete spacetime.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Bulk Current in Quantum Hall Systems with an Expanding Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding topological phases of matter is essential for advancing both the fundamental theory and practical applications of condensed matter physics. Recently, a theoretical framework for a quantum Hall system with an expanding edge state was proposed [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 105}, 105009 (2022)], revealing the existence of an energy flux analogous to Hawking radiation on the edge. Motivated by this work, we extend the analysis to a model of a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime that includes both the bulk and edge regions. Due to the presence of bulk and edges, we demonstrate that the covariant form of the gravitational anomaly appears on the edge via the anomaly-inflow mechanism. Then, we investigate the energy flux on the edge from the viewpoint of gravitational anomalies, such as covariant gravitational and Weyl anomalies. We also find that, due to the conservation of energy and momentum in the entire system, the presence of anomalous currents on the expanding edge induces non-trivial currents in the bulk originating from the expansion of the edge.</description>

      <title>Emergent Lorentzian Geometries from Spin-Foams and Group Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Lorentzian geometries in spin-foams and group field theories is investigated. The spectral dimension of periodic Euclidean spin-foam frusta is studied. At large scales, the spectral dimension is generically four. At lower scales, a non-trivial flow of the spectral dimension is observed, sensitive to quantum effects, curvature induced oscillations and the parameters of the theory. The removal of numerical cutoffs and a thermodynamic limit is discussed, suggesting a phase transition from zero to four large-scale dimensions. Lorentzian Regge calculus for (3+1) cosmology, modelled with Lorentzian 4-frusta, coupled to a massless free scalar field is studied. It is shown that causal regularity, solutions to the Regge equations and a continuum limit only exist if the cells connecting neighboring slices are timelike. The dynamics can be expressed relationally only in the small deficit angle limit. Effective (2+1) spin-foam cosmology with a minimally coupled massive scalar field is investigated. The scalar field mass is shown to ensure convergence of the path integral. The classicality of expectation values is shown to be intimately connected to causal regularity and the path integral measure. A causal completion of the Barrett-Crane group field theory model is developed. Its amplitudes are explicitly computed in spin representation using methods from integral geometry. A Landau-Ginzburg analysis is applied to the complete Barrett-Crane (BC) group field theory model. It is shown that mean-field theory is generically self-consistent, and that timelike faces do not contribute to the critical behavior. Employing the complete BC model, a physical Lorentzian reference frame is coupled, and scalar cosmological perturbations are extracted from entangled GFT coherent states. The dynamics of these perturbations are shown to agree with classical results up to quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Controlling Casimir Effect in Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks have played a pivotal role in physics, mathematics, and biology, propelling the recent revolution in artificial intelligence. This paper studies quantum field theories on networks and proposes a novel junction condition on the node. The junction condition is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions. Finally, we offer brief comments on some open questions.</description>

      <title>Many phases in a hairy box in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I investigate gravitational thermodynamics of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar system in three dimensions without a cosmological constant. In the previous work by Krishnan,Shekhar, and Bala Subramanian (Nucl. Phys. B 958 (2020) 115115 [33]), it was argued that this system has no BH saddles, but has only empty (flat space) saddles and boson star saddles. It was then concluded that the structure of the thermodynamic phase space is much simpler than in the higher dimensional cases. I will show that, in addition to the known boson star and empty saddles, three more types of saddles exist in this system: the BG saddle, its hairy generalization, and a novel configuration called the boson star-PL saddle. As a result, the structure is richer than one might naively expect and is very similar to the higher dimensional ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice simulations of the nonlinear evolution after axion inflation by self-consistently incorporating currents arising from Schwinger pair production. The tachyonically amplified gauge fields trigger the growth of Schwinger currents, leading to universal values for the conductivity and magnetic field at the onset of strong backreaction and subsequent quenching of gauge field production. We show that the Schwinger effect (prematurely) saturates gauge field production, thereby diminishing the prospects of axion inflation magnetogenesis as a viable solution for blazar observations.</description>

      <title>Analytic formulation of Leptogenesis with neutrino oscillation data employing the general parametrization for neutrino mass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed neutrino oscillations and baryon asymmetry, unexplained by the Standard Model (SM), can both be accounted for by extending the SM to include Majorana right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). Tiny neutrino masses naturally arise through the Type-I seesaw mechanism, which involves lepton number violation. Meanwhile, the baryon asymmetry can be generated via leptogenesis, where the out-of-equilibrium decay of RHNs produces a lepton asymmetry that is partially converted into a baryon asymmetry through sphaleron processes. The Dirac Yukawa couplings play the crucial role for both Type-I seesaw and leptogenesis. In this work, we derive an analytic expression for the CP asymmetry parameter in a general parametrization. Focusing on a hierarchical RHN mass spectrum, we evaluate the lowest mass of the lightest RHN that reproduce both neutrino oscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry. We study the case with two and three generations of RHNs for both thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis scenarios. Besides the standard Type-I seesaw involving SM Higgs doublet, we also examine the Type-I seesaw with a new neutrinophillic Higgs doublet. In this case for non-thermal leptogenesis, the minimum value for the lightest RHN mass can be as low as sphaleron decoupling temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a novel hydrodynamic framework for active matter coupled to an environment to study the local temperature of an active nematic, assuming proximity to thermal equilibrium. We show that, due to the mechanosensitivity of fuel consumption, linearized temperature correlations in a homogeneous active nematic steady state remain unaffected by activity. However, we demonstrate that local shearing and twisting cause a confined active nematic undergoing a spontaneous flow transition to develop a distinctive inhomogeneous temperature profile, serving as a thermal signature of activity.</description>

Abstract: We discuss some of the issues that arise when considering the physics of asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, and attempts to address them. Our development begins at the classical level, where several initial value problems are discussed, and ends with several proposals for holography in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. Throughout the paper we give a review of some basic notions such as the geometry of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, the Nariai limit, and quantum field theory in a fixed de Sitter background. We also briefly discuss some semiclassical aspects such as the nucleation of giant black holes and the Hartle-Hawking wavefunctional. We end by giving an overview of some open questions. An emphasis is placed on the differences between a static patch observer confined to live in a thermal cavity and the metaobserver who has access to a finite region of the future boundary.</description>

      <title>Geometrically constrained sine-Gordon field: BPS solitons and their collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an enlarged $(1+1)$-dimensional model with two real scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$ whose scalar potential $V(\phi,\chi)$ has a standard $\chi^4$ sector and a sine-Gordon one for $\phi$. These fields are coupled through a generalizing function $f(\chi)$ that appears in the scalar potential and controls the nontrivial dynamics of $\phi$. We minimize the effective energy via the implementation of the BPS technique. We then obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy and the first-order equations whose solutions saturate that bound. We solve these equations for a nontrivial $f(\chi)$. As the result, BPS kinks with internal structures emerge. They exhibit a two-kink profile. i.e. an effect due to geometrical constrictions. We consider the linear stability of these new configurations. In this sense, we study the existence of internal modes that play an important role during the scattering process. We then investigate the kink-antikink collisions, and present the numerical results for the most interesting cases. We also comment about their most relevant features.</description>

Abstract: We provide a detailed decomposition of Wigner's particles, defined as unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group, in terms of unitary representations of its Lorentz subgroup. As pointed out before us, this decomposition only involves Lorentz representations belonging to the principal continuous series, and further underpins the connection between scattering amplitudes and conformal correlation functions discussed in the context of celestial holography. We provide very explicit formulae for the decomposition of particles of arbitrary mass and (half-)integer spin and for any spacetime dimension. We emphasise that this decomposition is unique and comes with a specific inner product on the corresponding Hilbert space. We also confirm that unitary translations mix Lorentz representations within the principal continuous series only, as required. Implications to the celestial holography program are indicated.</description>

Abstract: We study soliton and black hole solutions with scalar hair in AdS$_3$ in a theory with a Maxwell field and a charged scalar field with double trace boundary conditions, which can trigger the dual boundary theory to become a superconductor. We investigate the phase diagram as a function of the temperature $T$ and of the double trace coupling $\kappa$ and we find a rich pattern of phase transitions, which can be of the Hawking-Page kind or can be due to the condensation of the order parameter. We also find a transition between vortex solutions and the zero temperature limit of the black hole for a critical value of the double trace coupling $\kappa$. The Little-Park periodicity is realized for the dual of the black hole solution with hair as a shift in the winding number and in the gauge field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growth of entanglement entropy in time-dependent states formed due to a global quench in holographic conformal field theories which admit an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet dual gravity description is studied. The global quench in the bulk is modelled by an AdS Vaidya solution with an electric charge. It is observed that the Gauss-Bonnet correction parameter leads to faster thermalization, and lower saturation entropy. The rate of growth also depends crucially on the correction, and may exceed 1 in general spacetime dimensions. Nevertheless, the growth still follows the universal pattern expected for relativistic CFTs. Additionally, a time-dependent analogue of relative entropy introduced in [12] is generalized to include correction from the Gauss-Bonnet parameter. We demonstrate our findings through concrete examples, including instantaneous, linear, and periodically driven quenches. We also briefly mention the evolution of mutual information.</description>

Abstract: By performing a field redefinition via a cohomomorphism on the Maurer-Cartan action of the $A_\infty$ algebra, we construct an action that reproduces the characteristic structure of boundary string field theory (BSFT), which we refer to as the BSFT-like action. We show that the form and several properties of this BSFT-like action closely resemble those of BSFT. Our results suggest that this approach provides a systematic framework to derive the BSFT action from the OSFT based on $A_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.Atiyah and R.Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. We investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch while preserving a connection between the two theories. We also explore an alternative scenario in which the NLSM $O(N)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(N)$ CFT, and instead corresponds to a different universality class. For $N=3$, this could be related to the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, which describes the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in 3D.</description>

      <title>Light and Shadow OPEs: A Carroll Symmetric Approach to Flat Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we fix the leading term in the operator algebra of light-transformed operators in the context of flat space holography. Starting with light-transformed graviton correlators, we show that the OPE obtained by taking the collinear limit satisfies translation symmetry at the leading order not independently but with assistance from the sub-leading order. Motivated by this result, we start with a general CFT-like ansatz for the OPE and, by keeping track of the sub-leading term, derive an expression for the scaling dimension of the operator appearing in the leading term. We further show that we can fix the OPE coefficient corresponding to this term as well. We use this result to find the OPE for well-studied theories like gravity, Yang-Mills and Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, and find that the scaling dimension found from our formula matches with the one obtained by looking at the collinear limit of bulk momentum space vertices. We initiate a similar study for operators in the shadow basis by looking at the OPE of shadow-transformed graviton correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct polarized Calabi--Yau 3-folds with at worst isolated canonical orbifold points in codimension 4 that can be described in terms of the equations of the Segre embedding of $\mathbb P^2 \times \mathbb P^2$ in $\mathbb P^8$. We investigate the existence of other deformation families in their Hilbert scheme by either studying Tom and Jerry degenerations or by comparing their Hilbert series with those of existing low codimension Calabi--Yau 3-folds. Among other interesting results, we find a family of Calabi--Yau 3-fold with five distinct Tom and Jerry deformation families, a phenomenon not seen for $\mathbb Q$-Fano 3-folds. We compute the Hodge numbers of $\mathbb P^2 \times \mathbb P^2 $ Calabi--Yau 3-folds and corresponding manifolds obtained by performing crepant resolutions. We obtain a manifold with a pair of Hodge numbers that does not appear in the famously known list of 30108 distinct Hodge pairs of Kruzer--Skarke, in the list of 7890 distinct Hodge pairs corresponding to complete intersections in the product of projective spaces and in Hodge paris obtained from Calabi--Yau 3-folds having low codimension embeddings in weighted projective spaces.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of fermion level-crossing under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field</title>

Abstract: Gravitational chiral anomaly connects the topological charge of spacetime and the chirality of fermions. It has been known that the chirality is carried by the particles (or the excited states) and also by vacuum. While the gravitational anomaly equation has been applied to cosmology, distinction between these two contributions has been rarely discussed. In the study of gravitational leptogenesis, for example, lepton asymmetry associated with the chiral gravitational waves (GWs) sourced during inflation is evaluated only by integrating the anomaly equation. This approach, however, does not reveal how these two contributions are distributed in this scenario. Meanwhile, the dominance of vacuum contribution is observed in some specific types of Bianchi spacetime with parity-violating gravitational fields. One may wonder whether such a vacuum dominance takes place also in the system with chiral GWs around the flat background, which is more suitable for application to realistic cosmology. In this work, we apply an analogy between U(1) electromagnetism and the weak gravity to the spacetime that captures the characteristics of the one considered in the gravitational leptogenesis. With this approach, we try to obtain intuitive understanding of the fermion chirality generation under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field. By assuming the emergence of Landau level-like dispersion relation in our setup, we observe that spin-2 nature seems to make the level-crossing inefficient, indicating that the chrial charge is likely to accumulate in the vacuum. On this basis, phenomenological implications for gravitational leptogenesis are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Continuous Spin photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Special relativity allows massless particles to have states of different integer (or half-integer) helicities that mix under boosts, much like the spin-states of a massive particle. Such massless particles are known as continuous spin particles (CSPs), a term coined by Wigner, and they are notable for their infinite tower of spin polarizations. The mixing under boosts is controlled by a spin-scale $\rho$ with units of momentum. Normally, we assume $\rho=0$. The interactions of CSPs are known to satisfy certain simple properties, one of which is that the $\rho \rightarrow 0$ limit generically recovers familiar interactions of massless scalars, photons, or gravitons, with all other polarizations decoupling in this limit. Thus, one can ask if the photon of the Standard Model is a CSP at small but non-zero $\rho$. One concern about this possibility -- originally raised by Wigner -- is that the infinite tower of polarizations could pose problems for thermodynamics. To address this question, we study the thermal evolution of a CSP photon gas coupled to isothermal matter, across CSP helicity modes and phase space. We find that the structure of the interactions dictated by Lorentz symmetry imply well behaved thermodynamics. When the CSP photon's interactions to charged matter are turned on, the primary $h=\pm 1$ helicity modes thermalize quickly, while the other modes require increasingly long time-scales to thermalize, set by powers of $T/\rho$. In familiar thermal systems, the CSP photon behaves like the QED photon with small $\rho$- and time- dependent corrections to its effective relativistic degrees of freedom. Sizable departures from familiar thermal behavior arise at energy scales comparable to $\rho$ and could have testable experimental consequences.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling driven by quintessence and the role of GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles has been made. The energy emission rate has also been analysed.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmic neutrino background on black hole superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the effect of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) on superradiant instabilities caused by an ultralight scalar field around spinning black holes (BHs). When the scalar couples to neutrinos via a Yukawa interaction, thermal corrections from the C$\nu$B induce a quartic self-interaction and an effective mass term for the scalar. We show that, for Yukawa couplings as small as $y_{\phi \nu} \sim 10^{-16}$ (for astrophysical BHs) or $10^{-20}$ (for supermassive BHs), the quartic term can quench the instability and set observable bounds, even if the scalar does not constitute dark matter. We assess the robustness of these constraints against several sources of uncertainty, including gravitational focusing of relic neutrinos, galactic clustering, and non-linear backreaction. An enhanced local neutrino density weakens the bounds by up to an order of magnitude compared to a uniform background, yet the induced self-interaction remains strong enough to significantly affect the superradiant dynamics. Our results open a new observational window on neutrino-coupled scalars via BH superradiance.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Metastable Strings in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \times U(1)_\chi$ yields the GUT monopole as well as a comparably heavy $U(1)_\chi$ monopole which also carries $U(1)_Y$ flux. A metastable string scenario in this case requires that the $U(1)_\chi$ symmetry is necessarily broken close to the GUT scale, thus resulting in a dimensionless string tension $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$. We show that the $\chi$ monopole does not carry any unconfined flux following the electroweak symmetry breaking. Coupled with $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$, this metastable string network appears to provide a good fit to the recent Pulsar Timing Array data on the stochastic gravitational background. Gauge coupling unification, especially in the presence of low scale supersymmetry, determines the GUT scale and, in combination with constraints from proton decay experiments, one is able to constrain some of the key parameters in this setup. The breaking of $SO(10)$ via $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ also yields superheavy metastable strings with no unconfined flux associated with the monopoles. Finally, we consider $SO(10)$ breaking via $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$, $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ and flipped $SU(5)$ that yield metastable strings where the associated monopoles carry unconfined flux after the electroweak breaking.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the simplistic scenario where the measurements are assumed to be instantaneous, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

      <title>One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Complexity of Radon transforms and the hybrid functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the reconstruction problem, the universal representation of inverse Radon transforms may imply the needed complexity of the direct Radon transforms which leads to the additional contributions. Meanwhile, in the standard theory of generalized functions, if the origin function which generates the Radon image is a pure-real function, as a rule the complexity of Radon transform becomes in question. In the letter, we demonstrate that the Fourier method together with the hybrid (Wigner-like) function ensure naturally the corresponding complexity. In its turn, this complexity provides not only the additional contribution to the inverse Radon transforms, but also it makes an essential impact on the reconstruction and optimization procedures within the frame of the incorrect problems. The presented method can be effectively used for the practical tasks of reconstruction problems.</description>
