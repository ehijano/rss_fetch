      <title>Dimensional Control of the Coherence Time of Scattered Light in Cold Atom Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atomic clouds are promising platforms for generating correlated photons, but multiple scattering and associated Doppler broadening limit their temporal coherence. Here we demonstrate that cloud geometry provides a powerful means to extend the coherence time of scattered light. In the experiment, intensity-correlation measurements show that an elongated (quasi-1D) cloud exhibits systematically longer coherence times than a spherical (3D) cloud of the same on-axis optical thickness, as a direct consequence of the suppression of multiple scattering in the elongated geometry. Random-walk simulations reproduce this trend and further show that elongation drives the coherence time toward the single-scattering limit. The combined results establish cloud geometry as a robust control parameter for temporal coherence in cold-atom ensembles, with potential applications in quantum optics and communication.</description>

      <title>Nondestructive characterization of laser-cooled atoms using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop machine learning techniques for estimating physical properties of laser-cooled potassium-39 atoms in a magneto-optical trap using only the scattered light -- i.e., fluorescence -- that is intrinsic to the cooling process. In-situ snap-shot images of fluorescing atomic ensembles directly reveal the spatial structure of these millimeter-scale objects but contain no obvious information regarding internal properties such as the temperature. We first assembled and labeled a balanced dataset sampling $8\times10^3$ different experimental parameters that includes examples with: large and dense atomic ensembles, a complete absence of atoms, and everything in between. We describe a range of models trained to predict atom number and temperature solely from fluorescence images. These run the gamut from a poorly performing linear regression model based only on integrated fluorescence to deep neural networks that give number and temperature with fractional uncertainties of $0.1$ and $0.2$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Receiver via Scalable Rydberg Vapor Cell Array with Stark Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms have great potential for microwave (MW) measurements due to their high sensitivity, broad carrier bandwidth, and traceability. However, the narrow instantaneous bandwidth of the MW receiver limits its applications. Improving the instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver is an ongoing challenge. Here, we report on the achievement of an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth MW receiver via a linear array of scalable Rydberg vapor cells with Stark comb, where the Stark comb consists of an MW frequency comb (MFC) and a position-dependent Stark field. In the presence of the Stark field, the resonance MW transition frequency between two Rydberg states is position dependent, so that we can make each MFC line act as a local oscillator (LO) field to resonantly couple one Rydberg cell. Thus, each cell receives part of a broadband MW signal within its instantaneous bandwidth using atomic heterodyne detection, achieving the measurements of the broadband MW signal simultaneously. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the MW receiver with 210~MHz instantaneous bandwidth using an MFC field with 21 lines. Meanwhile, we achieve an overall sensitivity of 326.6~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. In principle, the method allows for achieving an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver, provided we have enough MFC lines with enough power. Our work paves the way to design and develop a scalable MW receiver for applications in radar, communication, and spectrum monitoring.</description>

      <title>Strain-Gradient-Driven Decoupling of Thermal Suppression from Anisotropy in \b{eta}-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain gradients, ubiquitous in flexible devices and epitaxial nanostructures, are a major blind spot for thermal transport in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. We establish that strain gradient unlocks a thermal conductivity (k) suppression mechanism fundamentally more potent than uniform strain: moderate uniaxial gradients (0.6%/nm) suppress k by 32-37% (27-30%) in thin films (nanowires), intensifying to 43.3% with biaxial gradients. This reduction far exceeds that from equivalent uniform strain and surpasses benchmark materials like silicon and BAs. Critically, a surprising decoupling emerges: while 3% uniform strain alters thermal anisotropy by ~25%, strain gradient strongly suppresses k with preserving this ratio. Mechanistically, strain gradients-induced symmetry breaking and enhanced mode coupling anisotropically activate forbidden scattering channels, making gradient-driven scattering dominant over intrinsic phonon scattering below 6.25 THz. These findings redefine non-uniform strain from a parasitic flaw into a powerful design tool for engineering thermal isolation and heat flux in next-generation flexible and high-power \b{eta}-Ga2O3 electronics.</description>

      <title>Electrical Readout of Spin Environments in Diamond for Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are a key platform for quantum sensing and quantum information, combining long coherence times with controllable spin-spin interactions. Most of current quantum algorithms rely on optical access, which limit device integration and applicability in opaque or miniaturized settings. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical approach, photocurrent double electron-electron resonance (PC-DEER), permitting exploiting local dipolar interactions between individual NV spin qubits or ensembles and nearby paramagnetic defects with sub-confocal resolution. PC-DEER extends photocurrent NV readout from single-spin to spin-bath control and coherent manipulation, enabling characterization of bath-induced noise and effective deployment of noise-reduction protocols. We resolve the signatures of substitutional nitrogen (P1) and NVH centers with reproducible contrast by using electrical signals. Our results establish a scalable, optical-free spin readout strategy that bridges fundamental studies of spin environments with deployable quantum technologies, advancing the integration of diamond-based sensors into solid-state quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Chirped magneto-optical trap of molybdenum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have directly loaded a cryogenic beam of molybdenum atoms into a magneto-optical trap. By chirping the detuning of the trapping lasers, we were able to enhance the number of atoms loaded into the trap by more than a factor of two. We optimize the trapped samples for atom number, temperature, and lifetime by varying the laser-cooling parameters. The laser-cooled molybdenum atoms are subsequently transferred to a magnetic trap where we achieve vacuum-limited lifetimes of 100\,ms. Comparison of magneto-optical trap and magnetic trap lifetimes allow us to extract partial decay rates of the $\text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4\rightarrow\text{a}\,^5\text{D}_4$ and $\text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4\rightarrow\text{a}\,^5\text{D}_3$ transitions. We also provide measurements of the isotope shifts for the $\text{a}\,^7\text{S}_3\rightarrow \text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4$ transition with up to four times better precision than previously reported. Finally, we discuss the prospect of applying the chriped magneto-optical trap to produce laser-cooled samples of MgF.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Dynamics of Two Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), the evolution of a quantum system can be restricted to a subspace of its Hilbert space by frequent measurements. A crucial question in QZD of a particle's position is: how short the time interval between successive measurements should be, in order to confine the particle in its initial spatial region? To address this question, we consider a toy model with two ions initially known to be, for simplicity, in a one-dimensional spatial region. By simulating the evolution of this two-body quantum system, we estimate the measurement frequency needed to keep the ions within their initial confined region at a desired confidence level. Two key parameters we employ in our calculations are the Zeno time and the leakage probability of the quantum system. The measurement frequencies are calculated and compared when ions are located initially at different spatial regions. For our simulation, we introduce the Python code {\tt 2IonQZD}.</description>

      <title>Pancharatnam phase as an entanglement witness for quantum gravity in dual Stern-Gerlach interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a central role in the fundamental tests and practical applications of quantum mechanics. Because entanglement is a feature unique to quantum systems, its observations provide evidence of quantumness. Hence, if gravity can generate entanglement between quantum superpositions, this indicates that quantum amplitudes are field sources and that gravity is quantum. I study the dual spin-one-half Stern-Gerlach interferometers and show that the Pancharatnam phase is a tool that qualitatively distinguishes semiclassical from quantum gravity. The semiclassical evolution is equivalent to that of two independent interferometers in an external field. In this case, a phase jump was observed, as expected from the geodesic rule, which dictates the noncyclic evolution in the Bloch sphere. By contrast, in the quantum case, the quantum amplitudes are the sources of the gravitational field, inducing entanglement between the two interferometers, and the phase is continuous.</description>
