      <title>Estimation of tail risk measures in finance: Approaches to extreme value mixture modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis evaluates most of the extreme mixture models and methods that have appended in the literature and implements them in the context of finance and insurance. The paper also reviews and studies extreme value theory, time series, volatility clustering, and risk measurement methods in detail. Comparing the performance of extreme mixture models and methods on different simulated distributions shows that the method based on kernel density estimation does not have an absolute superior or close to the best performance, especially for the estimation of the extreme upper or lower tail of the distribution. Preprocessing time series data using a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model (GARCH) and applying extreme value mixture models on extracted residuals from GARCH can improve the goodness of fit and the estimation of the tail distribution.</description>

      <title>45 Years of Publications in Energy Economics: Evolution and Thematic Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The journal Energy Economics, a leading international peer-reviewed outlet for economic theory in the energy sector, celebrates its 45th anniversary in 2024. This article uses a bibliometric approach to present a retrospective of the journal's contributions. The study includes all publications from the journal based on data from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The resulting sample comprises 6,563 documents covering the period from 1979 to April 2024. The annual publication rate increased by 1.02 percent, with an average of 40.07 citations per document. Institutions from the United States of America and China lead in the number of articles published in the journal. A co-occurrence analysis of keywords was conducted, complemented by a sub-sample analysis, to provide a detailed view of thematic development and evolution over time. Finally, the article highlights future thematic trends of the journal, offering insights for editorial guidelines and interested authors.</description>

      <title>Bandit Profit-maximization for Targeted Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential profit-maximization problem, optimizing for both price and ancillary variables like marketing expenditures. Specifically, we aim to maximize profit over an arbitrary sequence of multiple demand curves, each dependent on a distinct ancillary variable, but sharing the same price. A prototypical example is targeted marketing, where a firm (seller) wishes to sell a product over multiple markets. The firm may invest different marketing expenditures for different markets to optimize customer acquisition, but must maintain the same price across all markets. Moreover, markets may have heterogeneous demand curves, each responding to prices and marketing expenditures differently. The firm's objective is to maximize its gross profit, the total revenue minus marketing costs.
  Our results are near-optimal algorithms for this class of problems in an adversarial bandit setting, where demand curves are arbitrary non-adaptive sequences, and the firm observes only noisy evaluations of chosen points on the demand curves. For $n$ demand curves (markets), we prove a regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(nT^{3/4})$ and a lower bound of $\Omega((nT)^{3/4})$ for monotonic demand curves, and a regret bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(nT^{2/3})$ for demands curves that are monotonic in price and concave in the ancillary variables.</description>
