      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perspectives opened by the development of a low-energy antideuteron beam are here reviewed: precision measurements of the antideuteron properties; formation and spectroscopic analysis of antideuteronic atoms and antideuterium; the pioneering synthesis of heavier anti-elements in particle traps and at low energies. Some practical aspects of generating a low-energy antideuteron beam in the existing AD/ELENA facility are discussed.</description>

      <title>Xiwu: A Basis Flexible and Learnable LLM for High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are undergoing a period of rapid updates and changes, with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model frequently being replaced. When applying LLMs to a specific scientific field, it's challenging to acquire unique domain knowledge while keeping the model itself advanced. To address this challenge, a sophisticated large language model system named as Xiwu has been developed, allowing you switch between the most advanced foundation models and quickly teach the model domain knowledge. In this work, we will report on the best practices for applying LLMs in the field of high-energy physics (HEP), including: a seed fission technology is proposed and some data collection and cleaning tools are developed to quickly obtain domain AI-Ready dataset; a just-in-time learning system is implemented based on the vector store technology; an on-the-fly fine-tuning system has been developed to facilitate rapid training under a specified foundation model. The results show that Xiwu can smoothly switch between foundation models such as LLaMA, Vicuna, ChatGLM and Grok-1. The trained Xiwu model is significantly outperformed the benchmark model on the HEP knowledge question-and-answering and code generation. This strategy significantly enhances the potential for growth of our model's performance, with the hope of surpassing GPT-4 as it evolves with the development of open-source models. This work provides a customized LLM for the field of HEP, while also offering references for applying LLM to other fields, the corresponding codes are available on Github.</description>

      <title>Finite modular symmetries and the strong CP problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that modular symmetry may solve the strong CP problem without axions, by producing a vanishing QCD angle while generating a large quark CP violation phase. We extend this framework to finite modular groups, systematically identifying the allowed mass textures. We find quark fields must furnish 1D representations and scan the minimal model landscape.</description>

      <title>Quantum tops at circular lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum properties of top quark pairs in lepton colliders with unpolarised beams, including spin correlations, entanglement, and violation of Bell inequalities. We present analytical results in the SM and in the SMEFT and discuss several practical aspects, like the choice of quantization axes and $t \bar t$ threshold effects. We also note a correspondence between parity symmetry and entanglement. We find that quantum observables exhibit a rich phenomenology in the SM, and can also provide additional leverage in detecting new physics residing at higher scales.</description>

      <title>Di-Higgs production via Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the pseudo-scalar nature of the axion-like particle (ALP), the CP- conserving production of two Higgs bosons via the ALP necessarily involves an additional Z or $\gamma$ boson. We examine the existing constraints from di-Higgs searches at Run 2 of the LHC and find that, despite the presence of extra objects in the final state, these searches are sensitive to a combination of ALP couplings to gluons and three-bosons in the TeV scale range. Additionally, we propose a specialized search strategy incorporating an energetic leptonic Z boson. This refined ALP-induced production process would allow for the identification of the h h $\rightarrow$ 4 b-jet final state and could potentially probe the TeV scale using data from Run 2 of the LHC. This production process can also occur through a coupling between the top quark and the ALP. We translate the current constraints on di-Higgs production into new limits on the ALP-top coupling.</description>

      <title>Production of $D_{s0}(2590)^+$ in $B$ nonleptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, a new charm-strange meson, $D_{s0}(2590)^+$, has been discovered, it is believed to be the $D_s^+(2^1S_0)$. However, its low mass and wide width are challenged by theoretical results. Given the small branching ratio of the current production channel, resulting in a small number of events and large errors. We suggest to search for the $D_{s0}(2590)^+$ in the $B$ meson nonleptonic decays, $B_q\rightarrow D^{(*)}_qD_{s0}(2590)^+$ ($q=u,d$), followed by $D_{s0}(2590)^+\to D^*K$. We find $Br(B_q\rightarrow D^{(*)}_qD_{s0}(2590)^+)\times Br(D_{s0}(2590)^+\to D^{*}K)=(2.16\sim2.82)\times 10^{-3}$ is very large, and the result is not sensitive to the mass of $D_{s0}(2590)^+$. Due to large branching ratio, large amount of $D_{s0}(2590)^+$ events are expected. This study is based on the framework of instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation, and the used relativistic wave functions for mesons contain different partial waves. The contributions of different partial waves are also studied.</description>

      <title>One-loop contributions to $WWZ$ from new physics in the neutrino sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental confirmation of neutrino mass and mixing disagrees with the picture of the Standard Model, and thus incarnates a good motivation to look for unknown physics. A seesaw variant in which neutrino masses are radiatively generated, with neutrinos characterized by Majorana fields and where a set of three hypothetical neutral heavy leptons are present, has been considered in the present work. We have calculated, estimated, and analyzed the contributions from virtual light and heavy neutrinos to the gauge vertex $WWZ$, in the context of a future electron-positron collider. We have found that contributions to both $CP$-even and $CP$-odd anomalous couplings are generated. Our estimations indicate that contributions as large as $~10^{-3}$ can be achieved in both cases. This is particularly interesting for the $CP$-odd effects, which are expected to appear in the framework of the Standard Model since the three-loop order, thus being quite suppressed. By considering the expected sensitivity of the International Linear Collider to this gauge vertex, we conclude that these new-physics effects would be within its reach for $e^+e^-$ collisions taking place at a center-of-mass energy of $800\,{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>The Higgs Mechanism with Diagrams: a didactic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical treatment of the electroweak Higgs mechanism based solely on Feynman diagrams and S-matrix elements, without recourse to (gauge) symmetry arguments. Throughout, the emphasis is on Feynman rules and the Schwinger-Dyson equations; it is pointed out that particular care is needed in the treatment of tadpole diagrams and their symmetry factors.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions and Their Impact on Precision of the Current Theory Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented precision of experimental measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the increased statistics that will be reached in the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) are pushing the phenomenology community to a new precision frontier, in which new challenges present themselves and new questions arise. A key ingredients of theoretical predictions at hadron colliders are the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the proton. This contribution highlights some of the new developments in the determination of PDFs from a global set of experimental data, from approximate N3LO PDFs and the inclusion of theory uncertainties in PDF fits, to the realisation of the non trivial interplay between parton densities at large-x and possible signals of New Physics in high energy tails of the distributions, which highlights the synergy between high energy and low energy experimental programs.</description>

      <title>Echoes of darkness: Supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter from all galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that the boosted dark matter (BDM) by supernova neutrinos (SN$\nu$) from SN1987a or from the next galactic SN can serve as a novel component to probe nonvanishing interaction between DM and the Standard Model leptons. In this work, we extend this concept and evaluate the present-day diffuse flux of SN$\nu$ BDM originated from all galaxies at higher redshifts. We show that by considering this diffuse BDM (DBDM) component, the best model-independent sensitivity on the product of the DM-$\nu$ and DM-electron cross sections, $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi\nu}\sigma_{\chi e}}\simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{-37})$~cm$^2$ for sub-MeV DM, can be obtained with large-size neutrino experiments such as Super-Kamiokande or Hyper-Kamiokande, surpassing the estimated SN$\nu$ BDM bound from SN1987a. We also examine the impact due to the presence of DM spikes around the supermassive black holes in galaxies on SN$\nu$ BDM and DBDM. Our results suggest that both the DBDM and the SN$\nu$ BDM probes are insensitive to the uncertain properties of DM spikes, unless the next galactic SN happens to occur at a location extremely close to or right behind the galactic center along the SN line of sight.</description>

      <title>QCD bounds on leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD bounds on the leading-order (LO) hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}}$, $a_\mu=\left(g-2\right)_\mu/2$) are determined by imposing H\"older inequalities and related inequality constraints on systems of Finite-Energy QCD sum-rules. This novel methodology is complementary to lattice QCD and data-driven approaches to determining $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}}$. For the light-quark ($u,d,s$) contributions up to five-loop order in perturbation theory in the chiral limit, LO in light-quark mass corrections, next-to-leading order in dimension-four QCD condensates, and to LO in dimension-six QCD condensates, we find that $\left(673.0\pm 40.0\right)\times 10^{-10}\leq a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}} \leq \left(807.5\pm 48.0\right)\times10^{-10}\,$, bridging the range between lattice QCD and data-driven values.</description>

      <title>Polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering at NNLO in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-inclusive hadron production in longitudinally polarized deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering is a powerful tool for resolving the quark flavor decomposition of the proton's spin structure. We present the full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the coefficient functions of polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in analytical form, enabling the use of SIDIS measurements in precision studies of the proton spin structure. The numerical impact of these corrections is illustrated by a comparison with data of polarized single-inclusive hadron spectra from the DESY HERMES and CERN COMPASS experiments.</description>

      <title>Next-to-next-to-leading order event generation for Z-boson production in association with a bottom-quark pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the production of a Z boson decaying to leptons in association with a bottom-quark pair in hadronic collisions. For the first time, we compute predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, and we combine them with the all-orders radiative corrections from a parton-shower simulation (NNLO+PS). Our method represents the first approach to NNLO+PS event generation applicable to processes featuring a colour singlet and a heavy-quark pair in the final state. The novel two-loop corrections are computed for massless bottom quarks, and the leading mass corrections are restored through a small-mass expansion. The calculation is carried out in the four-flavour scheme, and we find that the sizeable NNLO QCD corrections lift the long-standing tension between lower-order predictions in four- and five-flavour schemes. Our predictions are compared to a CMS measurement for Z boson plus b-jet production, achieving an excellent description of the data.</description>

      <title>Transverse Momentum-Dependent Heavy-Quark Fragmentation at Next-to-Leading Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse momentum-dependent fragmentation functions (TMD FFs) of heavy (bottom and charm) quarks, which we recently introduced, are universal building blocks that enter predictions for a large number of observables involving final-state heavy quarks or hadrons. They enable the extension of fixed-order subtraction schemes to quasi-collinear limits, and are of particular interest in their own right as probes of the nonperturbative dynamics of hadronization. In this paper we calculate all TMD FFs involving heavy quarks and the associated TMD matrix element in heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) to next-to-leading order in the strong interaction. Our results confirm the renormalization properties, large-mass, and small-mass consistency relations predicted in our earlier work. We also derive and confirm a prediction for the large-$z$ behavior of the heavy-quark TMD FF by extending, for the first time, the formalism of joint resummation to capture quark mass effects in heavy-quark fragmentation. Our final results in position space agree with those of a recent calculation by another group that used a highly orthogonal organization of singularities in the intermediate momentum-space steps, providing a strong independent cross check. As an immediate application, we present the complete quark mass dependence of the energy-energy correlator (EEC) in the back-to-back limit at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$.</description>

      <title>First Search for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Galaxy Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exact sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory still remain a mystery. For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\%$ c.l.) of the all flavour high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\Gamma=-2$ are $2.57\times 10^{-18}$, $8.51 \times 10^{-19}$ and $2.36 \times 10^{-18}$ $\rm GeV^{-1}\,cm^2\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes. This work shows that these selected galaxy mergers do not contribute significantly to the IceCube detected high energy neutrino flux. We hope that in the near future with more data, the search for neutrinos from galaxy mergers can either discover their neutrino production or impose more stringent constraints on the production mechanism of high-energy neutrinos within galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>See the lightning, hear the thunder: quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the ``thunder'') and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the ``lightning'') BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

Abstract: This introductory work combines bottom-up and top-down approaches towards understanding the underlying categorical structure of possible unifying theories descending from string theory. Guided by well-established developments in the realm of categorical algebraic geometry, we explain why abelianisation could potentially lead to furthering the understanding of how to embed Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in supersymmetric setups.</description>

      <title>Study of isoscalar scalar $bc\bar u\bar d$ tetraquark $T_{bc}$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD study of the elastic $S$-wave $D\bar{B}$ scattering in search of tetraquark candidates with explicitly exotic flavor content $bc\bar u\bar d$ in the isospin $I\!=\!0$ and $J^P=0^+$ channel. We use four lattice QCD ensembles with dynamical $u/d$, $s$, and $c$ quark fields generated by the MILC Collaboration. A non-relativistic QCD Hamiltonian, including improvement coefficients up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_sv^4)$, is utilized for the bottom quarks. For the rest of the valence quarks we employ a relativistic overlap action. Five different valence quark masses are utilized to study the light quark mass dependence of the $D\bar{B}$ scattering amplitude. The finite volume energy spectra are extracted following a variational approach. The elastic $D\bar{B}$ scattering amplitudes are extracted employing L\"{u}scher's prescription. The light quark mass dependence of the continuum extrapolated amplitudes suggests an attractive interaction between the $\bar B$ and $D$ mesons. At the physical pseudoscalar meson mass ($M_{ps}=M_{\pi}$) the $D\bar{B}$ scattering amplitude has a sub-threshold pole corresponding to a binding energy of $-39(^{+4}_{-6})(^{~+8}_{-18}) \mbox{~MeV}$ with respect to the $D\bar{B}$ threshold. The critical $M_{ps}$ at which the $D\bar{B}$ scattering length diverges and the system becomes unbound corresponds to $M^*_{ps}=2.94(15)(5) \mbox{~GeV}$. This result can hold significant experimental relevance in the search for a bound scalar $T_{bc}$ tetraquark, which could well be the next "doubly heavy" bound tetraquark to be discovered with only weak decay modes.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor, Full Momentum Space Neutrino Spin Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of anisotropic neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, the quantum kinetic equations drive coherent oscillations in neutrino helicity, frequently referred to as spin oscillations. These oscillations depend directly on the absolute mass scale and Majorana phase, but are usually too transient to produce important effects. In this paper we present a full momentum-space analysis of Majorana neutrino spin oscillations in a snapshot of a three-dimensional neutron star merger simulation. We find an interesting angular dependence that allows for that resonant and adiabatic oscillations to occur along specific directions in a large volume of the merger remnant. The solid angle spanned by these directions is extremely narrow in general. We then analyze spin transformation in the presence of flavor transformation by characterizing how the effect's resonance and timescale change during a fast flavor instability. For this analysis, we derive a generalized resonance condition that poses a restrictive requirement for resonance to exist in any flavor channel. We determine that spin oscillations at all locations in the merger snapshot have a length scale that is too large for significant oscillations to be expected even where there exist resonant and adiabatic directions.</description>

      <title>The evolution equation for the energy-momentum moments of the non-equilibrium density function &amp; The regularized relativistic third order hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we first derive the evolution equation for the general energy-momentum moment of $\delta f$, where $\delta f$ is the deviation from the local equilibrium phase space density. We then introduce a relativistic extension of regularized hydrodynamics developed in the non-relativistic case by Struchtrup and Torrilhon that combines the method of moments and Chapman-Enskog expansion. Hydrodynamic equations up to the third-order in gradients are then systematially derived within the context of a single species system and the relaxation time approximation. This is followed by a series of linear stability and causality analysis. For the system of massless particles without any charge conservation, the third-order hydrodynamics is shown to be linearly stable and causal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of non-Gaussianity from primordial black holes (PBHs). The formation of PBHs is in general a rare event and the number of PBHs fluctuates following the Poisson distribution function, which is independent from the pre-existing inflationary adiabatic fluctuations. Such fluctuations can dominate over the adiabatic mode on small scales. We focus on the non-Gaussianity of matter density fluctuations induced by the Poisson fluctuation of PBHs and discuss the potentially observable consequences such as the skewness, kurtosis and the scale-dependent bias.</description>

Abstract: In this brief note, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression taking into account the appropriate timescales. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a few hundreds of astronomical units - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, sub-optimal, and general trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating nucleon-nucleon correlations inherent to the strong nuclear force is one of the core goals in nuclear physics research. We showcase the unique opportunities offered by collisions of $^{16}$O nuclei at high-energy facilities to reveal detailed many-body properties of the nuclear ground state. We interface existing knowledge about the geometry of $^{16}$O coming from \textit{ab-initio} calculations of nuclear structure with transport simulations of high-energy $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions. Bulk observables in these processes, such as the elliptic flow or the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, are found to depend significantly on the input nuclear model and to be sensitive to realistic clustering and short-range repulsive correlations, effectively opening a new avenue to probe these features experimentally. This finding demonstrates collisions of oxygen nuclei as a tool to elucidate initial conditions of small collision systems while fostering connections with effective field theories of nuclei rooted in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the theory behind the formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates. We consider the binary formation in the early and late Universe, emphasising the former as it gives the dominant contribution of the present primordial black hole merger rate. The binaries formed in the early Universe are highly eccentric and get easily disrupted by interactions with other primordial black holes. We discuss in detail how the suppression of the merger rate arising from such interactions can be estimated and how such interactions lead to the formation of another, much harder, binary population that contributes to the present merger rate if more than 10% of dark matter consists of primordial black holes with a narrow mass distribution.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic fields in low-energy heavy-ion collisions with baryon stopping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of baryon stopping on the temporal evolution of electromagnetic fields in vacuum at low-energy Au+Au collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 4$-$20$ GeV. Baryon stopping is incorporated into the Monte-Carlo Glauber model by employing a parameterized velocity profile of participant nucleons with non-zero deceleration. The presence of these decelerating participants leads to noticeable changes in the centrality and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ dependence of electromagnetic fields compared to scenarios with vanishing deceleration. The influence of baryon stopping differs for electric and magnetic fields, also exhibiting variations across their components. We observe slight alteration in the approximate linear dependency of field strengths with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ in the presence of deceleration. Additionally, the longitudinal component of the electric field at late times becomes significant in the presence of baryon stopping.</description>

      <title>Towards a spatial cat state of a massive pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experiment for constructing a spatial cat state of a suspended mirror with an order of $\mathcal{O}$(mg). The mirror is set at the center of two mirrors, creating two optical cavities and optical springs. The induced potential exhibits a double-well shape, and its deformation resembles a second-order phase transition as a function of laser power. We estimate an adiabatic condition for the ground state wave function to metamorphose from a localized state at the origin to a spatial cat state within the double-well potential, within a coherence time determined by mechanical and environmental noises. Our estimation suggests that such a construction is possible if we can provide an ultra-high finesse optical cavity with $F = 2.5 \times 10^5$ and a length of $0.3$ cm, along with a shot-noise-limited laser at $7.9$ nW. The necessary mechanical coherence time is approximately one second.</description>

As a proof of concept, we have simultaneously tuned the initial state and final-state interaction models (SF-LFG and hA, respectively), producing a new effective theory that more accurately describes the data.</description>

      <title>A Coordinate-Independent Formalism for Detecting High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an external electric or magnetic field, a gravitational wave (GW) may be converted into electromagnetic radiation. We present a coordinate-invariant framework to describe the GW signal in a detector that is based on this effect, such as cavities for axion searches. In this framework, we pay special attention to the definition of manifestly coordinate-independent expressions for the electromagnetic fields that an external observer would detect. A careful assessment of the detector's perceived motion allows us to treat both its mechanical and its electromagnetic response to the GW consistently. We further introduce well-defined approximations for which this motion may be neglected, and hence provide suggestions on which coordinate frame is suitable to characterise the GW signal in practice. We illustrate our findings in two examples, an infinitesimally thin rod and a spherical electromagnetic cavity.</description>

      <title>Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.668^{+0.180}_{-0.169}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We show that redshift bins of DESI constraints allow $\Omega_m$ to wiggle at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ level with increasing effective redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

Abstract: Taken as a classification paradigm completing the standard model, a new compact form of the SU(2/1) supergroup explains many mysterious properties of the weak interactions: the maximal breaking of parity, the fractional charges of the quarks, the cancellation of the quantum field theory anomalies, and ties together the existence of the right neutrinos and of the heavier Fermions. This compact supergroup is constructed by exponentiating the matrices representing the leptons and the quarks which form a semi-direct sum of Kac modules of the real superalgebra su(2/1,R) such that the overall trace of the $U(1)$ weak-hypercharge $Y$ vanishes. Remarkably, all the elements of this supergroup have Berezinian 1 and determinant 1. In practice, $Tr(Y)=0$ simply means that the electric charge of the hydrogen atom is zero.</description>

Abstract: Modern machine learning is transforming particle physics fast, bullying its way into our numerical tool box. For young researchers it is crucial to stay on top of this development, which means applying cutting-edge methods and tools to the full range of LHC physics problems. These lecture notes lead students with basic knowledge of particle physics and significant enthusiasm for machine learning to relevant applications. They start with an LHC-specific motivation and a non-standard introduction to neural networks and then cover classification, unsupervised classification, generative networks, and inverse problems. Two themes defining much of the discussion are well-defined loss functions and uncertainty-aware networks. As part of the applications, the notes include some aspects of theoretical LHC physics. All examples are chosen from particle physics publications of the last few years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model in which the structure of the quark Yukawa matrices is governed by three spurions breaking the flavour symmetries of the quark Yukawa sector. The model naturally suppresses flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) amplitudes in the down-type sector, but permits sizable FCNC couplings in the up sector. We calculate the branching ratio of $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ to leading and next-to-leading order of QCD for the case with FCNC couplings of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons to up-type quarks and verify that all counterterms follow the pattern dictated by the spurion expansion of the Yukawa matrices. We find correlations between $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, $b\to s\gamma$, and the Higgs masses. The $B_s - \bar B_s$ mixing amplitude is naturally suppressed in the model but can probe a portion of the parameter space with very heavy Higgs bosons.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of extended multiHiggs doublet models with $S_4$ family symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose extended 3HDM and 4HDM models where the SM gauge symmetry is enlarged by the spontaneously broken $S_4$ group, the preserved $Z_2$ and broken $Z_4$ cyclic symmetries. Each model has three active $SU(2)$ scalar doublets, in addition, the first one has an extra inert scalar singlet, whereas the second model has an inert scalar doublet. Furthermore, each model has several extra gauge singlet scalars, which are triplets under $S_4$. Both models yield the same structure of the mass matrices for the fermion sector, where a radiative seesaw generates the tiny light active neutrinos masses at one-loop level, through the $S_4$ triplets. The presence of flavor changing neutral currents mediated by heavy scalars allowed us to study the $(K^0-\overline{K}^0)$ and $(B_{d,s}^0-\overline{B}_{d,s}^0)$ meson mixings, in the parameter space that currently satisfies the experimental constraints. On the other hand, due to the preserved $Z_2$ symmetry, our proposed models have stable scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates. Furthermore, these models are consistent with the current pattern of SM fermion masses and mixings, with the measured dark matter relic abundance and successfully accommodate the constraints arising from meson oscillations and oblique parameters. The extra scalars in our models provide radiative corrections to the oblique parameters, where due to the presence of the scalar inert doublet, renders the 4HDM less restrictive than the 3HDM one.</description>

      <title>Determination of the $W$-boson mass at hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an observable relevant for the determination of the $W$-boson mass $m_W$ at hadron colliders. This observable is defined as an asymmetry around the jacobian peak of the charged-lepton transverse-momentum distribution in the charged-current Drell-Yan process. We discuss the observable's theoretical prediction, presenting results at different orders in QCD, and showing its perturbative stability. Its definition as a single scalar number and its linear sensitivity to $m_W$ allow a clean extraction of the latter and a straightforward discussion of the associated theoretical systematics: a perturbative QCD uncertainty of ${\cal O}(\pm 5)$ MeV on $m_W$ can be established by means of this observable, relying solely on charged-current Drell-Yan information. Owing to its relatively inclusive nature, the observable displays desirable properties also from the experimental viewpoint, especially for the unfolding of detector effects. We show that a measurement of this observable can lead to a competitive experimental error on $m_W$ at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Renormalisable Non-local Quark-Gluon Interaction: Mass Gap, Chiral Symmetry Breaking &amp; Scale Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10944v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model from a non-local gauge theory and show that it has confining properties at low energies. In particular, we present an extended approach to non-local QCD and a complete revision of the technique of Bender, Milton and Savage applied to non-local theories, providing a set of Dyson--Schwinger equations in differential form. In the local case, we obtain closed form solutions in the simplest case of the scalar field and extend it to the Yang--Mills field. In general, for non-local theories, we use a perturbative technique and a Fourier series and show how higher-order harmonics are heavily damped due to the presence of the non-local factor. The spectrum of the theory is analysed for the non-local Yang--Mills sector and found to be in agreement with the local results on the lattice in the limit of the non-locality mass parameter running to infinity. In the non-local case, we confine ourselves to a non-locality mass that is sufficiently large compared to the mass scale arising from the integration of the Dyson--Schwinger equations. Such a choice results in good agreement, in the proper limit, with the spectrum of the local theory. We derive the gap equation for the fermions in the theory that gives some indication of quark confinement in the non-local NJL case as well. Confinement seems to be a rather ubiquitous effect that removes some degrees of freedom in the original action, favouring the appearance of new observable states, as seen, e.g.,\ for quantum chromodynamics at lower energies.</description>

      <title>The global $B-L$ symmetry in the flavor-unified ${\rm SU}(N)$ theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the origin of the global $B-L$ symmetry in a class of flavor-unified theories with gauge groups of ${\rm SU}(N\geq 6)$. In particular, we focus on the ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory which can minimally embed three-generational SM fermions non-trivially. A reformulation of the third law for the flavor sector proposed by Georgi is useful to manifest the underlying global symmetries. The 't Hooft anomaly matching and the generalized neutrality conditions for Higgs fields play the key roles in defining the $B-L$ symmetry. Based on the global $B-L$ symmetry, we count the Higgs fields that can develop the VEVs and the massless sterile neutrinos in the ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory. We also prove that a global $B-L$ symmetry can always be defined in any ${\rm SU}(N\geq 6)$ theory when it is spontaneously broken to the SM gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Study of Scalar Non Standard Interaction at Protvino to Super-ORCA experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the phenomenon of non-standard interaction mediated by a scalar field (SNSI) in the context of P2SO experiment and compared its sensitivity with DUNE. In particular, we have studied the capability of these two experiments to put bounds on the diagonal SNSI parameters i.e., $\eta_{ee}$, $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ and studied the impact of these parameters on the determination of neutrino mass ordering, octant of $\theta_{23}$ and CP violation (CPV). In our analysis we find that, the parameter $\Delta m^2_{31}$ has a non-trivial role if one wants estimate the bounds on $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ assuming SNSI does not exist in nature. Our results show that sensitivity of P2SO and DUNE to constraint $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ are similar whereas the sensitivity of DUNE is slightly better for $\eta_{ee}$. We find that the mass ordering and CPV sensitivities are mostly affected by $\eta_{ee}$ compared to $\eta_{\mu \mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau \tau}$ if one assumes SNSI exists in nature. On the other hand, octant sensitivity is mostly affected by $\eta_{\mu \mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau \tau}$. These sensitivities can be either higher or lower than the standard three flavour scenario depending on the relative sign of the SNSI parameters. Regarding the precision of atmospheric mixing parameters, we find that the precision of $\theta_{23}$ deteriorates significantly in the presence of $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$.</description>

      <title>On the Galactic radio signal from stimulated decay of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the full-sky distribution of the radio emission from the stimulated decay of axions which are assumed to compose the dark matter in the Galaxy. Besides the constant extragalactic and CMB components, the decays are stimulated by a Galactic radio emission with a spatial distribution that we empirically determine from observations. We compare the diffuse emission to the counterimages of the brightest supernovae remnants, and take into account the effects of free-free absorption. We show that, if the dark matter halo is described by a cuspy NFW profile, the expected signal from the Galactic center is the strongest. Interestingly, the emission from the Galactic anti-center provides competitive constraints that do not depend on assumptions on the uncertain dark matter density in the inner region. Furthermore, the anti-center of the Galaxy is the brightest spot if the Galactic dark matter density follows a cored profile. The expected signal from stimulated decays of axions of mass $m _{a} \sim 10 ^{-6}$ eV is within reach of the Square Kilometer Array for an axion-photon coupling $g _{a\gamma} \gtrsim (2-3) \times 10 ^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violation by two units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged lepton flavor violation arises in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory at mass dimension six. The operators that induce neutrinoless muon and tauon decays are among the best constrained and are sensitive to new-physics scales up to $10^7\,$GeV. An entirely different class of lepton-flavor-violating operators violates lepton flavors by two units rather than one and does not lead to such clean signatures. Even the well-known case of muonium--anti-muonium conversion that falls into this category is only sensitive to two out of the three $\Delta L_\mu = - \Delta L_e = 2$ dimension-six operators. We derive constraints on many of these operators from lepton flavor universality and show how to make further progress with future searches at Belle II and future experiments such as $Z$ factories or muon colliders.</description>

      <title>Relevance of one-loop SMEFT matching in the 2HDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) is a well understood alternative to the Standard Model of particle physics. If the new particles included in the 2HDM are at an energy scale much greater than the weak scale, the theory can be matched to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We compute for the first time the complete one-loop matching at dimension-6. We compare its numerical impact with that of tree-level matching at dimension-8 by performing a global fit to single Higgs and precision electroweak measurements, and we emphasize the importance of comparing one-loop SMEFT results with corresponding one-loop results in the full 2HDM model. In the SMEFT, we consider the relative importance of both one-loop matching and the inclusion of renormalization group evolution. Our results demonstrate the necessity of studying the impact of various expansions to quantify the uncertainties of the SMEFT matching.</description>

      <title>Investigations of $\Lambda$ states with spin-parity $\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study provides spectroscopic investigations of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ $\Lambda$ baryons with both positive and negative parities. The analysis mainly focuses on three states, namely $1P$, $2P$, and $2S$, and corresponding masses are calculated using the QCD sum rule method. To implement the method, we apply two types of interpolating currents with octet and singlet quantum numbers and compare the corresponding results with the reported masses of experimentally observed states. From the comparisons, it is extracted that the results of interpolating current with octet quantum numbers are in good agreement with the experimentally measured masses. The masses obtained with this interpolating current are $m=1513.64\pm 8.76$ MeV for $1P$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$, $m'=1687.91\pm 0.31$ MeV for $2P$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ and $\tilde{m}=1882.37 \pm 11.95$ MeV for $2S$ state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ and they are consistent with the experimental masses of $\Lambda(1520)$, $\Lambda(1690)$ and $\Lambda(1890)$, respectively, which confirm their spin-parity quantum numbers. Besides, we calculate the corresponding current coupling constants, which are utilized as inputs in the calculations of different form factors defining the widths of the states under study.</description>

Abstract: The production of doubly strange hyperon $\Xi^-$ and trebly strange hyperon $\Omega^-$ in relativistic Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 4.2 GeV is explored based on a relativistic transport model that is interweaved with hadronic mean-field potentials for heavy-ion collisions. Upon comparison, it appears that relative to the double strangeness observable $\Xi^-$, the yield and collective flows of the triple strange $\Omega^-$ exhibit a higher sensitivity to the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. This characteristic makes the $\Omega^-$ an essential observable for studying the properties of densely formed matter in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\phi$CDM models provide an alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, while being physically better motivated. These models lead to a time-dependent speed of sound for dark energy that is difficult to replicate by $w$CDM parametrizations. We review the most up-to-date status of observational evidence for the $\phi$CDM models in this paper. We start with an overview of the motivation behind these classes of models, the basic mathematical formalism, and the different classes of models. We then present a compilation of recent results of applying different observational probes to constraining $\phi$CDM model parameters. Over the last twenty years, the precision of observational data has increased immensely, leading to ever tighter constraints. A combination of the recent measurements favors the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model, but a large class of $\phi$CDM models is still not ruled out.</description>

      <title>The Dark Dimension, the Swampland, and the Dark Matter Fraction Composed of Primordial Near-Extremal Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent publication we studied the decay rate of primordial black holes perceiving the dark dimension, an innovative five-dimensional (5D) scenario that has a compact space with characteristic length-scale in the micron range. We demonstrated that the rate of Hawking radiation of 5D black holes slows down compared to 4D black holes of the same mass. Armed with our findings we showed that for a species scale of ${\cal O} (10^{9}~{\rm GeV})$, an all-dark-matter interpretation in terms of primordial black holes should be feasible for black hole masses in the range $10^{14} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$. As a natural outgrowth of our recent study, herein we calculate the Hawking evaporation of near-extremal 5D black holes. Using generic entropy arguments we demonstrate that Hawking evaporation of higher-dimensional near-extremal black holes proceeds at a slower rate than the corresponding Schwarzschild black holes of the same mass. Assisted by this result we show that if there were 5D primordial near-extremal black holes in nature, then a PBH all-dark-matter interpretation would be possible in the mass range $10^{7}\sqrt{\beta} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$, where $\beta$ is a parameter that controls the difference between mass and charge of the associated near-extremal black hole.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain five popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$ indicating a beyond $2\sigma$ evidence of primordial gravitational waves. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrink the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy implying that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe, and give a clue of massive sterile neutrinos via the $2\sigma$ constraint on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}=3.16^{+0.26}_{-0.11}$ and the effective mass $m^{eff}_{\nu, sterile}&lt;0.52$ eV. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter, dark energy and neutrinos, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Search for a light muon-philic $Z'$ with the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of an additional U(1) gauge $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ symmetry would release the tension between the measured and the predicted value of the anomalous muon magnetic moment: this paradigm assumes the existence of a new, light $Z'$ vector boson, with dominant coupling to ${\mu}$ and ${\tau}$ and interacting with electrons via a loop mechanism. The $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ model can also explain the Dark Matter relic abundance, by assuming that the $Z'$ boson acts as a "portal" to a new Dark Sector of particles in Nature, not charged under known interactions. In this work we present the results of the $Z'$ search performed by the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN SPS, that collected $ \sim 9 \times 10^{11}$ 100-GeV electrons impinging on an active thick target. Despite the suppressed $Z'$ production yield with an electron beam, the limits sets by NA64-$e$ are competitive with other experimental searches, and partially exclude the $g-2$ preferred model parameter values for $Z'$ masses lighter than 2 MeV. This result proves the complementarity of this search with NA64-${\mu}$, the parallel effort of the NA64 collaboration with a muon beam.</description>
