      <title>Spectral flow and Robin domains on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Robin count, a generalization of the nodal and Neumann counts of eigenfunctions. This counts the number of points where the quantity f'/f takes a prescribed value, known as the Robin parameter, delta coupling, or cotangent of the Pr\"ufer angle. Correspondingly, we introduce the Robin map (a generalization of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map) and prove an index theorem which relates the Morse index of the Robin map with the Robin count deficiency. In this context, we present some basic properties of the spectral flow for families of Schr\"odinger operators on metric graphs. It is shown that the spectral flow may be used to express topological information of the graph and its operator - the graph's first Betti number, the number of interaction vertices, and their positions with respect to the graph cycles.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of orbits of matrix pencils under strict equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, given two matrix pencils $L$ and $M$, if $M$ belongs to the closure of the orbit of $L$ under strict equivalence, then the dimension of the orbit of $M$ is smaller than or equal to the dimension of the orbit of $L$, and the equality is only attained when $M$ belongs to the orbit of $L$. Our proof uses only the majorization involving the eigenstructures of $L$ and $M$ which characterizes the inclusion relationship between orbit closures, together with the formula for the codimension of the orbit of a pencil in terms of its eigenstruture.</description>

      <title>Quantum ergodicity for Dirichlet-truncated operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove quantum ergodicity (a form of delocalization for eigenfunctions) for the Dirichlet truncations of the adjacency matrix on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We also extend the result to the cases of finite range observables and periodic Schr\"odinger operators with periods of length at most two. This work partially answers a question asked by McKenzie and Sabri (Comm. Math. Phys. 403(3), 1477--1509(2023)).</description>

      <title>Convergence of Schr\"odinger operators on domains with scaled resonant potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators on a bounded, smooth domain of dimension $d \ge 2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions and a properly scaled potential, which depends only on the distance to the boundary of the domain. Our aim is to analyse the convergence of these operators as the scaling parameter tends to zero. If the scaled potential is resonant, the limit in strong resolvent sense is a Robin Laplacian with boundary coefficient expressed in terms of the mean curvature of the boundary. A counterexample shows that norm resolvent convergence cannot hold in general in this setting. If the scaled potential is non-negative (hence non-resonant), the limit in strong resolvent sense is the Dirichlet Laplacian. We conjecture that we can drop the non-negativity assumption in the non-resonant case.</description>

      <title>The $H^\infty$-functional calculus for right slice hyperholomorphic functions and right linear Clifford operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, the spectral theory on the $S$-spectrum was used to establish the $H^\infty$-functional calculus for quaternionic or Clifford operators. This calculus applies for example to sectorial or bisectorial right linear operators $T$ and left slice hyperholomorphic functions $f$ that can grow as polynomials. It relies on the product of the two operators $e(T)^{-1}$ and $(ef)(T)$, both defined via some underlying $S$-functional calculus (also called $\omega$-functional calculus). For left slice holomorphic functions $f$ this definition does not depend on the choice of the regularizer function $e$. However, due to the non-commutative multiplication of Clifford numbers, it was unclear how to extend this definition to right slice hyperholomorphic functions. This paper addresses this significant unresolved issue and shows how right linear operators can possess the $H^\infty$-functional calculus also for right slice hyperholomorphic functions.</description>

      <title>Outlier-free isogeometric discretizations for Laplace eigenvalue problems: closed-form eigenvalue and eigenvector expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrices resulting from isogeometric Galerkin discretizations based on outlier-free spline subspaces for the Laplace operator, under different types of homogeneous boundary conditions on bounded intervals. For optimal spline subspaces and specific reduced spline spaces, represented in terms of B-spline-like bases, we show that the corresponding mass and stiffness matrices exhibit a Toeplitz-minus-Hankel or Toeplitz-plus-Hankel structure. Such matrix structure holds for any degree p and implies that the eigenvalues are an explicitly known sampling of the spectral symbol of the Toeplitz part. Moreover, by employing tensor-product arguments, we extend the closed-form property of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to a d-dimensional box. As a side result, we have an algebraic confirmation that the considered optimal and reduced spline spaces are indeed outlier-free.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Convolution: Infinitesimal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive and multiplicative finite free convolutions are operations on the set of polynomials with real roots, whose empirical distributions are known to approximate free additive and multiplicative convolutions, as the degree $d$ converges to infinity. In this paper, we study these approximations in finer detail, focusing on corrections (or fluctuations) up to order $1/d$, namely their infinitesimal distribution. By studying how the infinitesimal behavior of the moments relates to the infinitesimal behavior of the cumulants we are able to determine how the infinitesimal distributions changes under the additive and multiplicative finite free convolutions. It is worth mentioning that these operations do not correspond to the infinitesimal free additive and multiplicative convolutions that has been studied before, but in the additive case we provide an explicit connection using subordination functions. We give several examples and applications, including an explicit formula to compute the effect of repeated differentiation on the infinitesimal distribution.</description>

      <title>Wannier decay and the Thouless conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial Chern classes pose an obstruction to the existence of exponentially decaying Wannier functions which provide natural bases for spectral subspaces. For non-trivial Bloch bundles, we obtain decay rates of Wannier functions in dimensions $d=2,3$. For $d=2$, we construct Wannier functions with full asymptotics and optimal decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$ as conjectured by Thouless; for $d=3$, we construct Wannier functions with the uniform decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the first and second Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian in annular domains. More precisely, we consider $\Omega_r = \Omega_0 \setminus \overline{B}_r$, where $\Omega_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$, is an open, bounded set with a Lipschitz boundary, and $B_r$ is the ball centered at the origin with radius $r &gt; 0$, such that $\overline{B}_r \subset \Omega_0$. In the first part of the paper, we focus on the first Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue $\sigma_1(\Omega_r)$ and prove that the sequence of corresponding normalized eigenfunctions converges to a particular constant as $r \to 0^+$. This will allow us to prove an isoperimetric inequality for $ \sigma_1(\Omega_r)$ when $r$ is small enough, under a measure constraint. The second part is focused on the second Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue $\sigma_2(\Omega_r)$. We prove that it converges to the first non-trivial Steklov eigenvalue $\overline{\sigma}_1(\Omega_0)$ of the non-perforated domain $\Omega_0$. This result, together with the Brock and Weinstock inequalities, respectively, allows us to prove two isoperimetric inequalities for small holes.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Analysis of Power Graph of Dihedral Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power graph \( \mathcal{G}_G \) of a group \( G \) is a graph whose vertex set is \( G \), and two elements \( x, y \in G \) are adjacent if one is an integral power of the other. In this paper, we determine the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian spectra of the power graph of the dihedral group \( D_{2pq} \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are distinct primes. Our findings demonstrate that the results of Romdhini et al. [2024], published in the \textit{European Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics}, do not hold universally for all \( n \geq 3 \). Our analysis demonstrates that their results hold true exclusively when \( n = p^m \) where \( p \) is a prime number and \( m \) is a positive integer. The research examines their methodology via explicit counterexamples to expose its boundaries and establish corrected results. This study improves past research by expanding the spectrum evaluation of power graphs linked to dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between pure and applied research on scalar, linear Volterra equations by examining five major classes: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone kernels (viscoelastic models); equations with positive definite kernels (partially observed quantum systems); difference equations with discrete, positive definite kernels; a generalized class of delay differential equations; and a generalized class of fractional differential equations. We develop a general, spectral theory that provides a system of correspondences between these disparate domains. As a result, we see how `interconversion' (operator inversion) arises as a natural, continuous involution within each class, yielding a plethora of novel formulas for analytical solutions of such equations. This spectral theory unifies and extends existing results in viscoelasticity, signal processing, and analysis. It also introduces a geometric construction of the regularized Hilbert transform, revealing a fundamental connection to fractional and delay differential equations. Finally, it offers a practical toolbox for Volterra equations of all classes, reducing many to pen-and-paper calculations and introducing a powerful spectral approach for general Volterra equations based on rational approximation.</description>
