      <title>Hermitian-Poisson metrics on projectively flat complex vector bundles over non-compact Gauduchon manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the projectively flat bundles over a class of non-compact Gauduchon manifolds. By combining heat flow techniques and continuity methods, we establish a correspondence between the existence of Hermitian-Poisson metrics and the semi-simplicity property on projectively flat bundles.</description>

      <title>Short geodesics and multiplicities of eigenvalues of hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain upper bounds on the multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues for closed hyperbolic surfaces in terms of the number of short closed geodesics and the genus $g$. For example, we show that if the number of short closed geodesics is sublinear in $g$, then the multiplicity of the first eigenvalue is also sublinear in $g$. This makes new progress on a conjecture by Colin de Verdi\`ere in the mid 1980s.</description>

      <title>A topological rigidity theorem on noncompact Hessian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain a short time solution for a geometric flow on noncompact affine Riemannian manifolds. Using this result, we can construct a Hessian metric with nonnegative bounded Hessian sectional curvature on some Hessian manifolds with nonnegative Hessian sectional curvature. Our results can be regarded as a real version of Lee-Tam \cite{LT20}. As an application, we prove that a complete noncompact Hessian manifold with nonnegative Hessian sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ if its tangent bundle has maximal volume growth. This is an improvement of Theorem 1.3 in Jiao-Yin \cite{JY25}.</description>

      <title>Geodesic orbit metrics on the compact Lie group $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geodesics on Riemannian manifolds are precisely the locally length-minimizing curves, but their explicit description via simple functions is rarely possible. Geodesics of the simplest form, such as lines on Euclidean space and great circles on the round sphere, usually arise as orbits of one-parameter groups of isometries via Lie group actions. Manifolds where all geodesics are such orbits are called geodesic orbit manifolds (or g.o. manifolds), and their understanding and classification spans a quite long and continuous history in Riemannian geometry. In this paper, we classify the left-invariant g.o. metrics on the compact Lie group $G_2$, using the nice representation theoretic behaviour of a class of Lie subgroups called (weakly) regular. We expect that the main tools and insights discussed here will facilitate further classifications of g.o. Lie groups, particularly of lower ranks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a class of $C^k$-regular surfaces, $k \geq 1$, \emph{tileable surfaces}, that admit geometric tilings by a finite number of congruence classes of tiles. We show how to construct many examples, and examine the relationship with the well known tilings of the plane and sphere, as well as monohedral polyhedral surfaces.</description>

      <title>Universality in computable dynamical systems: Old and new</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between computational models and dynamics has captivated mathematicians and computer scientists since the earliest conceptualizations of computation. Recently, this connection has gained renewed attention, fueled by T. Tao's programme aiming to discover blowing-up solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations using an embedded computational model. In this survey paper, we review some of the recent works that introduce novel and exciting perspectives on the representation of computability through dynamical systems. Starting from dynamical universality in a classical sense, we shall explore the modern notions of Turing universality in fluid dynamics and Topological Kleene Field Theories as a systematic way of representing computable functions by means of dynamical bordisms. Finally, we will discuss some important open problems in the area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the differential smoothness of various five-dimensional Artin-Schelter regular algebras. By analyzing the relationship between the number of generators and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, we provide structural obstructions to differential smoothness in specific algebraic families. In particular, we prove that certain two- and four-generator AS-regular algebras of global dimension five fail to admit a differential calculus, while a five-generator graded Clifford algebra provides a contrasting positive example.</description>

      <title>Closed Form Time Derivatives of the Equations of Motion of Rigid Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots, and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.</description>

      <title>Tree inference with varifold distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a tree inference problem motivated by the critical problem in single-cell genomics of reconstructing dynamic cellular processes from sequencing data. In particular, given a population of cells sampled from such a process, we are interested in the problem of ordering the cells according to their progression in the process. This is known as trajectory inference. If the process is differentiation, this amounts to reconstructing the corresponding differentiation tree. One way of doing this in practice is to estimate the shortest-path distance between nodes based on cell similarities observed in sequencing data. Recent sequencing techniques make it possible to measure two types of data: gene expression levels, and RNA velocity, a vector that predicts changes in gene expression. The data then consist of a discrete vector field on a (subset of a) Euclidean space of dimension equal to the number of genes under consideration. By integrating this velocity field, we trace the evolution of gene expression levels in each single cell from some initial stage to its current stage. Eventually, we assume that we have a faithful embedding of the differentiation tree in a Euclidean space, but which we only observe through the curves representing the paths from the root to the nodes. Using varifold distances between such curves, we define a similarity measure between nodes which we prove approximates the shortest-path distance in a tree that is isomorphic to the target tree.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of radial solutions of semi-linear equations on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions for second-order semi-linear partial differential equations defined on a Riemannian manifold $M$. By combining differential geometry and analysis techniques, we establish the existence and uniqueness of constant solutions through the orbits of a group action. Our approach transforms such problems into equivalent ones over a submanifold $\Sigma$ of dimension one, which is transversal to the group action. This reduction leads us to a one-dimensional setting, where we can apply different results from the theory of ordinary differential equations. Our framework is versatile and includes the setups of polar actions or exponential coordinates, with particular examples such as the sphere, surfaces of revolution, and others.</description>

Abstract: This article provides an overview on various conservation laws for polyharmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds. Besides recalling that the variation of the energy for polyharmonic maps with respect to the domain metric gives rise to the stress-energy tensor, we also show how the presence of a Killing vector field on the target manifold leads to a conservation law. For harmonic and biharmonic maps we also point out a number of applications of such conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Counting Rational Curves and Standard Complex Structures on HyperK\"ahler ALE 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All hyperK\"ahler ALE 4-manifolds with a given non-trivial finite group $\Gamma$ in $SU(2)$ at infinity are parameterized by an open dense subset of a real linear space of dimension $3$rank$\Phi$. Here, $\Phi$ denotes the root system associated with $\Gamma$ via the McKay correspondence. Such manifolds are diffeomorphic to the minimal resolution of a Kleinian singularity. By using the period map of the twistor space, we specify those points in the parameter space at which the hyperK\"ahlerian family of complex structures includes the complex structure of the minimal resolution. Furthermore, we count the rational curves lying on each hyperK\"ahler ALE 4-manifold. For each point in the parameter space, we can assign an integer equals to the number of complex structures which contains rational curves. We show this integer function on the parameter space is lower semi-continuous. In the end, based on known results, we prove that the twistor space of any hyperK\"ahler ALE cannot be K\"ahlerian. In particular, we strengthen some results of Kronheimer (J. Differential Geom., 29(3):665--683, 1989) and provide examples of non-compact and non-K\"ahlerian twistor spaces.</description>

As an application, we show that the set of complete metrics is not closed.</description>

      <title>Null Distance and Temporal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of null distance was introduced by Sormani and Vega as part of a broader program to develop a theory of metric convergence adapted to Lorentzian geometry. Given a time function $\tau$ on a spacetime $(M,g)$, the associated null distance $\hat{d}_\tau$ is constructed from and closely related to the causal structure of $M$. While generally only a semi-metric, $\hat{d}_\tau$ becomes a metric when $\tau$ satisfies the local anti-Lipschitz condition.
  In this work, we focus on temporal functions, that is, differentiable functions whose gradient is everywhere past-directed timelike. Sormani and Vega showed that the class of $C^1$ temporal functions coincides with that of $C^1$ locally anti-Lipschitz time functions. When a temporal function $f$ is smooth, its level sets $M_t = f^{-1}(t)$ are spacelike hypersurfaces and thus Riemannian manifolds endowed with the induced metric $h_t$. Our main result establishes that, on any level set $M_t$ where the gradient $\nabla f$ has constant norm, the null distance $\hat{d}_f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Riemannian distance $d_{h_t}$.
  Applying this result to a smooth regular cosmological time function $\tau_g$ -- as introduced by Andersson, Galloway, and Howard -- we prove a theorem confirming a conjecture of Sakovich and Sormani (arXiv:2410.16800, 2025): if the diameters of the level sets $M_t = \tau_g^{-1}(t)$ shrink to zero as $t \to 0$, then the spacetime exhibits a Big Bang singularity, as defined in their work.</description>

Abstract: This article aims to classify closed vacuum static spaces with a non-Killing closed conformal vector field. We firstly provide several characterizations of the conditions under which the first derivative of the warping function fulfills the vacuum static equation. Then we establish an identity involving the characteristic function of a conformal vector field on a Riemannian manifold. As applications, we derive a rigidity theorem on closed Riemannian manifolds with a non-Killing closed conformal vector field under suitable conditions and classify closed vacuum static spaces admitting such a vector field.</description>

Abstract: Let us consider the set $\Omega (\triangle ABC)$ of all tetrahedra $ABCD$ with a given non-degenerate base $ABC$ in $\mathbb{E}^3$ and $D$ lying outside the plane $ABC$. Let us denote by $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ the set $\left\{\Bigl(\cos \overline{\alpha},\cos \overline{\beta},\cos \overline{\gamma} \Bigr)\in \mathbb{R}^3\,|\, ABCD \in \Omega (\triangle ABC)\right\}$, where $\overline{\alpha}=\angle BDC$, $\overline{\beta}=\angle ADC$, and $\overline{\gamma}=\angle ADB$. The paper is devoted to the problem of determining of the closure of $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and its boundary.</description>

      <title>Simplified Construction of Integer Dimension Hausdorff Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simplified construction of the integer dimension Hausdorff measures is given applying methods of geometry and generalized convergence. This construction prioritizes integration, yields the Area Formula as a byproduct of the construction and the Coarea Formula follows indirectly from the smooth case. Though this construction is not as general as the traditional one, it provides a much simpler introduction to the topic and is enough for certain applications to Geometric Analysis.</description>
