      <title>Some limit theorems for locally stationary Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a law of large numbers and functional central limit theorem for a class of multivariate Hawkes processes with time-dependent reproduction rate. We address the difficulties induced by the use of non-convolutive Volterra processes by recombining classical martingale methods introduced in Bacry et al. [3] with novel ideas proposed by Kwan et al. [19]. The asymptotic theory we obtain yields useful applications in financial statistics. As an illustration, we derive closed-form expressions for price distortions under liquidity constraints.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for Schr\"odinger operators with supercritical killing potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta-V$, where $V$ is a supercritical non-negative potential belonging to a large class of functions containing functions of the form $b|x|^{-(2+2\beta)}$, $b, \beta&gt;0$. We obtain two-sided estimates on the heat kernel $p(t, x, y)$ of $\Delta-V$, along with estimates for the corresponding Green function. Unlike the case of the fractional Schr\"odinger operator $-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}-V$, $\alpha\in (0, 2)$, with supercritical killing potential dealt with in [11], in the present case, the heat kernel $p(t, x, y)$ decays to 0 exponentially as $x$ or $y$ tends to the origin.</description>

      <title>Spinal study of a population model for colonial species with interactions and environmental noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a stochastic model for the dynamics of colonial species, which reproduce through fission or fragmentation. The fission rate depends on the relative sizes of colonies in the population, and the growth rate of colonies is influenced by intrinsic and environmental stochasticities. Our setting thus captures the effect of an external noise, correlating the trait dynamics of all colonies. In particular, we study the effect of the strength of this correlation on the distribution of resources between colonies. We then extend this model to a large class of structured branching processes with interactions in which the particle type evolves according to a diffusion. The branching and death rates are general functions of the whole population. In this framework, we derive a $\psi$-spine construction and a Many-to-One formula, extending previous works on interacting branching processes. Using this spinal construction, we also propose an alternative simulation method and illustrate its efficiency on the colonial population model. The extended framework we propose can model various ecological systems with interactions, and individual and environmental noises.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for fractional $\Phi^3_d$ on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fractional $\Phi^3_d$-measure on the $d$-dimensional torus, with Gaussian free field having inverse covariance $(1-\Delta)^\alpha$, and show a phase transition at $d=3\alpha$. More precisely, in a regular regime $d&lt;3\alpha$, one can construct and normalise this measure, and obtain a measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Gaussian free field $\mu$. At $d=3\alpha$, the behaviour depends on the size $|\sigma|$ of the nonlinearity: for $|\sigma|\ll1$, the measure exists, but is singular with respect to $\mu$, whereas for $|\sigma|\gg1$, the measure is not normalisable. This generalises a result of Oh, Okamoto, and Tolomeo (2025) on the $\Phi^3_3$-measure.</description>

      <title>Improved quasi-invariance result for the periodic Benjamin-Ono-BBM equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend recent results of Genovese-Luca-Tzvetkov (2022) regarding the quasi-invariance of Gaussian measures under the flow of the periodic Benjamin-Ono-BBM (BO-BBM) equation to the full range where BO-BBM is globally well-posed. The main difficulty is due to the critical nature of the dispersion which we overcome by combining the approach of Coe-Tolomeo (2024) with an iteration argument due to Forlano-Tolomeo (2024) to obtain long-time higher integrability bounds on the transported density.</description>

      <title>On the first positive position of a random walker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the first positive position reached by a random walker starting from the origin is fundamental for understanding the statistics of extremes and records in one-dimensional random walks. We present a comprehensive study of this distribution, focusing particularly on its moments and asymptotic tail behaviour, in the case where the step distribution is continuous and symmetric, encompassing both diffusive random walks and L\'evy flights.</description>

Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>Boundedness properties of the maximal operator in a nonsymmetric inverse Gaussian setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized inverse Gaussian setting and consider the maximal operator associated with the natural analogue of a nonsymmetric Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. We prove that it is bounded on $L^{p}$ when $p\in (1,\infty]$ and that it is of weak type $(1,1)$, with respect to the relevant measure. For small values of the time parameter $t$, the proof hinges on the "forbidden zones" method previously introduced in the Gaussian context. But for large times the proof requires new tools.</description>

      <title>Wireless Network Topology Inference: A Markov Chains Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of inferring the topology of a wireless network using limited observational data. Specifically, we assume that we can detect when a node is transmitting, but no further information regarding the transmission is available. We propose a novel network estimation procedure grounded in the following abstract problem: estimating the parameters of a finite discrete-time Markov chain by observing, at each time step, which states are visited by multiple ``anonymous'' copies of the chain. We develop a consistent estimator that approximates the transition matrix of the chain in the operator norm, with the number of required samples scaling roughly linearly with the size of the state space. Applying this estimation procedure to wireless networks, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately infers network topology across a wide range of parameters, consistently outperforming transfer entropy, particularly under conditions of high network congestion.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic interpretation of the Selberg--Delange Method in analytic number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analytic number theory, the Selberg--Delange Method provides an asymptotic formula for the partial sums of a complex function $f$ whose Dirichlet series has the form of a product of a well-behaved analytic function and a complex power of the Riemann zeta function. In probability theory, mod-Poisson convergence is a refinement of convergence in distribution toward a normal distribution. This stronger form of convergence not only implies a Central Limit Theorem but also offers finer control over the distribution of the variables, such as precise estimates for large deviations.
  In this paper, we show that results in analytic number theory derived using the Selberg--Delange Method lead to mod-Poisson convergence as $x \to \infty$ for the number of distinct prime factors of a randomly chosen integer between $1$ and $x$, where the integer is distributed according to a broad class of multiplicative functions.
  As a Corollary, we recover a part of a recent result by Elboim and Gorodetsky under different, though related, conditions: A Central Limit Theorem for the number of distinct prime factors of such random integers.</description>

      <title>Information Theory for Expectation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shannon based his information theory on the notion of probability measures as it we developed by Kolmogorov. In this paper we study some fundamental problems in information theory based on expectation measures. In the theory of expectation measures it is natural to study data sets where no randomness is present and it is also natural to study information theory for point processes as well as sampling where the sample size is not fixed. Expectation measures in combination with Kraft's Inequality can be used to clarify in which cases probability measures can be used to quantify randomness.</description>

      <title>On the Singular Control of a Diffusion and Its Running Infimum or Supremum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of singular stochastic control problems for a one-dimensional diffusion $X$ in which the performance criterion to be optimised depends explicitly on the running infimum $I$ (or supremum $S$) of the controlled process. We introduce two novel integral operators that are consistent with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the resulting two-dimensional singular control problems. The first operator involves integrals where the integrator is the control process of the two-dimensional process $(X,I)$ or $(X,S)$; the second operator concerns integrals where the integrator is the running infimum or supremum process itself. Using these definitions, we prove a general verification theorem for problems involving two-dimensional state-dependent running costs, costs of controlling the process, costs of increasing the running infimum (or supremum) and exit times. Finally, we apply our results to explicitly solve an optimal dividend problem in which the manager's time-preferences depend on the company's historical worst performance.</description>

      <title>Likelihood landscape of binary latent model on a tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimization landscape of maximum likelihood estimation for a binary latent tree model with hidden variables at internal nodes and observed variables at the leaves. This model, known as the Cavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model in statistical phylogenetics, is also a special case of the ferromagnetic Ising model. While the likelihood function is known to be non-concave with multiple critical points in general, gradient descent-type optimization methods have proven surprisingly effective in practice. We provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by analyzing the population likelihood landscape in a neighborhood of the true parameter vector. Under some conditions on the edge parameters, we show that the expected log-likelihood is strongly concave and smooth in a box around the true parameter whose size is independent of both the tree topology and number of leaves. The key technical contribution is a careful analysis of the expected Hessian, showing that its diagonal entries are large while its off-diagonal entries decay exponentially in the graph distance between the corresponding edges. These results provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence for the effectiveness of optimization methods in this setting and may suggest broader principles for understanding optimization in latent variable models on trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a fractal $\mathcal{I}$ whose Hausdorff dimension matches with the upper-box dimension, we propose a new method which consists in selecting inside $\mathcal{I}$ some subsets (called quasi-Cantor sets) of almost same dimension and with controled properties of self-similarties at prescribed scales. It allows us to estimate below the Hausdorff dimension $\mathcal{I}$ intersected to limsup sets of contracted balls selected according a Bernoulli law, in contexts where classical Mass Transference Principles cannot be applied. We apply this result to the computation of the increasing multifractal spectrum of lacunary wavelet series supported on $\mathcal{I}$.</description>

Abstract: Say that a finite group $G$ is mixable if a product of random elements, each chosen independently from two options, can distribute uniformly on $G$. We present conditions and obstructions to mixability. We show that $2$-groups, the symmetric groups, the simple alternating groups, several matrix and sporadic simple groups, and most finite Coxeter groups, are mixable. We also provide bounds on the mixing length of such groups.</description>

      <title>The typical structure of dense claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic number and typical structure of claw-free graphs at constant edge densities. The first of our main results is a formula for the asymptotics of the logarithm of the number of claw-free graphs of edge density $\gamma \in (0,1)$. We show that the problem exhibits a second-order phase transition at edge density $\gamma^\ast=\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{4}$. The asymptotic formula arises by solving a variational problem over graphons. For $\gamma\geq\gamma^\ast$ there is a unique optimal graphon, while for $\gamma&lt;\gamma^\ast$ there is an infinite set of optimal graphons. By analyzing more detailed structure, we prove that for $\gamma&lt;\gamma^\ast$, there is in fact a unique graphon $W$ such that almost all claw-free graphs at edge density $\gamma$ are close in cut metric to $W$. We also analyze the probability of claw-freeness in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ for constant $p$, obtaining a formula for the large-deviation rate function for claw-freeness. In this case, the problem exhibits a first-order phase transition at $p^\ast=\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}$, separating distinct structural regimes. At the critical point $p^\ast$, the corresponding graphon variational problem has infinitely many solutions, and we again pinpoint a unique optimal graphon that describes the typical structure of $G(n,p^\ast)$ conditioned on being claw-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion with stochastic transport is investigated here when the randomdriving process is a very general Gaussian process, including FractionalBrownian motion. The purpose is the comparison with a deterministic PDE, whichin certain cases represents the equation for the mean value. From thisequation we observe a reduced dissipation property for small times and anenhanced diffusion for large times, with respect to delta correlated noisewhen regularity is higher than the one of Brownian motion, a fact interpretedqualitatively here as a signature of the modified dissipation observed for 2Dturbulent fluids due to the inverse cascade. We give results also for thevariance of the solution and for a scaling limit of a two-component noise input.</description>

      <title>Positive Semidefinite Matrix Supermartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic convergence and nonasymptotic maximal inequalities of supermartingales and backward submartingales in the space of positive semidefinite matrices. These are natural matrix analogs of scalar nonnegative supermartingales and backward nonnegative submartingales, whose convergence and maximal inequalities are the theoretical foundations for a wide and ever-growing body of results in statistics, econometrics, and theoretical computer science.
  Our results lead to new concentration inequalities for either martingale dependent or exchangeable random symmetric matrices under a variety of tail conditions, encompassing now-standard Chernoff bounds to self-normalized heavy-tailed settings. Further, these inequalities are usually expressed in the Loewner order, are sometimes valid simultaneously for all sample sizes or at an arbitrary data-dependent stopping time, and can often be tightened via an external randomization factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the open problem concerning the possible lack of concentration of the degree distribution in preferential attachment graphs with random initial degree, when its distribution is characterized by extremely heavy tails of power-law type. We show that the addition of such a large number of edges causes a significant upset of the degree distribution, leading to its non-concentration. Furthermore, we show that the smallest value of the exponent for which the degree distribution exhibits concentration is 2.</description>

      <title>A Kesten Stigum theorem for Galton-Watson processes with infinitely many types in a random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Galton-Watson process $(Z_n)$ with infinitely many types in a random ergodic environment $\bar{\xi}=(\xi_n)_{n\geq 0}$. We focus on the supercritical regime of the process, where the quenched average of the size of the population grows exponentially fast to infinity. We work under Doeblin-type assumptions coming from a previous paper, which ensure that the quenched mean semi group of $(Z_n)$ satisfies some ergodicity property and admits a $\bar{\xi}$-measurable family of space-time harmonic functions. We use these properties to derive an associated nonnegative martingale $(W_n)$. Under a $L\log(L)^{1+\varepsilon}$-integrabilty assumption on the offspring distribution, we prove that the almost sure limit $W$ of the martingale $(W_n)$ is not degenerate. Assuming some uniform $L^2$-integrability of the offspring distribution, we prove that conditionally on $\{W&gt;0\}$, at a large time $n$, both the size of the population and the distribution of types correspond to those of the quenched mean of the population $\mathbb{E}[Z_n|\bar{\xi}, Z_0]$.
  We finally introduce an example of a process modelling a population with a discrete age structure. In this context, we provide more tractable criterions which guarantee our various assumptions are met.</description>

      <title>Refining Concentration for Gaussian Quadratic Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We visit and slightly modify the proof of Hanson-Wright inequality (HW inequality) for concentration of Gaussian quadratic chaos where we are able to tighten the bound by increasing the absolute constant in its formulation from its largest currently known value of 0.125 to at least 0.145 in the symmetric case. We also present a sharper version of the so-called Laurent-Massart inequality (LM inequality) through which we are able to increase the absolute constant in HW inequality from its largest currently available value of $0.134$ due to LM~inequality itself to at least $0.152$ in the positive-semidefinite case. Generalizing HW inequality in the symmetric case, we derive a sequence of concentration bounds for Gaussian quadratic chaos indexed over $m=1,2,3,\cdots$ that involves the Schatten norms of the underlying matrix. The case $m=1$ reduces to HW inequality. These bounds exhibit a phase transition in behaviour in the sense that $m=1$ results in the tightest bound if the deviation is smaller than a critical threshold and the bounds keep getting tighter as the index $m$ increases when the deviation is larger than the aforementioned threshold. Finally, we derive a concentration bound that is asymptotically tighter than HW inequality both in the small and large deviation regimes. Finally, we explore concentration bounds when the underlying matrix is positive-semidefinite and only the dimension~$n$ and its operator norm (largest eigenvalue) are known. Four candidates are examined, namely, the $m_\infty$-bound, relaxed versions of HW and LM bounds and a bound that we refer to as the $\chi^2$-bound.</description>

      <title>Strict inequality between the time constants of first-passage percolation and directed first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the models of first-passage percolation and directed first-passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we consider a family of i.i.d. random variables indexed by the set of edges of the graph, called passage times. For every vertex $x \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ with nonnegative coordinates, we denote by $t(0,x)$ the shortest passage time to go from $0$ to $x$ and by $\vec t(0,x)$ the shortest passage time to go from $0$ to $x$ following a directed path. Under some assumptions, it is known that for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with nonnegative coordinates, $t(0,\lfloor nx \rfloor)/n$ converges to a constant $\mu(x)$ and that $\vec t(0,\lfloor nx \rfloor)/n$ converges to a constant $\vec\mu(x)$. In this paper, we get the strict inequality $\mu(x) &lt; \vec\mu(x)$ as a consequence of a new exponential bound for the comparison of $t(0,x)$ and $\vec{t}(0,x)$ when $\|x\|$ goes to $\infty$. This exponential bound is itself based on a lower bound on the number of edges of geodesics in first-passage percolation (where geodesics are paths with minimal passage time).</description>

      <title>The density of zeros of random power series with stationary complex Gaussian coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the zeros of random power series with stationary complex Gaussian coefficients, whose spectral measure is absolutely continuous. We analyze the precise asymptotic behavior of the radial density of zeros near the boundary of the circle of convergence. The dependence of the coefficients generally reduces the density of zeros compared with that of the hyperbolic Gaussian analytic function (the i.i.d. coefficients case), where the spectral density and its zeros plays a crucial role in this reduction. We also show the relationship between the support of the spectral measure and the analytic continuation at the boundary of the circle of convergence.</description>

      <title>Projected Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms in non-convex and super-linear setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17077v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is of significant interest in many applications to sample from a high-dimensional target distribution $\pi$ with the density $\pi(\text{d} x) \propto e^{-U(x)} (\text{d} x) $, based on the temporal discretization of the Langevin stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this paper, we propose an explicit projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) algorithm with non-convex potential $U$ and super-linear gradient of $U$ and investigate the non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in total variation distance. Equipped with time-independent regularity estimates for the associated Kolmogorov equation, we derive the non-asymptotic bounds on the total variation distance between the target distribution of the Langevin SDEs and the law induced by the PLMC scheme with order $\mathcal{O}(d^{\max\{3\gamma/2 , 2\gamma-1 \}} h |\ln h|)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the target distribution and $\gamma \geq 1$ characterizes the growth of the gradient of $U$. In addition, if the gradient of $U$ is globally Lipschitz continuous, an improved convergence order of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} h)$ for the classical Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) scheme is derived with a refinement of the proof based on Malliavin calculus techniques. To achieve a given precision $\epsilon$, the smallest number of iterations of the PLMC algorithm is proved to be of order ${\mathcal{O}}\big(\tfrac{d^{\max\{3\gamma/2 , 2\gamma-1 \}}}{\epsilon} \ \cdot \ln (\tfrac{d}{\epsilon}) \cdot \ln (\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$. In particular, the classical Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) scheme with the non-convex potential $U$ and the globally Lipschitz gradient of $U$ can be guaranteed by order ${\mathcal{O}}\big(\tfrac{d^{3/2}}{\epsilon} \cdot \ln (\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ count the number of $r$-stars in the random binomial graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. We determine, for fixed $r$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the asymptotics of $\log \mathbb{P}(X \ge (1 + \varepsilon)\mathbb{E} X)$ assuming only $\mathbb{E} X \to \infty$ and $p \to 0$ thus giving a first class of irregular graphs for which the upper tail problem for subgraph counts (stated by Janson and Ruci\'nski in 2004) is solved in the sparse setting.</description>
