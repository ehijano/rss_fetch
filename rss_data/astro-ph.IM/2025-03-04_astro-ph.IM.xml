      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images with Spatially Varying Backgrounds and Point Spread Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>MOMOS: The Multi-Object MKID Optical Spectrometer Simulator and Data Reduction Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MOMOS, the Multi-Object MKID Optical Spectrometer, is a proposed visible wavelength spectrometer that uses MKIDs (Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors) targeting an initial resolving power of 3500. With their modest wavelength-resolving abilities, MKIDs take the place of both the cross disperser and detector in the spectrometer. MKIDs lack read noise and dark current enabling noiseless post-observation rebinning and characterization of faint objects, as well as time-resolved photon counting spectroscopy. This work presents an MOMOS simulator customizable for different MOMOS configurations. Treating simulator products as inputs, an algorithm was developed and implemented in the MOMOS data reduction package to calibrate and extract spectra.</description>

      <title>AI Agents for Ground-Based Gamma Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation instruments for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy are marked by a substantial increase in complexity, featuring dozens of telescopes. This leap in scale introduces significant challenges in managing system operations and offline data analysis. Methods, which depend on advanced personnel training and sophisticated software, become increasingly strained as system complexity grows, making it more challenging to effectively support users in such a multifaceted environment. To address these challenges, we propose the development of AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs). These agents align with specific documentation and codebases, understand the environmental context, operate with external APIs, and communicate with humans in natural language. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs, which can process and retain vast amounts of information, these AI agents offer a transformative approach to system management and data analysis by automating complex tasks and providing intelligent assistance. We present two prototypes that integrate with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory pipelines for operations and offline data analysis. The first prototype automates data model implementation and maintenance for the Configuration Database of the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA). The second prototype is an open-access code generation application tailored for data analysis based on the Gammapy framework.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fiber-Based Radio Frequency Distribution and Vibration Detection System Tailored for Large Radio Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio telescope arrays, such as Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), require highly precise synchronization of time-frequency references to ensure high-quality observational data. Fiber-based frequency distribution systems are highly effective. However, their proper functioning can be threatened by risk events. In this paper, we propose a hybrid fiber-based frequency-distribution and vibration detection system tailored for large radio arrays. The system ensures the performance of distributed frequency signals while allowing for the monitoring of potential threats to the optical fiber network. We design and implement a single-to-multiple hybrid system, conducting tests via a 55-km fiber link. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving the relative frequency stability of 3E-14/1 s and 2.7E-17/1E5 s, along with vibration detection and localization capabilities.</description>

      <title>S-R2D2: a spherical extension of the R2D2 deep neural network series paradigm for wide-field radio-interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the R2D2 paradigm, standing for ''Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic-range imaging'', was introduced for image formation in Radio Interferometry (RI) as a learned version of the traditional algorithm CLEAN. The first incarnations of R2D2 are limited to planar imaging on small fields of view, failing to meet the spherical-imaging requirement of modern telescopes observing wide fields. To address this limitation, we propose the spherical-imaging extension S-R2D2. Firstly, as R2D2, S-R2D2 encapsulates its minor cycles in existing 2D-Euclidean deep neural network (DNN) architectures, but adapts its iterative scheme to incorporate the wide-field measurement model mapping a spherical image to visibility data. We implemented this model as the composition of an efficient Fourier-based interpolator mapping the spherical image onto the equatorial plane, with the standard RI operator mapping the equatorial-plane image to visibility data. Importantly, the interpolation step must inevitably be performed at a lower-than-optimal resolution on the plane, to meet the high-resolution requirement on the sphere of wide-field imaging while preserving scalability. Therefore, secondly, we design S-R2D2's DNN training loss to jointly learn to correct the interpolation approximations and identify residual image structures on the sphere, ensuring consistency with the spherical ground truth using the adjoint plane-to-sphere interpolator. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations S-R2D2's capability to perform fast and accurate reconstructions of spherical monochromatic intensity images, across high-resolution, high-dynamic-range settings.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Neural Networks: Emulating Late Burning Stages in Core Collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in modeling massive stars to the onset of core collapse is the computational bottleneck of nucleosynthesis during advanced burning stages. The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of fully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the simulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability. To overcome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with multiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate its performance. The NNN takes the temperature, density and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting isotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates. We generate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core depletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the predictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net. We find that the NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by $280-660\:\%$ and the nuclear energy generation by $250-750\:\%$, consistently outperforming the small network across all timesteps. They also achieve significantly better predictions of neutrino losses on relatively short timescales, with improvements ranging from $100-10^{6}\:\%$. While further work is needed to enhance their accuracy and applicability to different stellar conditions, integrating NNN trained models into stellar evolution codes is promising for facilitating large-scale generation of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors with higher physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger observations in the Einstein Telescope era: binary neutron star and black hole - neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), a proposed next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatory, will expand the reach of GW astronomy of stellar-mass compact object binaries to unprecedented distances, enhancing opportunities for multi-messenger observations. Here we investigate multi-messenger emission properties of binary neutron star (NSNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers detectable by ET, providing projections to optimize observational strategies and maximize scientific insights from these sources. Using a synthetic population of compact binary mergers, we model each source's GW signal-to-noise ratio, sky localization uncertainty, kilonova (KN) light curves in optical and near-infrared bands, fluence of the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission and afterglow light curves across radio, optical, X-ray and very high energy wavelengths. We analyze multi-messenger detectability prospects for ET as a standalone observatory with two different configurations and within a network of next-generation GW detectors. ET will detect over $10^4$ NSNS mergers annually, enabling potential observation of tens to hundreds of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. BHNS mergers have more limited multi-messenger prospects, but joint GW-EM rates will increase by an order of magnitude compared to current-generation instruments. We quantify uncertainties due to the NS equation of state (EoS) and mass distribution of NSNSs, as well as the NS EoS and BH spin for BHNSs. While a single ET will achieve an impressive GW detection rate, the fraction of well-localized events is orders of magnitude lower than in a network with additional detectors. This significantly limits efficient EM follow-up and science cases requiring well-characterized counterparts or early observations. The challenge is even greater for BHNS mergers due to their low EM rate.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed for analyzing the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in the detection of CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>

      <title>The highly magnetic Wolf-Rayet binary HD 45166 resolved with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HD 45166 was recently reported to be a long-period binary comprising a B7V star and a highly magnetic ($\langle B \rangle = 43.0\pm0.5\,$kG) hot Wolf-Rayet-like component, dubbed as a quasi Wolf-Rayet (qWR) star in literature. While originally proposed to be a short-period binary, long-term spectroscopic monitoring suggested a 22.5 yr orbital period. With a derived dynamical mass of $2.03\pm0.44\,M_\odot$, the qWR component is the most strongly magnetized non-degenerate object ever detected and a potential magnetar progenitor. However, the long period renders the spectroscopic orbital solution and dynamical mass estimates uncertain, casting doubts on whether the qWR component is massive enough to undergo core-collapse. Here, we spatially resolve the HD 45166 binary using newly acquired interferometric data obtained with the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Due to the calibrator star being a binary as well, we implement a new approach for visibility calibration and test it thoroughly using archival GRAVITY data. The newly calibrated HD 45166 data reveal the unmistakable presence of a companion to the qWR component with an angular separation of $10.9\pm0.1$ mas (which translates to a projected physical separation of $10.8\pm0.4$ au), consistent with the long-period orbit. We obtain a model-independent qWR mass $M_{\rm qWR} = 1.96^{+0.74}_{-0.54}\,M_\odot$ using interferometric and spectroscopic data together. This observation robustly confirms that HD 45166 is truly a long-period binary, and provides an anchor point for accurate mass determination of the qWR component with further observations.</description>

      <title>Quantified Estimation of Molecular Detections across Different Classes of Neptunian Atmospheres Using Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy: Prospects for Future Extremely Large Telescopes with High-Resolution Spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neptune-size exoplanets are less studied as characterizing their atmospheres presents challenges due to their relatively small radius and atmospheric scale height. As the most common outcome of planet formation, these planets are crucial for understanding planetary formation, migration theories, atmospheric composition, and potential habitability. Their diverse atmospheres, influenced by equilibrium temperature, composition, and cloud presence, offer unique opportunities to study atmospheric dynamics and chemistry. While low-resolution spectroscopy struggles with atmospheric characterization due to clouds, high-resolution observations provide detailed analysis of the atmospheres by detecting molecular lines beyond the cloud deck. This study investigates four subclasses of Neptune atmospheres: HAT-P-11 b (warm Neptune), HD 63433 c (warm sub-Neptune), K2-25 b (temperate Neptune), and TOI-270 d (temperate sub-Neptune), using six ground-based spectrographs: GIANO-B, CARMENES, IGRINS, HISPEC, MODHIS, and ANDES over one and three transits. Our simulation integrates the chemical kinetics model, VULCAN with the 1-D line-by-line radiative transfer model, petitRADTRANS, and estimates detection significance using the ground-based noise simulator, SPECTR. We aim to predict how future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) such as TMT (MODHIS) and E-ELT (ANDES) can utilize their higher resolving powers and larger collecting areas to surpass current observatories in detecting molecular bands. We highlight the importance of photochemistry in these atmospheres and demonstrate how ELTs will help further in constraining nitrogen and sulfur chemistry. Finally, we present a comprehensive picture of cloud presence in the atmospheres and its impact on molecular detectability in Neptune-class atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Plans for a new array of radio antennas for the detection of air showers at the 433m surface-detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and science case for a new array of radio antennas to be located at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Six stations of three SKALA antennas each will be deployed around a single water-Cherenkov surface detector triggering the radio readout. The planned antenna layout will allow for the detection of cosmic rays above a few tens of PeV and reach full efficiency for vertical air showers at several hundred PeV in primary energy. The array will thus be a pathfinder to demonstrate that fully-efficient radio detection in combination with the underground muon detectors already present at the location is possible. This will enable combined studies of the muon component and the depth of shower maximum, relevant for hadronic interaction models studies and more accurate determination of the cosmic-ray mass composition in the energy range of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition.</description>

      <title>The Kratos Framework for Heterogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Fundamental Infrastructures and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of astrophysics has long sought computational tools capable of harnessing the power of modern GPUs to simulate the complex dynamics of astrophysical phenomena. The Kratos Framework, a novel GPU-based simulation system designed to leverage heterogeneous computing architectures, is introduced to address these challenges. Kratos offers a flexible and efficient platform for a wide range of astrophysical simulations, by including its device abstraction layer, multiprocessing communication model, and mesh management system that serves as the foundation for the physical module container. Focusing on the hydrodynamics module as an example and foundation for more complex simulations, optimizations and adaptations have been implemented for heterogeneous devices that allows for accurate and fast computations, especially the mixed precision method that maximize its efficiency on consumer-level GPUs while holding the conservation laws to machine accuracy. The performance and accuracy of Kratos are verified through a series of standard hydrodynamic benchmarks, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for astrophysical research.</description>

      <title>Nouvelle theorie des taches du Soleil, by E. Pezenas (1692-1776). A fully annoted edition of a manuscript</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manuscript New Theory of Sunspots was identified and attributed to the Jesuit astronomer and hydrographer from Marseille Esprit Pezenas (1692-1776) during the year 2002, during the systematic search for papers concerning him in the various French funds. The manuscript, in large part unpublished, New Theory of Sunspots was written by astronomer and professor of Marseilles Jesuit hydrography, Father Esprit Pezenas (1692-1776). The text was composed and revised between the years 1766 and 1772. In this manuscript, of which we are going to study the conditions of its composition, P. Pezenas gives one of the last geometric methods, related graphical methods, allowing the inclination of the Sun's equator to be deduced on ecliptic, using three observations of a sunspot, at given times, and in taking into account the movement of the Earth with respect to the Sun during the duration of observations. This text contains all the digital elements allowing to follow and understand the application of geometric processing methods of observations and observation techniques mentioned above in the introduction: passages of edges and Sun spots at the meridian, use of objective micrometers and wire micrometers. At detour of his calculations, Father Pezenas announces a duration of about 26 days and 9 hours for the rotation of the Sun around its axis, comments on and corrects some observation data published in Le Monnier's Heavenly History.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Radio Telescope Dark Matter Search in the L and S Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic dark matter in its most general form can be detected through its decay or annihilation to a quasimonochromatic radio line. Assuming only that this line is consistent with the most general properties of the expected phase space of our Milky Way halo, we have developed and carried out a novel model-independent search for dark matter in the L and S bands. More specifically, the search selects for a line that exhibits a Doppler shift with position according to the solar motion through a static halo and similarly varies in intensity with position with respect to the galactic center. Over the combined L- and S-band range 1020 - 2700 MHz, radiative annihilation of dark matter is excluded above $\langle\sigma v\rangle \approx 10^{-30} \text{ cm}^3 \text{ s}^{-1}$, and for decay above $\lambda \approx 10^{-32} \text{ s}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The azimuthal distribution of ejecta mass from oblique impacts into sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure ejecta mass as a function of azimuthal and impact angle for 104 m/s oblique impacts into sand. We find that the ejecta mass distribution is strongly sensitive to azimuthal angle with as high as 8 times more mass in ejecta on the downrange side compared to the uprange side. Crater radii, measured from the impact point, are measured at different impact and azimuthal angles. Crater ejecta scaling laws are modified to depend on azimuthal and impact angle. We find that crater radii are sensitive to both impact and azimuthal angle but the ejecta mass as a function of both angles can be estimated from the cube of the crater radius without an additional angular dependent function. The ejecta distributions are relevant for processes that depend upon the integrated properties of approximately 100 m/s impacts occurring in the outer solar system and possibly during planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surfaces of some icy moons, such as Jupiter's moon Europa, are heavily bombarded by energetic particles that can alter the surface materials and affect the composition of its exosphere. Detection of CO2 on Europa's surface indicate that Europa's interior may be transporting freshly exposed carbon-containing material to the surface. It is unknown whether this CO2 is a product of radiation of carbon-containing precursors or whether it is present in the initial deposits. Regardless, further radiolysis by high-energy electrons or ions can sputter CO2 (and organic fragments if present) into Europa's exosphere. In this study, we investigate the radiation sputtering of CO2 and organic fragments from hydrocarbon water ice mixtures at different Europa-relevant surface temperatures to identify how its sputtering products evolve over time. This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Instrumental Drift in MAROON-X using an Ensemble Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MAROON-X is a state-of-the-art extreme precision radial velocity spectrograph deployed on the 8.1-meter Gemini-N telescope on Maunakea, Hawai'i. Using a stabilized Fabry-P\'erot etalon for wavelength and drift calibration, MAROON-X has achieved a short-term precision of $\sim$\,30\,cm\,s$^{-1}$. However, due to a long-term drift in the etalon (2.2\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ per day) and various interruptions of the instrument baseline over the first few years of operation, MAROON-X experiences RV offsets between observing runs several times larger than the short-term precision during any individual run, which hinders the detection of longer-period signals. In this study, we analyze RV measurements of 11 targets that either exhibit small RV scatter or have signals that can be precisely constrained using Keplerian or Gaussian Process models. Leveraging this ensemble, we calibrate MAROON-X's run offsets for data collected between September 2020 and early January 2024 to a precision of $\sim$0.5\,m\,s$^{-1}$. When applying these calibrated offsets to HD 3651, a quiet star, we obtain residual velocities with an RMS of $&lt;$70\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ in both the Red and Blue channels of MAROON-X over a baseline of 29 months. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of MAROON-X data calibrated with these offsets through a series of injection-recovery tests. Based on our findings, MAROON-X is capable of detecting sub m\,s$^{-1}$ signals out to periods of more than 1,000 days.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.</description>
