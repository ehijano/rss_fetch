      <title>Reducing Compute Waste in LLMs through Kernel-Level DVFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI has fueled the expansion of accelerator- or GPU-based data centers. However, the rising operational energy consumption has emerged as a critical bottleneck and a major sustainability concern. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a well-known technique used to reduce energy consumption, and thus improve energy-efficiency, since it requires little effort and works with existing hardware. Reducing the energy consumption of training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) through DVFS or power capping is feasible: related work has shown energy savings can be significant, but at the cost of significant slowdowns. In this work, we focus on reducing waste in LLM operations: i.e., reducing energy consumption without losing performance. We propose a fine-grained, kernel-level, DVFS approach that explores new frequency configurations, and prove these save more energy than previous, pass- or iteration-level solutions. For example, for a GPT-3 training run, a pass-level approach could reduce energy consumption by 2% (without losing performance), while our kernel-level approach saves as much as 14.6% (with a 0.6% slowdown). We further investigate the effect of data and tensor parallelism, and show our discovered clock frequencies translate well for both. We conclude that kernel-level DVFS is a suitable technique to reduce waste in LLM operations, providing significant energy savings with negligible slow-down.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography Key Expansion Method and Anonymous Certificate Scheme Based on NTRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NTRU is one of the important lattice-based post-quantum cryptography methods, offering resistance against quantum computing attacks. However, a drawback of NTRU lies in its relatively low efficiency in generating key pairs. Therefore, this study proposes an NTRU-based key expansion method that enables efficient public key expansion. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to an anonymous certificate scheme, allowing an end entity to generate a key pair only once, after which the certificate authority can expand multiple distinct public keys for anonymity. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed key expansion method achieves significantly higher efficiency than key pair generation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Precision and Recursion for Accelerating Symmetric Linear Solves on MXUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric linear solves are fundamental to a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, from climate modeling and structural analysis to machine learning and optimization. These workloads often rely on Cholesky (POTRF) decomposition and its supporting operations, triangular solves (TRSM) and symmetric rank-k updates (SYRK), which together form the computational core for solving symmetric positive-definite systems. To accelerate these kernels, we present a portable, mixed-precision solver designed for Matrix Processing Units (MXUs), including NVIDIA Tensor Cores (H200) and AMD Matrix Cores (MI300X). Our algorithm builds on a nested recursive formulation in which Cholesky exposes parallelism through recursive decomposition of its TRSM and SYRK sub-problems. This structure yields a hierarchical recursion that maximizes GEMM throughput while enabling fine-grained control over numerical precision. We introduce a custom recursive data structure that assigns low-precision FP16 arithmetic to large off-diagonal blocks, while preserving high precision on diagonal blocks to ensure numerical stability. The solver is implemented in Julia, leveraging array programming, multiple dispatch, and dynamic type inference to enable seamless expression of mixed-precision computation. This design provides a high-level, hardware-agnostic interface while efficiently interfacing with low-level vendor libraries for backend portability. On H200, our recursive FP64 SYRK achieves a 14x speedup over cuBLAS, while mixed-precision delivers up to 27x speedup in SYRK and 5x in TRSM over full-precision baselines. This results in a 5x overall speedup for Cholesky versus cuSOLVER FP64, with 100x better accuracy than pure FP16 while retaining 88% of its peak speedup. Comparable performance and accuracy trends are observed on MI300X, demonstrating broad applicability across GPUs.</description>

      <title>Shifting the Sweet Spot: High-Performance Matrix-Free Method for High-Order Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-order finite element analysis for elasticity, matrix-free (PA) methods are a key technology for overcoming the memory bottleneck of traditional Full Assembly (FA). However, existing implementations fail to fully exploit the special structure of modern CPU architectures and tensor-product elements, causing their performance "sweet spot" to anomalously remain at the low order of $p \approx 2$, which severely limits the potential of high-order methods. To address this challenge, we design and implement a highly optimized PA operator within the MFEM framework, deeply integrated with a Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. Our multi-level optimization strategy includes replacing the original $O(p^6)$ generic algorithm with an efficient $O(p^4)$ one based on tensor factorization, exploiting Voigt symmetry to reduce redundant computations for the elasticity problem, and employing macro-kernel fusion to enhance data locality and break the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Extensive experiments on mainstream x86 and ARM architectures demonstrate that our method successfully shifts the performance "sweet spot" to the higher-order region of $p \ge 6$. Compared to the MFEM baseline, the optimized core operator (kernel) achieves speedups of 7x to 83x, which translates to a 3.6x to 16.8x end-to-end performance improvement in the complete solution process. This paper provides a validated and efficient practical path for conducting large-scale, high-order elasticity simulations on mainstream CPU hardware.</description>

      <title>Taming Cold Starts: Proactive Serverless Scheduling with Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serverless computing has transformed cloud application deployment by introducing a fine-grained, event-driven execution model that abstracts away infrastructure management. Its on-demand nature makes it especially appealing for latency-sensitive and bursty workloads. However, the cold start problem, i.e., where the platform incurs significant delay when provisioning new containers, remains the Achilles' heel of such platforms.
  This paper presents a predictive serverless scheduling framework based on Model Predictive Control to proactively mitigate cold starts, thereby improving end-to-end response time. By forecasting future invocations, the controller jointly optimizes container prewarming and request dispatching, improving latency while minimizing resource overhead.
  We implement our approach on Apache OpenWhisk, deployed on a Kubernetes-based testbed. Experimental results using real-world function traces and synthetic workloads demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 85% lower tail latency and a 34% reduction in resource usage.</description>

      <title>CounterPoint: Using Hardware Event Counters to Refute and Refine Microarchitectural Assumptions (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardware event counters offer the potential to reveal not only performance bottlenecks but also detailed microarchitectural behavior. In practice, this promise is undermined by their vague specifications, opaque designs, and multiplexing noise, making event counter data hard to interpret.
  We introduce CounterPoint, a framework that tests user-specified microarchitectural models - expressed as $\mu$path Decision Diagrams - for consistency with performance counter data. When mismatches occur, CounterPoint pinpoints plausible microarchitectural features that could explain them, using multi-dimensional counter confidence regions to mitigate multiplexing noise. We apply CounterPoint to the Haswell Memory Management Unit as a case study, shedding light on multiple undocumented and underdocumented microarchitectural behaviors. These include a load-store queue-side TLB prefetcher, merging page table walkers, abortable page table walks, and more.
  Overall, CounterPoint helps experts reconcile noisy hardware performance counter measurements with their mental model of the microarchitecture - uncovering subtle, previously hidden hardware features along the way.</description>
