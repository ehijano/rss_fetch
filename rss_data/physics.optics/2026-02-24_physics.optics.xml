      <title>Inverse design for scalable photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, photonic inverse design has emerged as a powerful approach to implement photonic devices with improved performance, or realize new functionalities. While the efforts over the first decade focused on proof of concept devices designed and fabricated in university labs, the focus over the past 5-10 years has shifted towards implementation of scalable photonic systems. This article reviews this recent progress, challenges and new directions in photonics inverse design, thus providing a complementary and updated review of the field. We focus on large scale three dimensional photonic inverse design, including metasurfaces, translation of inverse design to commercial foundries and practical silicon photonics, application of photonic inverse design to different materials systems, wavelengths, and optical effects, and finally new directions such as inverse design of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Extended scattering channels for random matrix simulations of polarized light transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the propagation of light through disordered media is central to understanding and controlling wave transport in diverse optical and mesoscopic applications. Here, we present a random matrix simulation framework for modeling the transport of polarized light through random media composed of arbitrary particulate scatterers. Our approach employs extended scattering channels applied to angular spectral decompositions of the underlying fields, enabling flexible representations of arbitrary illumination and detection profiles. In contrast to previous work, this framework provides a rigorous treatment of scattering matrix correlations and offers novel geometric insights into the optical memory effect. We provide a detailed exposition of the underlying theory and illustrate several key features through numerical simulations. Our work is supported by a free accompanying codebase.</description>

      <title>Multi-ring necklace vortex solitons in Kerr nonlinear media with azimuthally modulated Bessel potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the existence, stability, and dynamics of single-ring and multi-ring vorticity-carrying necklace solitons under the action of the Kerr nonlinearity and a Bessel-lattice potential modulated in the azimuthal direction. The model may be realized in the spatial domain for bulk optical waveguides, the spatiotemporal domain for optical cavities, and for effectively two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. The setup supports single- and multi-ring necklace vortex patterns, including monopoles, dipoles, tripoles, quadrupoles, pentapoles, sextupoles, octupoles, and 12-poles. In contrast with the inherent instability of conventional vortex beams with high topological charges (winding numbers), vortex necklace-shaped solitons with large winding numbers are found to be stable in the present setup. In particular, octupoles exhibit stable breathing dynamics, and 12-pole necklaces with high winding numbers may be stable. These findings provide a new way for generating stable vortex necklaces, offering a vast potential for manipulations of complex spatiotemporal light fields.</description>

      <title>Liquid photonic-molecule microlasers for ultrasensitive biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet microlasers, as promising tools for biophotonics and biomedical sciences, have witnessed rapid advances due to their flexible reconfigurability, high sensitivity to stimuli, and label-free biosensing ability. However, designing these biosensors with simultaneously critical properties of low lasing threshold, high spectral purity, and ultimate sensitivity remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile strategy to build liquid photonic molecules (LPMs) that combine all these features in a single device. We find that through tailoring the spectral Vernier overlap in size-mismatched droplets, this device enables single-mode lasing with a low threshold of ~610 nJ mm-2. The LPM lasers are engineered for dynamic tunability using a molecular isomerization strategy, which induces spectral mode hopping and thus yields a nearly ten-fold enhancement in spectral sensitivity over single droplets. Moreover, by leveraging the self-referenced intensity response of the LPM lasing modes, we demonstrate a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in biomolecular sensing, with a detection limit of 30 aM and a dynamic range spanning nine orders of magnitude. Our work offers exciting prospects for bio-integrated liquid sensors in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband, compact, and training-free optical processors for parallel image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly prevalent, the demand for faster and more energy-efficient computing approaches grows. While optical computing offers intrinsic advantages in bandwidth and power consumption, existing implementations remain bulky, wavelength-specific, and dependent on complex training procedures, limiting scalability and parallel operation. In this work, we demonstrate a compact, training-free optical processor based on wavy diffractive features, known as Fourier surfaces, for parallel image classification. Our device achieves classification accuracies of up to 84% for digit datasets and 66% for fashion datasets within a 40$\times$40 $\mu$m$^2$ footprint. The diffractive layer inherently separates incident wavelengths into distinct output directions, enabling broadband operation and allowing multiple colors to function as independent computation channels. As a result, this passive system supports up to 20 simultaneous computations within a single optical pass. These results highlight the potential of nanoscale diffractive systems to achieve high compute densities, paving the way for scalable, low-power optical processors for machine learning and image-recognition applications.</description>

      <title>Space-time beams with tunable orbital group velocity for plasma superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light springs are space-time beams that have a helical wavepacket. Due to this special property, light springs result into a rotating pulse when intercepting a plane lying orthogonal to their propagation direction. Associated to this, we introduce here the orbital group velocity, an additional tunable property of light springs. The orbital group velocity quantifies the speed of the light spring intensity rotation, distinctly from the conventional longitudinal group velocity, which describes the motion of the wavepacket envelope along its propagation axis. We demonstrate experimentally by tunable Fourier synthesis that the orbital group velocity can assume sub- and superluminal values, thus becoming a new platform for synthetic motion studies and control of laser-matter interactions. Particularly, in the superluminal regime, when interacting with a thin overdense plasma, we reveal by particle-in-cell simulations that the light spring unlocks superradiant radiation, due to the coherent excitation of the electrons in the plasma acting as a quasiparticle. This superradiant source inherits the ultrafast temporal dynamics of the light springs while emitting in the terahertz region, thus creating a new source of terahertz radiation controlled by the properties of spatiotemporal coupling of the laser. Therefore, spatiotemporal tuning of light springs is at the frontier of controlling laser-matter interaction and generating new tunable sources of radiation.</description>

      <title>Generalized diffusion theory for radiative transfer in fully anisotropic scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized anisotropic-diffusion framework is developed for transport problem in media described by a tensorial scattering coefficient and a scalar Henyey--Greenstein asymmetry factor. In this regime the classical similarity relation between scattering and transport parameters fails, and each principal diffusion coefficient depends on all components of the microscopic scattering rate. Explicit expressions are derived for the direction-averaged mean free path, the diagonal elements of the diffusion tensor, and boundary condition lengths via rapidly convergent spherical-harmonics expansions, along with open-source implementations. The resulting predictions are validated against anisotropic Monte Carlo simulations, showing excellent agreement across broad ranges of structural anisotropy and phase-function asymmetry factors. The theory provides a compact, general route connecting microscopic anisotropic scattering to macroscopic diffusion coefficients and boundary conditions in bounded geometries.</description>

      <title>Twisted multilayer moir\'e water waves topologically robust to disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, stacking and twisting multilayer periodic lattices into superlattices, have become cornerstones of many physical systems from condensed matter to wave phenomena, but have never been properly studied in water waves. Here, we demonstrate twisted multilayer moir\'e water surface waves carrying robust skyrmionic topologies. Using a custom water tank of circular multi-channel phased array, we precisely generate water-wave skyrmion lattices and superimpose them into moir\'e superlattices with higher-order topological textures, e.g., skyrmion bags and clusters, programmed via the twist angle. We also quantitatively compare the topological robustness of bilayer and trilayer configurations under spatiotemporal perturbations. The trilayer moir\'e superlattices exhibit more enhanced stability, stronger field localization and energy concentration than the bilayer. Our work establishes water waves as a macroscopic, tunable, and visually accessible platform for moir\'e physics, towards robust particle manipulation and classical analogues of topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network for Inverse Design of Integrated Photonic Biosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic biosensors provide compact, highly sensitive, and label-free platforms for biochemical detection, making them attractive for on-chip and real-time sensing applications. However, their design remains challenging due to complex resonance behaviour, strong coupling effects, and the computational cost associated with repeated full-wave electromagnetic simulations. In particular, inverse design of microring resonator-based sensors requires accurate modelling of geometry-spectrum relationships while satisfying physical constraints such as resonance conditions and spectral sensitivity requirements. In this work, we propose a physics-informed graph neural network (PI-GNN) for the inverse design of a microring resonator biosensor operating in the 1550 nm band. By representing the photonic structure as a graph and embedding resonance-based physical constraints directly into the learning objective, the model captures both structural connectivity and underlying electromagnetic principles. The proposed approach enables efficient prediction of device geometries that achieve target spectral characteristics, reducing reliance on costly simulations while maintaining physical consistency and competitive design accuracy.</description>

      <title>Temporal Coupled Mode Theory for a Single Floquet-Sheet Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous Temporal Coupled-Mode Theory (TCMT) specifically tailored for a single Floquet-sheet resonator governed by time-modulated conductivities. By invoking photon-number conservation during frequency conversion, we derive characteristic radiative decay rates and coupling coefficients that account for the frequency ratio between channels. We establish a systematic bridge to the Floquet Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), providing closed-form analytical expressions that map scattering parameters to the Drude-type physics of the sheet. Our model explicitly captures the resonant coupling between the 0th-order propagating channel and the -1st-order surface-mode channel. Validated by COMSOL numerical simulations, the theory remains robust even when intrinsic material loss is incorporated. This framework offers an intuitive pole-expansion representation for designing time-varying photonic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural networks implemented through spatiotemporal light propagation in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks excel at temporal tasks and video processing but require energy-intensive sequential memory operations. We demonstrate that multimode optical fibers naturally implement spatiotemporal recurrent computation through passive light propagation. Video frames are encoded onto separate optical beams with controlled time delays; these beams combine and recirculate through a fiber loop where interference and nonlinear propagation generate high-dimensional states encoding both current inputs and fading memory. Remarkably, the entire optical system remains fixed with no trainable parameters or electronic feedback, yet this single physical configuration achieves competitive performance across diverse temporal and spatiotemporal learning tasks: chaotic time-series forecasting, human action recognition, steering angle prediction, and surgical skill assessment. Our results show that recurrent temporal processing can emerge directly from spatiotemporal wave dynamics. This paradigm shift from algorithmic to physical recurrence offers an energy-efficient pathway to temporal artificial intelligence by leveraging intrinsic spatiotemporal optical nonlinearities within multimode fibers.</description>

      <title>Superresolution technique beyond the diffraction limit under a structured beam via different optical nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the limit of diffraction while achieving the superresolution technique, solid immersion lenses are the key optical elements for data storage and nanophotonics applications. Recent demonstrations have shown how different nanostructures (such as elliptical SILs) are used in diverse fields of increasing resolution in the presence of a structured Gaussian beam. By applying twisted beams such as angular momentum beams (Laguerre- Gaussian) and spatial higher-order Gaussian beams (Hermite- Gauss), we can attain a sharp (FWHM = 27 nm) near-field focal spot pattern, which is considerably better than the conventional macroscopic SIL. By numerical simulations, tolerance has been confirmed with a slight variation in beam size and geometrical modification to make the model compatible with fabrication errors. This narrow bandwidth intensity distribution can be utilized for scanning the sample with higher resolution, especially in the field of quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Profiling THz Beams With Off-Label Use of Infrared Microbolometric Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Circular V-grooves on single-crystal gold: optical properties and sensing feasibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystal Au(111) microplates provide an ultra-smooth, low-defect platform for reproducible plasmonic nanocavities. Here we realize reflection-mode whispering-gallery metasurfaces comprising periodic arrays of circular V-groove cavities milled into optically thick Au microplates and characterize their visible--near-IR response. The measured spectra exhibit narrow, depth-tunable Fano-like reflectance minima with weak azimuthal dependence, reproduced by quarter-cell finite-element modeling consistent with strong gap-surface-plasmon confinement. For refractometric sensing, simulations yield bulk sensitivities up to $\sim 598$ nm RIU$^{-1}$ and figures of merit up to $\sim 33$ (hexagonal lattice). As a model-based illustration, a functionalized architecture targeting \textit{Plasmodium falciparum} lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH), a common malaria target of rapid diagnostic tests, gives an estimated limit of detection of $0.016$ nM ($\sim 0.56$ ng mL$^{-1}$) under the adopted noise floor.</description>

      <title>Composition-Dependent Plasmon-Enhanced Emission in Lead-Free Cs$_3$Cu$_2$X$_5$ Halides: A DFT--FDTD Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free Cs$_3$Cu$_2$X$_5$ (X = Cl, Br, I) halides exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields and excellent ambient stability, yet light-emitting devices based on these materials remain limited by poor optical outcoupling. In this work, we develop an integrated density functional theory (DFT) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework to establish quantitative links between halide composition, wavelength-dependent optical constants, and plasmonic enhancement. First-principles calculations are used to obtain composition-specific refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) spectra, which are directly implemented into three-dimensional FDTD simulations of a complete PeLED stack incorporating Ag/SiO$_2$ core--shell nanostructures. Among the investigated compositions, Cs$_3$Cu$_2$Cl$_5$ demonstrates the strongest plasmonic response, achieving a 4.4$\times$ Purcell enhancement and 30\% light extraction efficiency (LEE) using optimized nanorods. The superior performance originates from its lower refractive index, which reduces dielectric screening and improves near-field coupling. Cs$_3$Cu$_2$Br$_5$ exhibits the highest spectral overlap ($J_{\mathrm{cos}} = 0.955$) but yields moderate extraction (26%) due to increased optical confinement. Cs$_3$Cu$_2$I$_5$ requires a nanosphere geometry and shows limited enhancement, with LEE restricted to 10%. Distance-ependent analysis reveals composition-specific optimal emitter--plasmon separations, ranging from 8--12 nm for Cs$_3$Cu$_2$Br$_5$ to approximately 15 nm for Cs$_3$Cu$_2$Cl$_5$. These results provide composition-dependent design guidelines for plasmon-enhanced lead-free PeLEDs and highlight the critical role of accurate optical constants in predictive device optimization.</description>

      <title>Particle-like topologies of light in turbulent complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic building blocks of many forms of optical topologies are particle-like singularities in phase and polarisation, giving rise to lines of darkness that weave complex threads in 3D space. Although known for half a century since seminal work on dislocations in wave trains, their behaviour in complex media remains under debate, especially with respect to their relative stability. Here we show that polarisation and phase vortices behave identically in one-sided turbulent complex channels. We perform complementary numerical and experimental studies using atmospheric turbulence as a test case, demonstrating agreement and equivalent dynamics. Our work addresses open questions on optical topologies and will be relevant to their harnessing for applications such as sensing, communication, imaging, and information transfer in noisy or complex environments.</description>

      <title>Gabor Holography Reinvented</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a "reinvention" of Gabor Holography that does not suffer optically from the inherent twin-image problem originating back to Gabor's original Nobel Prize awarded invention. In-line or on-axis holography was ironically abandoned by its inventor Dennis Gabor himself and was effectively completely "re-placed" by so-called off-axis holography at the time when Gabor received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971. However, Gabor Holography is today the method of choice in modern digital holography due to its inherent on-axis, common-path robustness, lower requirements to resolution of the image sensor (or recording material), shorter exposure time, relaxed mechanical stability and temporal coherence requirements. However, it still inherently suffers from the aforementioned twin-image problem and, hence, one will find an abundance of papers trying to overcome this challenge by iterative phase retrieval or machine learning based approaches. Gabor Holography Reinvented overcomes this long-lasting twin-image problem for the first time by optical means.</description>

      <title>Twist-Engineered Nonlinearity in Two-Dimensional Crystals for Tailored Quantum Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials enable nonlinear-optical engineering with unprecedented resolution: their strong second-order susceptibilities ($\chi^{(2)}$) and twist-tunable interlayer symmetry allow the effective nonlinearity to be shaped continuously, rather than through binary $\pm\chi^{(2)}$ domain inversion as in bulk ferroelectrics. Here, we show that twist-angle domain engineering exploits this continuous degree of freedom to reconstruct target longitudinal nonlinearity profiles with high fidelity. Using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) as a benchmark, we demonstrate that twist-engineered vdW crystals yield significantly improved approximations of target phase-matching functions and correspondingly higher single-photon purities, particularly in compact devices where fabrication constraints limit conventional approaches. We further show that this framework remains effective in experimentally relevant vdW materials and demanding non-degenerate wavelength regimes involving mid-infrared photons. More broadly, the ability to continuously and locally program $\chi^{(2)}$ establishes a general framework for tailoring a wide range of SPDC properties, including absolute brightness, joint spectral amplitude structure, signal-idler frequency separation, and temporal wavepacket shape beyond what is accessible in conventional nonlinear crystals. These results position vdW heterostructures as a powerful platform for engineered quantum light sources and open new opportunities for nonlinear-optical devices shaped with monolayer thickness scale.</description>

      <title>Two-spin-multiplexed optoacoustic light storage in chiral photonic crystal fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to coherently store and manipulate optical information across multiple degrees of freedom is a central requirement for scalable quantum information processing and multidimensional quantum computing. While polarization- and space-division-multiplexing have substantially increased the capacity of classical optical systems, their extension to coherent and reconfigurable photonic memories remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-spin-channel-multiplexed photonic memory based on chiral stimulated Brillouin scattering in a chiral photonic crystal fiber. Exploiting the intrinsic preservation of circular polarization in the chiral photonic crystal fiber, left- and right-circularly polarized modes serve as two orthogonal and independent storage channels. Multiple optical data pulses can be selectively or simultaneously stored and retrieved by simply controlling the polarization states of the write-read pulses. The storage time is continuously tunable, and the underlying Brillouin process preserves coherence and channel orthogonality. The result establishes chiral Brillouin scattering as an effective mechanism for spin-channel-multiplexed optoacoustic light storage, providing a robust and scalable platform for multidimensional photonic memories. It also open new opportunities for classic and quantum information processing, reconfigurable quantum networks, and hybrid light-matter interfaces based on coherent acoustic excitations.</description>

      <title>Integrable cascaded frequency conversion using the time rescaling shortcut to adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we explore how full frequency conversion can be performed in shorter, integrable devices by using a STIRAP-like protocol modified by the time rescaling shortcut to adiabaticity. We show how the coupled equations for two simultaneous three-wave mixing processes can be written in terms of a STIRAP-like system, which creates robust conversion, albeit requiring long propagation distances inside a bulk crystal or waveguide. We then discuss how the time rescaling (TR) method can be modified to be applied in optical systems, then apply it in the conversion process to create a TR-STIRAP protocol, showing that full conversion is also obtained, but at a fraction of the propagation distance. We also show how the original shaping of the coupling coefficients required by the TR-STIRAP can be approximated by gaussian functions with high conversion fidelity, thus simplifying the experimental implementation. This protocol has the potential to be used in several areas, including the integration of photon sources and efficient detectors for quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Effective Second-Harmonic Generation Coefficient and C-eigenvalue of Nonlinear Susceptibility Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective second-harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient is a crucial data that quantifies the efficiency of transforming fundamental frequency light into its second harmonic. With the help of the symmetry of nonlinear optical susceptibility tensors, we mainly discuss the computability of such a effective SHG coefficient in uniaxial crystals. For one thing, the calculation of effective SHG coefficient is converted into the optimization models with some geometric constraints by means of the peculiarity of fundamental frequency light. Secondly, the number of variables of such maximum models are cutted in half to $2$ to calculate it easier, and a comparison between the effective SHG coefficient and C-eigenvalue of susceptibility tensor is given also. Finally, some examples of typical crystal classes are presented to verify the correctness and broader applicabilities of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Water immersion single-mirror schlieren imaging system for flow visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schlieren imaging is a popular optical technique for visualizing flow in transparent media. In-water high-sensitivity flow visualization, using schlieren imaging, is usually performed with a large-footprint two-mirror z-configuration. Here, we present a small footprint, easy-to-implement, single-mirror schlieren imaging system for in-water flow visualization. The same system is capable of high-sensitivity flow visualization in air as well. At its core, our system uses a concave mirror with water immersion. We present theoretical analysis and experimental results to show that this water immersion helps reduce the system's footprint by 25%. Our water immersion-based single-mirror schlieren imaging method additionally reduces mirror surface artifacts, increasing the sensitivity of flow visualization. This technique enables a low-cost schlieren system, as demonstrated experimentally using an inexpensive concave mirror. We also provide the experimental validation of high sensitivity in-water flow visualization for some transparent chemicals or solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimized Phase Masks for Absorption of Ultra-Broadband Pulses by Narrowband Atomic Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining genetic algorithm and a spatial light modulator we theoretically analyse how to improve a two-photon cascade absorption in atomic ensembles, inspecting the impact of various configurations and parameters in the optimized phase mask. At low atomic densities, we compare the cases of sequential transitions with the two photons coming from the same pulse or from two different pulses. For the former, we predict an enhancement by a factor of $9.5$, similar to what was previously reported in the literature [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 47 (2002)]. For the later, on the other hand, we obtain an enhancement factor of $26$ times. This absorption of two photons by different pulses is of particular interest for the storage of ultra-broadband single photons by atomic ensembles, in which case the second photon would come from a control pulse. We investigate this process as a function of the atomic density, demonstrating enhancements by factors up to 3 for the two-photon absorption after propagating through large optical depths. However, for the experimental conditions considered in the previous work by Carvalho {et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 101}, 053426 (2020)], in terms of control power and optical depths, we show that this enhancement in two-photon absorption would still result in just a modest increase of the absorption of a weak probe pulse.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Active Polarimetric 3D Imaging for Specular Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D imaging of specular surfaces remains challenging in real-world scenarios, such as in-line inspection or hand-held scanning, requiring fast and accurate measurement of complex geometries. Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals. The proposed method achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in single-shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces.</description>

Abstract: A new generation of microfabricated MEMS for electron optics is changing electron microscopy for the better. These devices allow operations on the electron beam that are impossible with conventional electron optics. Unprecedented phase landscapes like tunable spiral phase plates and localized strong phase gradients are just some examples of what can be achieved. This work establishes the methodological foundation to design and control MEMS based phase plates. The design strategy is rooted on a novel analytical and numerical modeling of thin electrodes with accurate account of the fringing fields having a major role in the thin-MEMS geometry. We designed, fabricated and characterized experimentally a spiral phase plate, and assessed the quality of the generated vortex beam while discussing the most relevant control parameters and design approaches.</description>

Abstract: We construct a scattering matrix with operator valued entries describing solutions to the 1+1 wave equation where permittivities has memory and depends on time and space. It is the analogue of the scattering matrix for spatially localised perturbations where the entries are functions of frequency and appear as Fourier multipliers in solutions of the wave equation. This provides a mathematical explanation of the numerical construction in the recent paper by Horsley et al. The appendix by Zhen Huang and Maciej Zworski presents a numerical scheme for solving the wave equation considered in this article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1011.0862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review optical phenomena associated with the internal energy redistribution which accompany propagation and transformations of monochromatic light fields in homogeneous media. The total energy flow (linear-momentum density, Poynting vector) can be divided into spin part associated with the polarization and orbital part associated with the spatial inhomogeneity. We give general description of the internal flows in the coordinate and momentum (angular spectrum) representations for both nonparaxial and paraxial fields. This enables one to determine local densities and integral values of the spin and orbital angular momenta of the field. We analyse patterns of the internal flows in standard beam models (Gaussian, Laguerre-Gaussian, flat-top beam, etc.), which provide an insightful picture of the energy transport. The emphasize is made to the singular points of the flow fields. We describe the spin-orbit and orbit-orbit interactions in the processes of beam focusing and symmetry breakdown. Finally, we consider how the energy flows manifest themselves in the mechanical action on probing particles and in the transformations of a propagating beam subjected to a transverse perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general formalism to study laser operation in active micro-ring resonators supporting two counterpropagating modes. Our formalism is based on the coupled-mode equations of motion for the field amplitudes in the two counterpropagating modes and a linearized analysis of the small perturbations around the steady state. We show that the devices including an additional S-shaped waveguide establishing an unidirectional coupling between both modes -- the so-called Taiji resonators (TJR) -- feature a preferred chirality on the laser emission and can ultimately lead to unidirectional lasing even in the presence of sizable backscattering. The efficiency of this mode selection process is further reinforced by the Kerr nonlinearity of the material. This stable unidirectional laser operation can be seen as an effective breaking of $\mathcal{T}$-reversal symmetry dynamically induced by the breaking of the $\mathcal{P}$-symmetry of the underlying device geometry. This mechanism appears as a promising building block to ensure non-reciprocal behaviors in integrated photonic networks and topological lasers without the need for magnetic elements.</description>

Abstract: A general algorithm for calculating the reflection and refraction of nonuniform plane waves from an arbitrarily oriented and charged planar interface between two lossy isotropic media is proposed based on the decomposition of the complex wave vector and complex wave numbers with respect to the unit normal vector of the interface. According to the complex vector analysis, the exact definition of the complex angles of incidence, reflection and refraction are presented and applied in the complex forms of Snell's law and Fresnel equations to quickly and correctly calculate the complex wave vectors and the complex electric fields of the reflected and refracted waves at a charged interface where the surface charge densities are considered. Two practical examples are given to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The method may find applications in the fields of remote sensing, light ray-tracing and the interaction of electromagnetic waves with absorbing media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polygon resonators are promising candidates for nanomechanical applications due to their compact architecture and high force sensitivity. Here, we develop an analytical framework to predict the resonance frequencies and dissipation dilution factors $D_Q$ of polygon perimeter modes by extending the Timoshenko-Gere equation to incorporate the tensile stress. The model identifies two dominant dissipation mechanisms: distributed bending in the polygon sides and torsional deformation in the supporting tethers. We reveal that dissipation dilution in these resonators scales as $1/\lambda^2$, distinct from the conventional $1/\lambda$ dependence associated with boundary bending loss. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the torsional loss can be suppressed by tailoring the torsion angle of the supporting tethers. The analytical predictions are validated by finite element simulations, providing a predictive framework for designing high-$Q$ polygon resonators for cavity optomechanics and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Collective light-matter interaction in plasmonic waveguide quantum electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: Rabi oscillations characterize light-matter hybridization in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics~(WQED) framework, with their associated decay rates reflecting excitation damping, yet their behavior remains unresolved when collective emitters are coupled to a collective waveguide mode. This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED.</description>

      <title>Optofluidic light routing via analytically configuring streamlines of micro-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformation optics (TO) is a new method to design metamaterials that can manipulate electromagnetic fields. Inspired by the traditional TO techniques which is mostly based on the solid metamaterials with a limited range of tunability, a novel streamline tracing-based transformation optofluidics (STTOF) method is proposed to manipulate the light path by analytically designating the light-carrying streamlines of the flow in a two-dimensional circular bounded domain. A dipole flow model is built to analytically calculate the streamlines of the flow field inside the domain which allocates the optical/fluidic source and sink pairs at arbitrary positions. Liquid core/liquid cladding (L2) configuration is used in the experiment to trace the light via a specific streamline. Experimental results verify that the light paths agree well with the theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that a good range of tunability can be achieved by adjusting the flow rates and the source-sink positions of optical/fluidic source and sink pairs.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Topographic Temperature: A Maximum-Entropy State Description of Running-In Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface topography governs tribological performance, yet conventional parameters describe either amplitude statistics or spectral content in isolation. We introduce a scale-dependent framework that represents surface height and directional gradient as conjugate coordinates of a structural phase space. The elastic reference energy derived from Persson's contact mechanics theory defines a metric that couples surface geometry to the elastic half-space response. A maximum-entropy formulation yields a canonical state density. In the Gaussian limit this formulation recovers Persson's spectral description exactly, showing that the power spectral density is a complete contact mechanical descriptor only under Gaussian statistics. The associated Lagrange multiplier defines a topographic temperature in the sense of Grmela's multiscale thermodynamics and embeds the areal subsystem within a scale-dependent boundary potential. The framework is validated experimentally using ground and honed AISI 52100 steel discs before and after running in. The ground surface contracts toward lower entropy and elastic energy, whereas the honed surface expands into previously unoccupied states. These opposite trajectories become transparent only in the coupled height-gradient representation and highlight the role of the principal directional gradient for scale-aware surface metrology.</description>

      <title>Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</description>
