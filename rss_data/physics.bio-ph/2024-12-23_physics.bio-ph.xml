      <title>A self-organised liquid reaction container for cellular memory</title>

Abstract: Epigenetic inheritance during cell division is essential for preserving cell identity by stabilizing the overall chromatin organisation.Heterochromatin,the condensed and transcriptionally silent fraction of chromatin,is marked by specific epigenetic modifications that are diluted during each cell division.Here we build a physical model,based on the formation of a biomolecular condensate,a liquid 'droplet',that promotes the restoration of epigenetic marks.Heterochromatin facilitates the droplet formation via polymer-assisted condensation(PAC).The resulting condensate serves as a reaction chamber to reconstruct the lost epigenetic marks.We incorporate the enzymatic reactions into a particle-based simulation and monitor the progress of the epigenetic markers through an in silico analogue of the cell cycle.We demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is robust and stabilizes the heterochromatin domains over many cell generations.This mechanism and variations thereof might be at work for other epigenetic marks as well.</description>

      <title>The geometric nature of homeostatic stress in biological growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphogenesis, the process of growth and shape formation in biological tissues, is driven by complex interactions between mechanical, biochemical, and genetic factors. Traditional models of biological growth often rely on the concept of homeostatic Eshelby stress, which defines an ideal target state for the growing body. Any local deviation from this state triggers growth and remodelling, aimed at restoring balance between mechanical forces and biological adaptation. Despite its relevance in the biomechanical context, the nature of homeostatic stress remains elusive, with its value and spatial distribution often chosen arbitrarily, lacking a clear biological interpretation or understanding of its connection to the lower scales of the tissue. To bring clarity on the nature of homeostatic stress, we shift the focus from Eshelby stress to growth incompatibility, a measure of geometric frustration in the tissue that is the primary source of residual stresses in the developing body. Incompatibility, measured by the Ricci tensor of the growth metric at the continuous level, can be potentially regulated at the cell level through connections with the surrounding cells, making it a more meaningful concept than homeostatic stress. In this geometric perspective, achieving a homeostatic state corresponds to the establishment of a physiological level of frustration in the body, a process leading to the generation and maintenance of the mechanical stresses that are crucial to tissue functionality. In this work we present a formulation of biological growth that penalises deviations from a desired state of incompatibility, similar to the way the Einstein-Hilbert action operates in General Relativity. The proposed framework offers a clear and physically grounded approach that elucidates the regulation of size and shape, while providing a means to link cellular and tissue scales in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Locomotion on a lubricating fluid with spatial viscosity variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied locomotion of a crawler on a thin Newtonian fluid film whose viscosity varied spatially. We first derived a general locomotion velocity formula with fluid viscosity variations via the lubrication theory. For further analysis, the surface of the crawler was described by a combination of transverse and longitudinal travelling waves and we analysed the time-averaged locomotion behaviours under two scenarios: (i) a sharp viscosity interface and (ii) a linear viscosity gradient. Using the asymptotic expansions of small surface deformations and the method of multiple time-scale analysis, we derived an explicit form of the average velocity that captures nonlinear, accumulative interactions between the crawler and the spatially varying environment. (i) In the case of a viscosity interface, the time-averaged speed of the crawler is always slower than that in the uniform viscosity, for both the transverse and longitudinal wave cases. Notably, the speed reduction is most significant when the crawler's front enters a more viscous layer and the crawler's rear exits from the same layer. (ii) In the case of a viscosity gradient, the crawler's speed becomes slower for the transverse wave, while for the longitudinal wave, the corrections are of a higher order compared with the uniform viscosity case. As an application of the derived locomotion velocity formula, we also analysed the impacts of a substrate topography to the average speed. Our analysis illustrates the fundamental importance of interactions between a locomotor and its environment, and separating the time scale behind the locomotion.</description>

      <title>Network-forming phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes forming coacervates in a solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of coacervates through phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs) is critical for understanding biological condensates and developing responsive materials. Traditionally, coacervates are viewed as spherical droplets with growth dynamics resembling liquid-liquid phase separation. However, our fluid particle dynamics simulations incorporating hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions challenge this perspective. Here, we find that oppositely charged PEs form a percolated network even in semi-dilute solutions, coarsening with a unique growth law, $\ell \propto t^{1/2}$. This self-similarity, absent for neutral polymers in poor solvents, arises because PEs in good solvents exhibit weaker, longer-range attractions due to spatial charge inhomogeneity under global charge neutrality. This results in a lower density of the PEs-rich phase and reduced interfacial tension. Increased charge asymmetry further slows network coarsening. Additionally, coacervate droplets initially display irregular shapes due to weak interfacial tension, transitioning slowly to spherical forms. Our research provides new insights into coacervate morphology and coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Digital Phantom for 3D MR Spectroscopy Data Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulated data is increasingly valued by researchers for validating MRS and MRSI processing and analysis algorithms. However, there is no consensus on the optimal approaches for simulation models and parameters. This study introduces a novel 3D MRS digital brain phantom framework, providing a comprehensive and modular foundation for MRS and MRSI data simulation. We generate a digital brain phantom by combining anatomical and tissue label information with metabolite data from the literature. This phantom contains all necessary information for simulating spectral data. We integrate the phantom with a signal-based model to demonstrate its functionality and usability in generating various spectral datasets. Outputs are saved in the NIfTI-MRS format, enabling their use in downstream applications. We successfully implemented and tested the 3D MRS digital brain phantom framework using two different anatomical models at two resolutions. The resulting metabolite maps and spectral datasets demonstrate realistic data quality, flexibility based on user inputs, and reasonable computational efficiency. This innovative 3D digital brain phantom framework provides a clear and structured approach to simulating MRS and MRSI data. Its modular design establishes a strong, adaptable foundation for future advancements in MRS and MRSI simulation, allowing researchers to extend and refine the model to meet the field's evolving needs.</description>

      <title>Spiral waves speed up cell cycle oscillations in the frog cytoplasm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral waves are a well-known phenomenon in excitable media, playing critical roles in biological systems such as cardiac tissues, where they are involved in arrhythmias, and in slime molds, where they guide collective cell migration. However, their presence in the cytoplasm of cells has not been reported to date. In this study, we present the observation of spiral waves in a Xenopus laevis frog egg extract reconstituting periodic cell cycle transitions. We find that the emergence of these spiral waves accelerates the cell division cycle nearly twofold. Using two distinct computational models, we demonstrate that this behavior arises from generic principles and is driven primarily by time-scale separation in the cell cycle oscillator. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between these spiral waves and the more commonly observed target pattern waves in the frog cytoplasm, providing new insights into their dynamic interactions.</description>

      <title>Active morphogenesis of patterned epithelial shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.12820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape transformations of epithelial tissues in three dimensions, which are crucial for embryonic development or in vitro organoid growth, can result from active forces generated within the cytoskeleton of the epithelial cells. How the interplay of local differential tensions with tissue geometry and with external forces results in tissue-scale morphogenesis remains an open question. Here, we describe epithelial sheets as active viscoelastic surfaces and study their deformation under patterned internal tensions and bending moments. In addition to isotropic effects, we take into account nematic alignment in the plane of the tissue, which gives rise to shape-dependent, anisotropic active tensions and bending moments. We present phase diagrams of the mechanical equilibrium shapes of pre-patterned closed shells and explore their dynamical deformations. Our results show that a combination of nematic alignment and gradients in internal tensions and bending moments is sufficient to reproduce basic building blocks of epithelial morphogenesis, including fold formation, budding, neck formation, flattening, and tubulation.</description>

      <title>Spatial structure facilitates evolutionary rescue by drug resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial populations often have complex spatial structures, which can impact their evolution. Here, we study how spatial structure affects the evolution of antibiotic resistance in a bacterial population. We consider a minimal model of spatially structured populations where all demes (i.e., subpopulations) are identical and connected to each other by identical migration rates. We show that spatial structure can facilitate the survival of a bacterial population to antibiotic treatment, starting from a sensitive inoculum. Specifically, the bacterial population can be rescued if antibiotic resistant mutants appear and are present when drug is added, and spatial structure can impact the fate of these mutants and the probability that they are present. Indeed, the probability of fixation of neutral or deleterious mutations providing drug resistance is increased in smaller populations. This promotes local fixation of resistant mutants in the structured population, which facilitates evolutionary rescue by drug resistance in the rare mutation regime. Once the population is rescued by resistance, migrations allow resistant mutants to spread in all demes. Our main result that spatial structure facilitates evolutionary rescue by antibiotic resistance extends to more complex spatial structures, and to the case where there are resistant mutants in the inoculum.</description>

      <title>Bending Elasticity of the reversible Freely Jointed Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The freely jointed chain model with reversible hinges (rFJC) is the simplest theoretical model that captures reversible transitions of the local bending stiffness along the polymer chain backbone, e.g. helix-coil-type of local conformational changes or changes due to the binding/unbinding of ligands). In this work, we analyze the bending fluctuations and the bending response of a grafted rFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. We obtain a recursion relation for the partition function of the grafted rFJC under bending force, which allows, in principle, exact-numerical calculation of the behavior of a rFJC of arbitrary size. In contrast to stretching, we show that under sufficiently stiff conditions, the differential bending compliance and the mean fraction of closed hinges are non-monotonic functions of the force. We also obtain the persistence length $L_p$ of the rFJC, the moments $\langle R^2 \rangle$ (mean-square end-to-end distance), and $\langle z^2 \rangle$ (mean-square transverse deflection) for the discrete chain and take the continuum limit. The tangent vector auto-correlation decays exponentially, as in the wormlike chain model (WLC). Remarkably, the expression of $\langle R^2 \rangle$ as a function of the contour length $L$ becomes the same as that in the WLC. In the thermodynamic limit, we have calculated the exact bending response analytically. As expected, for $L\gg L_p$, the boundary conditions do not matter, and the bending becomes equivalent to stretching. In contrast, for $L_p\gg L$, we have shown the non-monotonicity of the bending response (the compliance and mean fraction of closed hinges).</description>
