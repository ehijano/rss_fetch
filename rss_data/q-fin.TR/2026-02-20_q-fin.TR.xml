      <title>Trading in CEXs and DEXs with Priority Fees and Stochastic Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mixed control framework that combines absolutely continuous controls with impulse interventions subject to stochastic execution delays. The model extends current impulse control formulations by allowing (i) the controller to choose the mean of the stochastic delay of their impulses, and allowing (ii) for multiple pending orders, so that several impulses can be submitted and executed asynchronously at random times. The framework is motivated by an optimal trading problem between centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. In DEXs, traders control the distribution of the execution delay through the priority fee paid, introducing a fundamental trade-off between delays, uncertainty, and costs. We study the optimal trading problem of an agent exploiting trading signals in CEXs and DEXs. From a mathematical perspective, we derive the associated dynamic programming principle of this new class of impulse control problems, and establish the viscosity properties of the corresponding quasi-variational inequalities. From a financial perspective, our model provides insights on how to carry out execution across CEXs and DEXs, highlighting how traders manage latency risk optimally through priority fee selection. We show that employing the optimal priority fee has a significant outperformance over non-strategic fee selection.</description>

      <title>Optimal Portfolio Choice with Cross-Impact Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimal portfolio choice problems in continuous time where the agent's transactions create both transient cross-impact driven by a matrix-valued Volterra propagator, as well as temporary price impact. We formulate this problem as the maximization of a revenue-risk functional, where the agent also exploits available information on a progressively measurable price predicting signal. We solve the maximization problem explicitly in terms of operator resolvents, by reducing the corresponding first order condition to a coupled system of stochastic Fredholm equations of the second kind and deriving its solution. We then give sufficient conditions on the matrix-valued propagator so that the model does not permit price manipulation. We also provide an implementation of the solutions to the optimal portfolio choice problem and to the associated optimal execution problem. Our solutions yield financial insights on the influence of cross-impact on the optimal strategies and its interplay with alpha decays.</description>
