      <title>Time-Resolved Multi-Spectral X-ray Computed Tomography of Cryoprotectant Diffusion Into Biomimetic Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryopreservation via vitrification requires loading cryoprotective cocktails. Insufficient loading may lead to freezing, precluding successful recovery; overloading is toxic. Yet, existing in situ measurements of cryoprotectant permeation remain largely unvalidated and do not resolve individual cryoprotectant concentrations. We introduce multi-spectral X-ray computed tomography (MSCT) to noninvasively quantify the spatiotemporal distribution of cryoprotectants diffusing into a tissue mimicking phantom. A developed photon-energy bin selection algorithm achieves sensitivity to low contrast cryoprotectants without contrast agents or fluorescence edges. The technique is validated with a dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol, and water solution, resolving cryoprotectant volume fractions to within 5% accuracy. We observe heterogeneous diffusion of the cryoprotectants into the tissue mimicking hydrogel, a phenomenon not observable with conventional techniques. MSCT improves upon existing X ray CT methods because it is not underdetermined for multicomponent solutions and does not implicitly assume homogeneous diffusion. These advancements enable the systematic development of cryoprotectant loading protocols and provide diagnostics to assess vitrifiability before cryopreservation.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity 3D multi-slab diffusion MRI using Slab-shifting for Harmonized 3D Acquisition and Reconstruction with Profile Encoding Networks (SHARPEN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) multi-slab imaging is a promising approach for high-resolution in vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) due to its compatibility with short TR (1-2 s), providing optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. A major challenge, however, is slab boundary artifacts arising from non-ideal slab-selective RF excitation. Non-rectangular slab profiles reduce signal intensity at slab boundaries, while profile overlap across adjacent slabs introduces inter-slab crosstalk, where repeated excitation shortens the local TR and limits T1 recovery. To mitigate slab boundary artifacts without increasing scan time, we build on slab profile encoding and propose Slab-shifting for Harmonized 3D Acquisition and Reconstruction with Profile Encoding Networks (SHARPEN). For different diffusion directions, SHARPEN applies inter-volume field-of-view shifts along the slice direction to provide complementary slab profile encoding without prolonging acquisition. Slab profiles are estimated using a lightweight self-supervised neural network that exploits consistency across shifted acquisitions and known physical properties of slab profiles and diffusion images, and corrected images are reconstructed accordingly. SHARPEN was validated using simulated and prospectively acquired high-resolution in vivo data and demonstrates accurate slab profile estimation and robust boundary artifact correction, even in the presence of inter-volume motion. SHARPEN does not require high-quality reference training data and supports subject-specific training. Its efficient GPU-based implementation delivers faster and more accurate correction than NPEN, yielding slice-wise quantitative profiles that closely match those from reference 2D acquisitions. SHARPEN enables high-quality dMRI at 0.7 mm isotropic resolution on a 3T clinical scanner, highlighting its potential to advance submillimeter dMRI for neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>First ex-vivo positronium imaging of tissues with modular J-PET scanner using $^{44}$Sc radionuclide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first ex-vivo positronium imaging of human tissues using the modular J-PET scanner with the $^{44}$Sc radionuclide. The $^{44}$Sc isotope was produced via the $^{44}$Ca(p, n)$^{44}$Sc nuclear reaction and used to perform positronium imaging of phantom composed of human adipose tissue, cardiac myxoma tissue, thrombi blood clot, and also porous polymer XAD4, and a certified reference material (CRM) made from fused silica. The experiment demonstrates the suitability of $^{44}$Sc as a positron source for positronium imaging. The performance of J-PET for positronium imaging with $^{44}$Sc was validated by proper reconstruction of the mean orthopositronium lifetime for CRM material and XAD-4 polymer. The mean ortho-positronium (oPs) lifetimes determined for adipose tissue, cardiac myxoma tissues and thrombi were consistent with results of previous experiments. The study highlights the potential $^{44}$Sc radionuclide for positronium lifetime imaging (PLI).</description>

      <title>The Development of a Preclinical Alpha Irradiation Platform with Versatile Control of Dose, Dose Rate, and Spatiotemporal Irradiation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives. This study develops and validates a vacuum-based alpha irradiation platform to support preclinical radiobiology. We aim to demonstrate precise, independent control over incident energy, fluence rate, and spatiotemporal patterns, which are critical to the mechanisms underlying targeted alpha therapies and low-dose risk assessments.
  Approach. A vacuum-based system with a radioactive alpha source was designed and fabricated. The platform provides independent modulation of: (i) temporal patterns via a programmable gate valve; (ii) fluence rate across two orders of magnitude by varying source-to-aperture distance (57 to 381 mm); (iii) incident energy (0 to 4.6 MeV) using adjustable absorption layers; and (iv) spatial distributions via a 3D motion stage. Temporal precision was assessed via synchronized audio-electronic recordings. Fluence rates and energies were validated using CR-39 detectors and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Spatial precision was verified through programmed continuous and discrete trajectories.
  Main results. Validation experiments demonstrated high system fidelity. Measured irradiation durations deviated from programmed values by less than 0.3 s. Measured and computed fluence rates agreed within 3%. For energy validation, CR-39 track diameters matched MC model predictions within one standard deviation. Recorded spatial patterns and dimensions aligned well with programmed trajectories.
  Significance. We successfully validated a versatile vacuum-based platform that overcomes energy-degradation constraints of gas-filled systems. By providing multi-parametric control over alpha-particle delivery, this system enables systematic investigation into how energy, dose rate, and spatiotemporal patterns influence radiobiological responses. This platform is poised to optimize targeted alpha therapies and refine radiation protection frameworks.</description>

      <title>Test-retest Reliability of Psychophysical Tasks Using Structured Light-Induced Entoptic Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light (SL)-induced polarization perception presents a promising method for the early detection of macular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. We investigated the test-retest reliability of a psychophysical task using SL-based stimuli to induce entoptic patterns in individuals with healthy vision. Twenty-eight participants underwent thorough eye examinations to confirm they had healthy eyes and good vision (logMAR BCVA ~0.00). Of these, 25 participants (n=50 eyes) aged 21 to 75 completed two identical tasks separated by 1 to 14 days. Using SL-based stimuli that produced a rotating entoptic pattern containing 22 azimuthal brushes, we measured the retinal eccentricity threshold $R_T$ at which participants could reliably identify the direction of rotation by varying the size of a central obstruction. This threshold reflects the visual angle of the pattern for each participant. We calculated the reliability coefficient (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) using a two-way mixed-effects model and conducted a Bland-Altman analysis to assess test-retest reliability. The ICC was 0.83 [95% CI: 0.62 - 0.93] for right eyes (RE) and 0.93 [95% CI: 0.84 - 0.97] for left eyes (LE), indicating good reliability. The Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference of -0.32{\deg} (SD: 1.51) and -0.12{\deg} (SD: 1.03) for RE and LE respectively between the first and second sessions, with limits of agreement ranging from -3.28{\deg} to 2.64{\deg} and -2.14{\deg} to 1.89{\deg} for RE and LE respectively, confirming strong agreement and no significant bias. These results demonstrate that SL-based psychophysical tasks are a reliable method for assessing polarization perception, potentially improving screening for diseases affecting macular health.</description>

      <title>An in vivo validation dataset for dynamic volumetric MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic volumetric MRI provides valuable information on in vivo motion and biomechanics, with applications spanning cardiac, musculoskeletal, or pulmonary imaging, amongst others. Developing reconstruction methods for time-resolved volumetric MRI is challenging due to the inherently slow acquisition process of MRI, which makes it an active area of research. However, in vivo validation of these methods remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available datasets with fully sampled ground-truth images. Here, we present a publicly available in vivo dataset designed to facilitate the development and validation of dynamic volumetric MRI reconstruction algorithms. Controlled and repeatable deformations of the muscles in the thigh were induced using a pneumatic pressure cuff, enabling the acquisition of both undersampled dynamic data and fully sampled validation images. The dataset comprises multichannel undersampled k-space data from nine healthy volunteers across four different dynamic deformations, with fully sampled validation data for one deformation. Additionally, an anatomical reference scan and muscle segmentation masks are provided for each subject. To illustrate a possible image reconstruction and validation approach, a binning-based reconstruction was performed on the undersampled data from six dynamic repetitions. The resulting images were consistent with the corresponding fully sampled validation images. This dataset offers possibilities for validating and advancing time-resolved volumetric MRI reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>U-Net Based Image Enhancement for Short-time Muon Scattering Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon Scattering Tomography (MST) is a promising non-invasive inspection technique, yet the practical application of short-time MST is hindered by poor image quality due to limited muon flux. To address this limitation, we propose a U-Net-based framework trained on Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) images reconstructed with simulation MST data to enhance image quality. When applied to experimental MST data, the framework significantly improves image quality, increasing the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) from 0.7232 to 0.9699 and decreasing the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) from 0.3604 to 0.0270. These results demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance low-statistics MST images, thereby paving the way for the practical deployment of short-time MST.</description>

      <title>Photonuclear Production of $^{195m}$Pt for Medical Applications: Cross Sections and Energy Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platinum radioisotopes are of growing interest for targeted cancer therapy and diagnostic imaging because their decay delivers highly localized radiation doses in tissue, herewith enabling precise DNA damage through Auger-electron emission. Developing production technologies that provide platinum isotopes with high specific activity is therefore essential, and photonuclear reactions on stable nuclei offer a viable accelerator-based route when supported by reliable cross-section data. We report photonuclear cross-section measurements for the $^{197}$Au($\gamma$,pn)$^{195m}$Pt reaction at incident $\gamma$-ray energies of 27, 29, and 31~MeV using the activation method. The measurements were performed by irradiating a stack of concentric-ring gold targets with a quasi-monoenergetic $\gamma$-ray beam provided by the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HI$\gamma$S). The induced $^{195m}$Pt activity was quantified using off-line $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. The present results provide the first experimental information in the energy region where the $^{197}$Au($\gamma$,pn)$^{195m}$Pt reaction becomes significant and demonstrate the minimum energy requirements and feasibility of producing $^{195m}$Pt via photonuclear reactions using electron accelerator facilities. These measurements indicate that electron energies of $\ge$ 50 MeV are required to achieve practically meaningful production yields.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the surface mechanical properties of soft tissues mimicking phantoms using impact analyses: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Palpation is the most widely used approach to empirically assess the mechanical properties of superficial tissues. While elastography is used for volume measurements, it remains difficult to assess skin properties with non-invasive methods. This study aimed to compare the performances of an impact-based analysis method (IBAM) consisting in studying the dynamic response of a punch in contact with the tissue with other approaches available on the market.
  Materials and Methods: IBAM consists in analyzing the time dependent force signal induced when a hammer instrumented with a force sensor impacts a cylindrical punch placed in contact with soft tissue. Sensitivities to stiffness changes and to spatial variations were compared between IBAM and four other mechanical surface characterization techniques: IndentoPro (macroindentation), Cutometer (suction), MyotonPro (damped oscillation) and Shore Durometer (durometry) using soft tissue phantoms based on polyurethane gel.  
  Results: For stiffness discrimination in homogeneous phantoms, IBAM was slightly better than IndentoPro and MyotonPro (by 20 % and 35 % respectively), and outperformed the Shore Durometer and Cutometer by a factor of 2 to 4. Furthermore, for stiffness and thickness variations in bilayer phantoms, the axial sensitivity of IBAM was between 2.5 and 4.5 times better than that of MyotonPro and IndentoPro. In addition, the Cutometer appeared to be severely limited by its measurement depth.
  Conclusion: IBAM seems to be a promising technique for characterizing the mechanical properties of soft tissue phantoms at relatively low depth after future ex vivo and in vivo validation studies with biological tissues (with both animal and in human experiments). This work could pave the way to the development of a decision support system in the field of dermatology and cosmetics.</description>

      <title>Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>
