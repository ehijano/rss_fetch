      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate inter-valley coherent states in ABC graphene: collective modes and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments in ABC trilayer graphene detected superconductivity on the border of a phase transition to a symmetry-broken phase. In this work, we use unrestricted Hartree-Fock to study the nature of this phase. We find a close competition between two incommensurate inter-valley coherent (IVC) phases: an IVC crystal where the ordering occurs at multiple wavevectors, and an IVC spiral with a single ordering wavevector. Focusing on one of the regimes where superconductivity is observed experimentally, we find a continuous (or very weakly first order) transition between a half metallic phase to an IVC crystal, followed by a first-order transition into an IVC spiral. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we study the collective mode spectrum in the half-metalic phase. We find a soft inter-valley mode that can mediate superconductivity in a narrow sliver of density near the continuous transition, with a Tc that can reach a few hundreds of mK and a sign-changing s-wave order parameter. The spin stiffness in the half metal phase is found to be surprisingly low, of the order of a few degrees Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo: solution to Majorana sign ambiguity and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), formulated in complex-fermion representation, has played a key role in studying strongly-correlated fermion systems. However, its applicability is limited due to the requirement of particle-number conservation after Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In going beyond the conventional DQMC, one encouraging development occurred when Majorana fermions were introduced for QMC [1,2]. But in previous Majorana-based QMC, Boltzmann weight is determined often with a sign ambiguity. Here we successfully resolved this ambiguity by deriving a closed-form Pfaffian formula for the weight, enabling efficient calculation of the weight with its sign in polynomial time. We call it ''Pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo'' (PfQMC), which can be applied to generic interacting fermion models. We have successfully employed PfQMC to explore how robust Majorana edge modes in Kitaev chain are against strong interactions. By offering greater flexibility, PfQMC can potentially enhance existing sign-mitigating and approximation methods and help address challenging issues such as the ground-state properties of the doped Hubbard model.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the connection between entanglement entropy and quantum metric in topological lattice systems, and provide an elegant and concise proof of this connection. In gapped two-dimensional lattice models with well-defined tight-binding Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement entropy is intimately related to the quantum metric of electronic states.</description>

      <title>Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model at quarter filling: effects of magnetic field and non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay and competition of topology and electron-electron interactions have fascinated researchers since the discovery of topological insulators. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard (SSSHH) model is a prototypical model which includes both non-trivial topology and interactions. Due to its simplicity, there are several artificial quantum systems which can realize such a model to a good approximation. Here we focus on the quarter-filled case, where interactions and dimerization open a charge gap. In particular, we study the single-particle spectral function for the extended SSHH model with magnetic field and explore several parameter limits where effective model descriptions arise. In the strongly-dimerized limit, we show that the low-energy excitations of the spectral function resemble a half-filled Hubbard model with effective dimer sites and renormalized couplings. For strong magnetic field and interactions, we find physics akin to the spinless Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model at half filling, featuring a non-interacting topological phase transition. Moreover, in light of the recent realization of this model in quantum dot simulation, we provide evidence for the stability of the topological phase towards moderate non-local interactions in the experimentally expected parameter range.</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of a universal phase diagram of $k$-local quantum chains subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment, which exhibits "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert space fragmented phases as charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that for any $d$, any state for $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages": local regions across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. We prove that this implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov sectors that each form an exponentially-vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically-disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical states at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement scaling, with rare "inverse quantum many-body scar" states featuring non-area-law scaling. We then numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We also study the critical scaling of the dimensions of various Krylov sectors at $\nu=\nu_c$, as well as investigate the properties of certain special case models for which no phase transitions occur.</description>

      <title>Dipole representation of composite fermions in graphene's quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect has been experimentally observed in the fourth Landau level ($n = 3$). This paper is motivated by recent studies regarding the possibility of pairing and the nature of the ground state in this system. By extending the dipole representation of composite fermions, we adapt this framework to the context of graphene's quantum Hall systems, with a focus on half-filled Landau levels. We derive an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the key symmetry of half-filled Landau levels, particularly particle-hole symmetry. At the Fermi level, the energetic instability of the dipole state is influenced by the interplay between topology and symmetry, driving the system towards a critical state. We explore the possibility that this critical state stabilizes into one of the paired states with well-defined pairing solutions. However, our results demonstrate that the regularized state which satisfies boost invariance at Fermi level and lacks well-defined pairing instabilities emerges as energetically more favorable. Therefore, we find no well-defined pairing instabilities of composite fermions in the dipole representation in the half-filled fourth Landau level ($ n = 3 $) of electrons in graphene. Although the theory of composite fermions has its limitations, further research is required to investigate other possible configurations. We discuss the consistency of our results with experimental and numerical studies, and their relevance for future research efforts.</description>

      <title>Stacking-Dependent Van Hove Singularity Shifts in Three-Dimensional Charge Density Waves of Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium-based kagome systems AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) have emerged as paradigmatic examples exhibiting unconventional charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity linked to van Hove singularities (VHSs). Despite extensive studies, the three-dimensional (3D) nature of CDW states in these systems remains elusive. This study employs first-principles density functional theory and a tight-binding model to investigate the stacking-dependent electronic structures of 3D CDWs in AV$_3$Sb$_5$, emphasizing the significant role of interlayer coupling in behaviors of the VHSs associated with diverse 3D CDW orders. We develop a minimal 3D tight-binding model and present a detailed analysis of band structures and density of states for various 3D CDW stacking configurations, including those with and without a $\pi$-phase shift stacking of the inverse star of David, as well as alternating stacking of the inverse star of David and the star of David. We find that VHSs exist below the Fermi level even in 3D CDWs without $\pi$-phase shift stackings, and that these VHSs shift downward in the $\pi$-phase shift stacking CDW structure, stabilizing the $2\times2\times2$ $\pi$-shifted inverse star of David distortions in alternating vanadium layers as the ground state 3D CDW order of AV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our work provides the electronic origin of 3D CDW orders, paving the way for a deeper understanding of CDWs and superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Itinerant A-type Antiferromagnetic Order in Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the magnetic behavior and resulting transport properties of TaSe$_2$ when intercalated by magnetically active cobalt cations. Acting as the layered host, TaSe$_2$ is a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) that adopts the 2H-polytype. We find through our single crystal and powder diffraction studies that we can prepare the stoichiometry Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$, which crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group $P6_3/mmc$. From magnetic susceptibility and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, we find a transition consistent with antiferromagnetic order below the temperature $T_N$ = 173 K and Co$^{2+}$ in the high-spin state. Neutron powder diffraction and specific heat measurements, however, point to a much smaller than anticipated ordered moment in this sample. From the neutron results, the magnetic structure can be described as an A-type antiferromagnet with an ordered moment size of 1.35(11) $\mu_B$ per Co cation. The direction of the moments are all long the c-axis, which is consistent with the magnetization and susceptibility studies showing this direction to be the easy axis. Interestingly, we find that a weak and subtle ferromagnetic component appears to exist along the $ab$-plane of the Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$ crystals. We place the results of this work in the context of other magnetic-ion intercalated TMDs, especially those of Ta and Nb.</description>

Abstract: Spin-1/2 kagome-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet is theoretically known to have a quantum spin liquid ground state, one of the frontiers of condensed matter physics. The search for the model substances has been continued for a long time, and many candidate substances have been reported. Most of them are hydroxide minerals. Here, I review the static and dynamic properties of non-mineral kagome-lattice antiferromagnets Cs$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$ and Rb$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$.</description>

      <title>Ground State Magnetic Structure and Magnetic Field Effects in the Layered Honeycomb Antiferromagnet YbOCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YbOCl is a representative member of the van der Waals layered honeycomb rare-earth chalcohalide REChX (RE = rare earth, Ch = O, S, Se, and Te, and X = F, Cl, Br, and I) family reported recently. Its spin ground state remains to be explored experimentally. In this paper, we have grown high-quality single crystals of YbOCl and conducted comprehensive thermodynamic, elastic, and inelastic neutron scattering experiments down to 50 mK. The experiments reveal an antiferromagnetic phase below 1.3 K, which is identified as a spin ground state with an intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering. By applying sophisticated numerical techniques to a honeycomb (nearest-neighbor)-triangle (next-nearest-neighbor) model Hamiltonian which accurately describes the highly anisotropic spin system, we are able to well simulate the experiments and determine the diagonal and off-diagonal spin-exchange interactions. The simulations give an antiferromagnetic Kitaev term comparable to the Heisenberg one. The experiments under magnetic fields allow us to establish a magnetic field-temperature phase diagram around the spin ground state. Most interestingly, a relatively small magnetic field (~ 0.3 to 3 T) can significantly suppress the antiferromagnetic order, suggesting an intriguing interplay of the Kitaev interaction and magnetic fields in the spin system. The present study provides fundamental insights into the highly anisotropic spin systems and opens a new window to look into Kitaev spin physics in a rare-earth-based system.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear frequency-asymmetric optical response in chiral systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our theoretical results on the emergence of a nonlinear frequency-asymmetric optical response characteristic of chiral crystal systems with neither spatial inversion symmetry nor mirror symmetry. Based on the group theoretical analysis, we show that the chirality-related second-order nonlinear optical response occurs for two different input frequencies when the low-energy model Hamiltonian includes a time-reversal-even pseudoscalar quantity, i.e., the electric toroidal monopole. We demonstrate its emergence by investigating a fundamental microscopic model with the chiral-type antisymmetric spin--orbit interaction on a simple cubic lattice. By analyzing the behavior of nonlinear optical conductivity based on the Kubo formula, we find that the response is largely enhanced when one of the frequencies is set to zero and the other is set to a resonant frequency. We also discuss the relaxation time dependence of the response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parafermionic representation of cluster chain with $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetry protected topological order is constructed and studied for open and periodic boundary conditions. The resulting Hamiltonian is bilinear in particle operators and splits up into two separate chains composed, respectively, of the standard and time reversal parafermions. It has been demonstrated that each subsystem inherits its own $\mathbb{Z}_p$ component from the symmetry, which corresponds to the parity of all constituent particles. For the open chain, the four invariant parafermions, generating zero-energy modes, are identified. They are located at the edges of each chain. For the closed system with the translational invariance, the boundaries are twisted by the total parafermion parity operator. The structure of edge modes and the space-time symmetry of the system, which depend on the chain length and boundary conditions, are studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Orbital moir\'e and quadrupolar triple-q physics in a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study orders of planer type $(xy,x^2-y^2)$ quadrupoles on a triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor isotropic $J$ and anisotropic $K$ interactions. This type of quadrupoles possesses unique single-ion anisotropy proportional to a third order of the quadrupole moments. This provides an unconventional mechanism of triple-$q$ orders which does not exist for the degrees of freedom with odd parity under time-reversal operation such as magnetic dipoles. In addition to several single-$q$ orders, this system exhibits various orders including incommensurate triple-$q$ quasi-long-range orders and a four-sublattice triple-$q$ partial order. Our Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the phase transition to the latter triple-q state belongs to the universality class of the critical line of the Ashkin-Teller model in two dimensions close to the four-state Potts class. These results indicate a possibility of realizing this unique quadrupole textures in simple triangular systems.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Low-Energy Hamiltonians for Heavy-Fermion Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing a multi-orbital periodic Anderson model with parameters obtained from \textit{ab initio} band structure calculations, combined with degenerate perturbation theory, we derive effective Kondo-Heisenberg and spin Hamiltonians that capture the interaction among the effective magnetic moments. This derivation encompasses fluctuations via both non-magnetic $4f^0$ and magnetic $4f^2$ virtual states, and its accuracy is confirmed through comparison with experimental data obtained from CeIn$_3$. The significant agreement observed between experimental results and theoretical predictions underscores the potential of deriving minimal models from first-principles calculations for achieving a quantitative description of $4f$ materials. Moreover, our microscopic derivation unveils the underlying origin of anisotropy in the exchange interaction between Kramers doublets, shedding light on the conditions under which this anisotropy may be weak compared to the isotropic contribution.</description>

      <title>Shift and Polarization of Excitons from Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite a long history, certain aspects of excitons - the bound inter-band states which form when a valence band hole and a conduction band electron pair - have remained relatively unexplored. This holds particularly true for the wavefunction of an exciton, for which few properties have been explored theoretically in various limiting cases. An intuitive language robustly characterizing the topology of bound electron-hole states is lacking, but needed in order to address the global features of the charge distribution of the excitonic state, to properly understand their transport theory, and to supplement the numerical investigation of excitons in ab-initio approaches. Here, we address these gaps by developing a comprehensive framework for the quantum geometry and topology of two-dimensional exciton states in terms of the exact connections which describe the interaction-renormalized exciton bundle in a periodic lattice. Based on this description, we derive two gauge-invariant quantities, which we identify as the exciton shift vector and the exciton dipole vector. Using the shift vector, we elucidate the topology of exciton bands compared to the topology of the parent electronic band structure, pinpointing precisely how interactions can introduce nontrivial topology to the exciton bands beyond the topology which is contained in the single-particle bands. We further elucidate how shift and polarizations enter into the semiclassical equations of motion for the exciton center of mass coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos makes isolated systems of many interacting particles quickly thermalize and forget about their past. Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos in many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly entangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged weight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and despite the system being fully thermal. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum scarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models, including some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our findings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of chaos in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Twist-Programmable Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative twist angle between layers of near-lattice-matched van der Waals materials is critical for the emergent correlated phenomena associated with moire flat bands. However, the concept of angle rotation control is not exclusive to moir\'e superlattices in which electrons directly experience a twist-angle-dependent periodic potential. Instead, it can also be employed to induce programmable symmetry-breaking perturbations with the goal of stabilizing desired correlated states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate `moireless' twist-tuning of superconductivity together with other correlated orders in Bernal bilayer graphene proximitized by tungsten diselenide. The alignment between the two materials systematically controls the strength of the induced Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC), profoundly altering the phase diagram. As Ising SOC is increased, superconductivity onsets at a higher displacement field and features a higher critical temperature, reaching up to 0.5K. Within the main superconducting dome and in the strong Ising SOC limit, we find an unusual phase transition characterized by a nematic redistribution of holes among trigonally warped Fermi pockets and enhanced resilience to in-plane magnetic fields. The behavior of the superconducting phase is well captured by our theoretical model, which emphasizes the role of interband interactions between Fermi pockets arising due to interaction-enhanced symmetry breaking. Moreover, we identify two additional superconducting regions, one of which descends from an inter-valley coherent normal state and exhibits a Pauli-limit violation ratio exceeding 40, among the highest for all known superconductors. Our results provide new insights into ultra-clean graphene-based superconductors and underscore the potential of utilizing moireless-twist engineering across a range of van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Coulomb interactions in correlated transition-metal perovskite oxides from the constrained random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the strength of electronic correlations of correlated electrons plays important roles in accurately describing the electronic structures and physical properties of transition-metal (TM) perovskite oxides. Here, we study the evolution of electronic interaction parameters as a function of $d$-electron occupancy in an extended class of TM perovskite oxides $AB$O$_3$ ($A$=Sr, Ca, and $B$=3$d$-5$d$ TM elements) using the constrained random-phase-approximation method adopting two distinct models: $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ and $d$-$dp$. For Sr$B$O$_3$ with $B$=Fe, Ru, and Ir, the $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ model faces critical challenges, as the low-energy Hamiltonian spanning $t_{2g}$ manifolds is ill-defined. The $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ model suggests that, for early $AB$O$_3$ series ($B$=$d^1$-$d^3$), the bare Coulomb interaction parameters $V$ remain nearly constant due to the competition between extended $t_{2g}$ Wannier orbitals and bandwidth reduction. As the $d$-electron filling increases, both partially screened Coulomb interaction parameters $U$ and fully screened Coulomb interaction parameters $W$ decrease, which are attributed to enhanced $e_g$-$t_{2g}$ and $e_g$-$p$ screenings. In contrast to the $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ model, the $d$-$dp$ model effectively handles both early and late $AB$O$_3$ perovskites and reveals different trends. Specifically, $V$ varies inversely with the spreads of $d$-orbitals. $W$ reaches its minimum at the $d^3$ occupancy due to an interplay between increasing $d$-orbital localization and increasing screening effects. An unusual trend is observed for $U$, with local maxima at both $d^1$ and $d^4$ occupations. This can be understood from two aspects: (1) the increasing full screening effects from $d^1$ to $d^3$ and (2) the strongest $d$-$d$ and the weakest $d$-$p$ screening effects near $d^4$ for Sr$B$O$_3$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in two-dimensional Hubbard models with an incipient flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One promising way to enhance superconductivity is to have coexisting wide and incipient narrow bands, where the Fermi level intersecting the wide band lies just above the narrow band, by which finite-energy spin fluctuations act as glue to mediate pair scattering. As an extreme case of the narrow band dispersion, we investigate spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in two-dimensional Hubbard models with an incipient flat band. For all of the systems investigated in this study, the Kagome, Lieb, and bilayer square lattices with a flat band, we find that spin-singlet pairing superconductivity is enhanced when the flat band is nearly fully filled, due to the interband pair scattering even when the flat band becomes dispersive by correlation effects. Among these models, enhancement of superconductivity is weak in the Lieb lattice, possibly because the density of states of the wide band goes to zero at the Dirac point where the flat and wide bands intersect. Also, when the electron density is smaller so that the flat band approaches half filling, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and spin-triplet pairing arises, which does not develop strongly compared to the case of the spin-singlet pairing for the incipient band situation.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Symmetry-Protected Signature of 3-body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and characterizing multi-body interactions in quantum processes remains a significant challenge. This is partly because 2-body interactions can produce an arbitrary time evolution, a fundamental fact often called the universality of 2-local gates in the context of quantum computing. However, when an unknown Hamiltonian respects a U(1) symmetry such as charge or particle number conservation, N-body interactions exhibit a distinct symmetry-protected signature known as the N-body phase, which fewer-body interactions cannot mimic. We develop and demonstrate an efficient technique for the detection of 3-body interactions despite the presence of unknown 2-body interactions. This technique, which takes advantage of GHZ states for phase estimation, requires probing the unitary evolution and measuring its determinant in a small subspace that scales linearly with the system size, making it an efficient approach.</description>

      <title>Kagome materials $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K,Rb,Cs): pairing symmetry and pressure-tuning studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vanadium-based kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) host a superconducting ground state that coexists with an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). The CDW state exhibits experimental signatures of chirality, electronic nematicity, and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, raising the questions whether the superconductivity (SC) in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ may also be unconventional, how SC interplays with CDW, and how the two orders evolve upon tuning. This article reviews studies of the superconducting pairing symmetry, and the tuning of SC and CDW in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds. Various experimental techniques consistently find that CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits nodeless SC, which remains robust regardless whether the CDW is present. Under hydrostatic pressure, SC in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ becomes enhanced as the CDW is gradually suppressed, revealing a competition between the two orders. In CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, a new CDW state emerges under pressure that competes more strongly with SC relative to the CDW at ambient pressure, and results in two superconducting domes that coexist with CDW. After the CDW in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ is fully suppressed with hydrostatic pressure, a further increase in pressure leads to a nonmonotonic evolution of the superconducting transition temperature driven by lattice modulations. Thickness is shown to be a powerful tuning parameter in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes, revealing the evolution of CDW and SC upon dimensional reduction, and can be combined with hydrostatic pressure to shed light on the interplay between SC and CDW. Based on results reviewed in this article, we discuss outstanding issues to be addressed in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ systems.</description>

Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

Abstract: We have successfully prepared two novel mixed-valence compounds of silver, Ag(I)Ag(II)F3 and Ag(I)2Ag(II)F4. They may be considered to be long-sought strongly electron-overdoped Ag(II)F2. Their crystal structures indicate that both belong to the Class I (mixed-valence) family with frozen Ag(I) and Ag(II) valences. The measured Raman spectra are well-correlated with the theoretical ones. Density functional theory calculations reveal their smaller fundamental band gaps as compared to pristine AgF2, due to the presence of Ag(I) states in the valence band.</description>

Abstract: By theoretically analyzing the recent temperature dependent transport data in pentalayer graphene [Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203], we establish that the experimentally observed transition from low-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect to higher-temperature fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect is a crossover phenomenon arising from the competition between interaction and disorder energy scales, with the likely zero temperature ground state of the system being either a localized insulator or a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall effect. In particular, the intriguing suppression of FQAHE in favor of QAHE with decreasing temperature is explained as arising from the low-temperature localization of the carriers where disorder overcomes the interaction effects. We provide a detailed analysis of the data in support of the crossover scenario.</description>

Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory of Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons in two-dimensional quantum field theory exhibit patterns of degeneracies and associated selection rules on scattering amplitudes. We develop a representation theory that captures these intriguing features of solitons. This representation theory is based on an algebra we refer to as the "strip algebra", $\textrm{Str}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M})$, which is defined in terms of the non-invertible symmetry, $\mathcal{C},$ a fusion category, and its action on boundary conditions encoded by a module category, $\mathcal{M}$. The strip algebra is a $C^*$-weak Hopf algebra, a fact which can be elegantly deduced by quantizing the three-dimensional Drinfeld center TQFT, $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}),$ on a spatial manifold with corners. These structures imply that the representation category of the strip algebra is also a unitary fusion category which we identify with a dual category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}.$ We present a straightforward method for analyzing these representations in terms of quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are solitons and provide examples demonstrating how the representation theory reproduces known degeneracies and selection rules of soliton scattering. Our analysis provides the general framework for analyzing non-invertible symmetry on manifolds with boundary and applies both to the case of boundaries at infinity, relevant to particle physics, and boundaries at finite distance, relevant in conformal field theory or condensed matter systems.</description>

Abstract: This review is a contribution to a book dedicated to the memory of Michael E. Fisher. The first example of a quantum many body system not expected to have any quasiparticle excitations was the Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory. The absence of quasiparticles can be established in the compressible, metallic state of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of fermions with random interactions. The solvability of the latter model has enabled numerous computations of the non-quasiparticle dynamics of chaotic many-body states, such as those expected to describe quantum black holes. We review thermodynamic properties of the SYK model, and describe how they have led to an understanding of the universal structure of the low energy density of states of charged black holes without low energy supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Static and fluctuating zigzag order, and possible signatures of Kitaev physics, in torque measurements of ${\alpha}$-RuCl${_3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured magnetic torque on a $T_N=7$ K single crystal of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, as a function of the field angle in the $ab$-plane, focusing on temperatures between 2 and 20 K and fields from 0 to 9 T. We find a number of features, many of which can be classified by their angular periodicity. The sample shows an oscillation with a period of 180$^\circ$ (i.e.\ two-fold periodicity) and within the magnetically ordered zigzag phase there is a 60$^\circ$ period (i.e.\ six-fold) sawtooth pattern, which can be explained by reorientation of the zigzag domains as the crystal rotates in the applied field. We argue that the six-fold sawtooth and the two-fold sinusoidal signals arise from distinct regions of the crystal. Suppressing the zigzag order with an applied field above $\sim8$ T at low temperature, a six-fold {\sl sinusoidal} signal remains, suggesting that there is fluctuating zigzag order in the putative field-induced quantum spin liquid state. Finally, in testing theoretical results which predict a torque response with divergent slope across C$_2$-preserving $b$-axes (B1-axis), we find no features like that predicted for Ising topological order. Instead we find features at low temperatures and fields just above the zigzag phase across the non-C$_2$-preserving $b$-axes (B2-axes). Interpretation of this feature is complicated by the development of other similar signatures nearby at slightly lower fields, and by clear enhancement with thermal cycling. Additionally, we contrast the torque response of $T_N \sim$ 7 K and 14 K samples.</description>

      <title>Exact staggered dimer ground state and its stability in a two-dimensional magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding an exact solution for a realistic interacting quantum many-body problem is often challenging. There are only a few problems where an exact solution can be found, usually in a narrow parameter space. Here, we propose a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy and bond depletion for the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions but not for the next-nearest-neighbor interactions. This model has an \emph{exact} and \emph{unique} dimer ground state at $J_2/J_1=1/2$; a dimer state is a product state of spin-singlets on dimers (here, staggered nearest-neighbor bonds). We examine this model by employing the bond-operator mean-field theory and exact diagonalization. These analytical and numerical methods precisely affirm the correctness of the dimer ground state at the exact point ($J_2/J_1=1/2$). As one moves away from the exact point, the dimer order melts and vanishes when the spin gap becomes zero. The mean-field theory with harmonic approximation indicates that the dimer order persists for $-0.35\lesssim J_2/J_1\lesssim 1.35$. However, in non-harmonic approximation, the upper critical point lowers by $0.28$ to $1.07$, but the lower critical point remains intact. The exact diagonalization results suggest that the latter approximation fares better. The model reveals N\'eel order below the lower critical point and stripe magnetic order above the upper critical point. It has a topologically equivalent model on a honeycomb lattice where the nearest-neighbor interactions are still spatial anisotropic, but the bond depletion shifts into the isotropic next-neighbor interactions. Moreover, these models can also be generalized in the three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene II: General Mechanism and a Minimal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal "three-patch model" for the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), a topological electronic state that spontaneously breaks both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translation symmetry. The proposal for this state is inspired by the recently observed integer and fractional quantum Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. There, interaction effects appear to amplify the effects of a weak moir\'e potential, leading to the formation of stable, isolated Chern bands. It has been further shown that Chern bands are stabilized in mean field calculations even without a moir\'e potential, enabling a realization of the AHC state. Our model is built upon the dissection of the Brillouin zone into patches centered around high symmetry points. Within this model, the wavefunctions at high symmetry points fully determine the topology and energetics of the state. We extract two quantum geometrical phases of the non-interacting wavefunctions that control the stability of the topologically nontrivial AHC state. The model predicts that the AHC state wins over the topological trivial Wigner crystal in a wide range of parameters, and agrees very well with the results of full self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations of the rhombohedral multilayer graphene Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculation of observables with three-dimensional projected entangled pair states is generally hard, as it requires a contraction of complex multi-layer tensor networks. We utilize the multi-layer structure of these tensor networks to largely simplify the contraction. The proposed approach involves the usage of the layer structure both to simplify the search for the boundary projected entangled pair states and the single-layer mapping of the final corner transfer matrix renormalization group contraction. We benchmark our results on the cubic lattice Heisenberg model, reaching the bond dimension D = 7, and find a good agreement with the previous results.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Diagram of Rouaite, Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$NO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinon-magnon mixing was recently reported in botallackite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br with a uniaxially compressed triangular lattice of Cu$^{2+}$ quantum spins [Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 037204 (2020)]. Its nitrate counterpart rouaite, Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$NO$_3$, has a highly analogous structure and might be expected to exhibit similar physics. To lay a foundation for research on this material, we clarify rouaite's magnetic phase diagram and identify both low-field phases. The low-temperature magnetic state consists of alternating ferro- and antiferromagnetic chains, as in botallackite, but with additional canting, leading to net moments on all chains which rotate from one chain to another to form a 90$^\circ$ cycloidal pattern. The higher-temperature phase is a helical modulation of this order, wherein the spins rotate from one Cu plane to the next. This extends to zero temperature for fields perpendicular to the chains, leading to a set of low-temperature field-induced phase transitions. Rouaite may offer another platform for spinon-magnon mixing, while our results suggest a delicate balance of interactions and high tunability of the magnetism.</description>

      <title>A method for reconstructing the self-energy from the spectral function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question about the nature of quantum materials such as High-T$_c$ systems remain open to date -- it is unclear whether they are (some variety of) Fermi liquids, or (some variety of) non Fermi liquids. A direct avenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the) self-energy at low energies. Here we present a novel method to extract this low $\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method seems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission data. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the method has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide numerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield distinguishably different low energy self-energies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced triplet superconductivity in next generation ultraclean UTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits numerous signatures of spin-triplet superconductivity -- a rare state of matter which could enable quantum computation protected against decoherence. UTe$_2$ possesses a complex phase landscape comprising two magnetic field-induced superconducting phases, a metamagnetic transition to a field-polarised state, along with pair- and charge-density wave orders. However, contradictory reports between studies performed on UTe$_2$ specimens of varying quality have severely impeded theoretical efforts to understand the microscopic origins of the exotic superconductivity. Here, we report a comprehensive suite of high magnetic field measurements on a new generation of pristine quality UTe$_2$ crystals. Our experiments reveal a significantly revised high magnetic field superconducting phase diagram in the ultraclean limit, showing a pronounced sensitivity of field-induced superconductivity to the presence of crystalline disorder. We employ a Ginzburg-Landau model that excellently captures this acute dependence on sample quality. Our results suggest that in close proximity to a field--induced metamagnetic transition the enhanced role of magnetic fluctuations -- that are strongly suppressed by disorder -- is likely responsible for tuning UTe$_2$ between two distinct spin-triplet superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Persistent Ballistic Entanglement Spreading with Optimal Control in Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement propagation provides a key routine to understand quantum many-body dynamics in and out of equilibrium. The entanglement entropy (EE) usually approaches to a sub-saturation known as the Page value $\tilde{S}_{P} =\tilde{S} - dS$ (with $\tilde{S}$ the maximum of EE and $dS$ the Page correction) in, e.g., the random unitary evolutions. The ballistic spreading of EE usually appears in the early time and will be deviated far before the Page value is reached. In this work, we uncover that the magnetic field that maximizes the EE robustly induces persistent ballistic spreading of entanglement in quantum spin chains. The linear growth of EE is demonstrated to persist till the maximal $\tilde{S}$ (along with a flat entanglement spectrum) is reached. The robustness of ballistic spreading and the enhancement of EE under such an optimal control are demonstrated, considering particularly perturbing the initial state by random pure states (RPS's). These are argued as the results from the endomorphism of the time evolution under such an entanglement-enhancing optimal control for the RPS's.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead non-Clifford fault-tolerant circuits for all non-chiral abelian topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits on a 2-dimensional planar grid of qudits, realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Non-Invertible Symmetries in (1+1)d: Gapped and Gapless Phases, Transitions, and Symmetry TFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fermionic non-invertible symmetries in (1+1)d, which are generalized global symmetries that mix fermion parity symmetry with other invertible and non-invertible internal symmetries. Such symmetries are described by fermionic fusion supercategories, which are fusion $\pi$-supercategories with a choice of fermion parity. The aim of this paper is to flesh out the categorical Landau paradigm for fermionic symmetries. We use the formalism of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study possible gapped and gapless phases for such symmetries, along with possible deformations between these phases, which are organized into a Hasse phase diagram. The phases can be characterized in terms of sets of condensed, confined and deconfined generalized symmetry charges, reminiscent of notions familiar from superconductivity. Many of the gapless phases also serve as phase transitions between gapped phases. The associated fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) can be obtained by performing generalized fermionic Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations on bosonic CFTs describing simpler transitions. The fermionic non-invertible symmetries along with their charges and phases discussed here can be obtained from those of bosonic non-invertible symmetries via fermionization or Jordan-Wigner transformation, which is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Discovered in Niobium Polyhydride at High Pressures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>
