      <title>Enhancing Physics Hand-on Lab through Online Educational Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of digital tools for education offers significant opportunities to enhance teaching practices and student engagement. This study presents a structured categorization of online educational tools based on their core functionalities, including content creation, assessment, classroom management, and collaboration. A pilot implementation of selected tools was conducted in secondary-level science education, followed by a refinement phase to address usability and integration challenges. Feedback from participating teachers and workshop attendees highlighted the importance of accessibility, intuitive interfaces, and support materials. Observations revealed that while multiple tools offer broad functionality, unified platforms may better support effective instruction. The resulting categories and experiences provide practical guidance for educators seeking to integrate digital tools into their teaching in a purposeful and inclusive way.</description>

      <title>AC magnetic measurements with a self-oscillating LC circuit and its application to university education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the magnetic properties of matter plays a key role in materials physics. However, university education on fundamental magnetism is limited to a theoretical survey because of the lack of appropriate apparatus that can be applied for laboratory courses at the undergraduate level. In this work, we introduce an AC magnetometer based on the Colpitts self-oscillator with an inductor coil as a probe. We show that this type of self-oscillator can be adopted in a typical university laboratory course to learn the principles of magnetic measurement and to understand the fundamental magnetism of matter. We demonstrate the exceptional stability of the circuit with a working frequency range of ~10 kHz to 10 MHz and excellent performance to detect the diamagnetic signal from a superconductor at cryogenic temperature.</description>

      <title>QISCIT: A validated concept inventory assessment for quantum information science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17122v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information science (QIS) is a critical interdisciplinary field that requires a well-educated workforce in the near future. Numerous researchers and educators have been actively investigating how to best educate and prepare such a workforce. An open issue has been the lack of a validated tool to asses QIS understanding without requiring college-level math. In this paper, we present the systematic development and content validation of a new assessment instrument called the Quantum Information Science Concept Introductory Test (QISCIT). With feedback from 11 QIS experts, we have developed and validated a 31-item version of QISCIT that covers concepts like quantum states, quantum measurement, qubits, entanglement, coherence and decoherence, quantum gates and computing, and quantum communication. In addition to openly sharing our new concept inventory, we discuss how introductory QIS instructors can use it in their courses.</description>
