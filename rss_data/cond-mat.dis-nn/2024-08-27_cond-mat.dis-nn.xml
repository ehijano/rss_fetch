      <title>Spectral properties, localization transition and multifractal eigenvectors of the Laplacian on heterogeneous networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties and eigenvector statistics of the Laplacian on highly-connected networks with random coupling strengths and a gamma distribution of rescaled degrees. The spectral density, the distribution of the local density of states, the singularity spectrum and the multifractal exponents of this model exhibit a rich behaviour as a function of the first two moments of the coupling strengths and the variance of the rescaled degrees. In the case of random coupling strengths, the spectral density diverges within the bulk of the spectrum when degree fluctuations are strong enough. The emergence of this singular behaviour marks a transition from non-ergodic delocalized states to localized eigenvectors that exhibit pronounced multifractal scaling. For constant coupling strengths, the bulk of the spectrum is characterized by a regular spectral density. In this case, the corresponding eigenvectors display localization properties reminiscent of the critical point of the Anderson localization transition on random graphs.</description>

      <title>Guerra interpolation for place cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyramidal cells that emit spikes when the animal is at specific locations of the environment are known as "place cells": these neurons are thought to provide an internal representation of space via "cognitive maps". Here, we consider the Battaglia-Treves neural network model for cognitive map storage and reconstruction, instantiated with McCulloch &amp; Pitts binary neurons. To quantify the information processing capabilities of these networks, we exploit spin-glass techniques based on Guerra's interpolation: in the low-storage regime (i.e., when the number of stored maps scales sub-linearly with the network size and the order parameters self-average around their means) we obtain an exact phase diagram in the noise vs inhibition strength plane (in agreement with previous findings) by adapting the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE-approach. Conversely, in the high-storage regime, we find that -- for mild inhibition and not too high noise -- memorization and retrieval of an extensive number of spatial maps is indeed possible, since the maximal storage capacity is shown to be strictly positive. These results, holding under the replica-symmetry assumption, are obtained by adapting the standard interpolation based on stochastic stability and are further corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations (and replica-trick outcomes for the sake of completeness). Finally, by relying upon an interpretation in terms of hidden units, in the last part of the work, we adapt the Battaglia-Treves model to cope with more general frameworks, such as bats flying in long tunnels.</description>

      <title>Bounds in partition functions of the continuous random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of continuous random field Ising model (RFIM). Using the distributional zeta-function method, we obtain a series representation for the quenched free energy. It is possible to show that for each moment of the partition function, the multiplet of $k$-fields the Gaussian contribution has one field with the contribution of the disorder and $(k-1)$-fields with the usual propagator. Although the non-gaussian contribution is non-perturbative we are able to show that the model is confined between two $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathcal{O}(k-1)$-symmetric models. Using arguments of lower critical dimension alongside with monotone operators, we show that the phase of the continuous RFIM can be restricted by an $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathcal{O}(k-1) \to \mathcal{O}(k-2)$ phase transition.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization Study on Avalanches in Many-Body Localized Constrained Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avalanche is believed to be the mechanism behind the transition from many-body localization to the thermal phase. We utilize spin chains with constraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization of disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are used to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal bath on long disordered spin chains. In addition to the PXP model, we construct models by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach longer system sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and use these to compare different models. Avalanches are more pronounced in models with constraints compared to those without constraints. Exact diagonalization results are compared with other studies using the master equation. We also identify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>RiD-kit: Software package designed to do enhanced sampling using reinforced dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient method to accelerate the speed of molecular dynamics is a central theme in the field of molecular simulation. One category among the methods are collective-variable-based methods, which rely on predefined collective variables (CVs). The difficulty of selecting a few important CVs hinders the methods to be applied to large systems easily. Here we present a CV-based enhanced sampling method RiD-kit, which could handle a large number of CVs and perform efficient sampling. The method could be applied to various kinds of systems, including biomolecules, chemical reactions and materials. In this protocol, we guide the users through all phases of the RiD-kit workflow, from preparing the input files, setting the simulation parameters and analyzing the results. The RiD-kit workflow provides an efficient and user-friendly command line tool which could submit jobs to various kinds of platforms including the high-performance computers (HPC), cloud server and local machines.</description>

      <title>Emergence of brain function from structure: an algebraic quantum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are governed by the brain's structural organization. Yet, the theoretical principles explaining how the physical architecture of the nervous system shapes its function remain elusive. Here, we combine concepts from quantum statistical mechanics and graph C*-algebras to introduce a theoretical framework where functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the underlying directed network. These equilibrium states, defined from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states formalism (KMS states), quantify the relative contribution of each neuron to the information flow within the connectome. Using the prototypical connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, we provide a comprehensive description of these KMS states, explore their functional implications, and establish the predicted functional network based on the nervous system's anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, we present a model for identifying the potential functional states of a detailed structural connectome and for conceptualizing the structure-function relationship.</description>

      <title>Field theory for optimal signal propagation in ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residual networks have significantly better trainability and thus performance than feed-forward networks at large depth. Introducing skip connections facilitates signal propagation to deeper layers. In addition, previous works found that adding a scaling parameter for the residual branch further improves generalization performance. While they empirically identified a particularly beneficial range of values for this scaling parameter, the associated performance improvement and its universality across network hyperparameters yet need to be understood. For feed-forward networks, finite-size theories have led to important insights with regard to signal propagation and hyperparameter tuning. We here derive a systematic finite-size field theory for residual networks to study signal propagation and its dependence on the scaling for the residual branch. We derive analytical expressions for the response function, a measure for the network's sensitivity to inputs, and show that for deep networks the empirically found values for the scaling parameter lie within the range of maximal sensitivity. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the optimal scaling parameter that depends only weakly on other network hyperparameters, such as the weight variance, thereby explaining its universality across hyperparameters. Overall, this work provides a theoretical framework to study ResNets at finite size.</description>

      <title>Exact numerical solution of the fully-connected classical and quantum Heisenberg spin glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the mean field solution of the quantum and classical Heisenberg spin glasses, using the combination of a high precision numerical solution of the Parisi full replica symmetry breaking equations and a continuous time Quantum Monte Carlo. We characterize the spin glass order and its low-energy excitations down to zero temperature. The Heisenberg spin glass has a rougher energy landscape than its Ising analogue, and exhibits a very slow temperature evolution of its dynamical properties. We extend our analysis to the doped, metallic Heisenberg spin glass, which displays an unexpectedly slow spin dynamics reflecting the proximity to the melting quantum critical point and its associated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Planckian dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between measurement-induced dynamics and conditional unitary evolution in quantum systems. We numerically and analytically investigate commuting random measurement and feedforward (MFF) processes, and find a sharp transition in their ability to generate entanglement negativity as the number of MFF channels varies. We also establish a direct connection between these findings and transitions induced by random dephasing from an environment with broken time-reversal symmetry. In one variant of the problem, we employ free probability theory to rigorously prove the transition's existence. Furthermore, these MFF processes have dynamic circuit representations that can be experimentally explored on current quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and rheological training and memory of nanocolloidal soft glasses under cyclic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An intrinsic feature of disordered and out-of-equilibrium materials, such as glasses, is the dependence of their properties on their history. An important example is rheological memory, in which disordered solids obtain properties based on their mechanical history. Here, we employ x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) with \textit{in situ} rheometry to characterize memory formation in a nanocolloidal soft glass due to cyclic shear. During a cycle, particles undergo irreversible displacements composed of a combination of shear-induced diffusion and strain fields. The magnitudes of these displacements decrease with each cycle before reaching a steady state where the microstructure has become trained to achieve enhanced reversibility. The displacements resemble a random walk in which the directions in each cycle are independent of those in preceding cycles. Accompanying the training is a steady decrease in the dissipation during each cycle towards a steady state value. Memory of this training is revealed by measurements in which the amplitude of the shear is changed after steady state is reached. The magnitude of the particle displacements as well as the dissipation and the change in residual stress vary non-monotonically with the new strain amplitude, having minima near the training amplitude, thereby revealing both microscopic and macroscopic signatures of memory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Dynamics of Alternating Minimization for Bilinear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic dynamics of alternating minimization applied to optimize a bilinear non-convex function with normally distributed covariates. This is achieved by employing the replica method to a multi-temperature glassy system which unfolds the algorithm's time evolution. Our results show that the dynamics can be described effectively by a two-dimensional discrete stochastic process, where each step depends on all previous time steps, revealing the structure of the memory dependence in the evolution of alternating minimization. The theoretical framework developed in this work can be applied to the analysis of various iterative algorithms, extending beyond the scope of alternating minimization.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory suggests, on geometric grounds and with a physically-reasoned assumption that the excluded-volume size of neutrons is 20\% larger than that of protons, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$. This new ``geometric'' random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>

      <title>General theory for extended-range percolation on simple and multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended-range percolation is a robust percolation process that has relevance for quantum communication problems. In extended-range percolation nodes can be trusted or untrusted. Untrusted facilitator nodes are untrusted nodes that can still allow communication between trusted nodes if they lie on a path of distance at most R between two trusted nodes. In extended-range percolation the extended-range giant component (ERGC) includes trusted nodes connected by paths of trusted and untrusted facilitator nodes. Here, based on a message passing algorithm, we develop a general theory of extended-range percolation, valid for arbitrary values of R as long as the networks are locally tree-like. This general framework allows us to investigate the properties of extended-range percolation on interdependent multiplex networks. While the extended-range nature makes multiplex networks more robust, interdependency makes them more fragile. From the interplay between these two effects a rich phase diagram merges including discontinuous phase transitions and reentrant phases. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed exactly solvable model constitutes a fundamental reference for the study of models defined through properties of extended-range paths.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Application of the Two-Electron Quantum Theory of Glass States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The glass state problem stems from the failure described in terms of one-electron theory or atoms (molecules) as independent particles. In 2005, de Gennes proposed that the way to explain the glass transition in simple terms was to construct the cluster model of molecules in contact with all existing glass models and to refine the picture of the mean-field hard-sphere molecules (HSMs) in contact with each other. In the process of refining this picture, we discovered the two-electron quantum theory derived from the second solution of de Gennes n = 0, where the clustered contact of the two HSMs along the z-axis is the sequential emergence of the 16 z-direction interface excited quantum states of their coupled electron pair, the two HSMs suddenly overlap by 0.27% to form a magic-interface two-dimensional vector. The two coupled electron orbitals synchronously escaped the two HSMs 16 times, tangent to the magic interface 16 times, and 16 parallel repulsive electron pairs with an interval of 5.9987{\deg}, which is a clustered boson interaction between the two HSMs. This is the common origin of boson peaks in the glass state and electron pairing in the high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore, the collective behavior of electrons in the two-electron theory can unify the glass transition and the high-temperature superconducting transition. This paper is not only a complete theoretical statement on glass transition, but also a new interpretation of the theory of high-temperature superconductivity, which provides a new theoretical perspective in the search for room-temperature superconducting materials.</description>
