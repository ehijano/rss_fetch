      <title>Uniform $L^2$-estimates for flat nontrivial line bundles on compact complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the uniform $L^2$-estimate of $\bar{\partial}$-equations for flat nontrivial line bundles, proved for compact K\"ahler manifolds in the previous work, to compact complex manifolds. In the proof, by tracing the Dolbeault isomorphism in detail, we derive the desired $L^2$-estimate directly from Ueda's lemma.</description>

      <title>Levi equation and local maximum property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to study the level sets of the solutions of Dirichlet problems for the Levi operator on strongly pseudoconvex domains $\Omega$ in $\mathbb C^2$. Such solutions are generically non smooth, and the geometric properties of their level sets are characterized by means of hulls of their intersections with $b\Omega$, using as main tool the local maximum property introduced by Slodkowski (PJM, 1988). The same techniques are then employed to study the behavior of the complete Levi operator for graphs in $\mathbb C^2$.</description>

      <title>Hankel operators and Projective Hilbert modules on quotients of bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a bounded symmetric domain $\Omega$ with a finite pseudo-reflection group acting on it as a subgroup of the group of automorphisms. This gives rise to quotient domains by means of basic polynomials $\theta$ which by virtue of being proper maps map the \v Silov boundary of $\Omega$ to the \v Silov boundary of $\theta(\Omega)$. Thus, the natural measure on the \v Silov boundary of $\Omega$ can be pushed forward. This gives rise to Hardy spaces on the quotient domain.
  The study of Hankel operators on the Hardy spaces of the quotient domains is introduced. The use of the weak product space shows that an analogue of Hartman's theorem holds for the small Hankel operator. Nehari's theorem fails for the big Hankel operator and this has the consequence that when the domain $\Omega$ is the polydisc $\mathbb D^d$, the {\em Hardy space} is not a projective object in the category of all Hilbert modules over the algebra $\mathcal A (\theta(\mathbb D^d))$ of functions which are holomorphic in the quotient domain and continuous on the closure $\overline {\theta(\mathbb D^d)}$. It is not a projective object in the category of cramped Hilbert modules either. Indeed, no projective object is known in these two categories. On the other hand, every normal Hilbert module over the algebra of continuous functions on the \v Silov boundary, treated as a Hilbert module over the algebra $\mathcal A (\theta(\mathbb D^d))$, is projective.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity-free representations and coisotropic actions of certain nilpotent Lie groups over quasi-symmetric Siegel domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiplicity-free representations of nilpotent Lie groups over a quasi-symmetric Siegel domain, with a focus on certain two-step nilpotent Lie groups. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the multiplicity-freeness property. Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the disjointness of irreducible unitary representations realized over the domain, the multiplicity-freeness of the unitary representation on the space of $L^2$ holomorphic functions, and the coisotropicity of the group action.</description>

      <title>Dimension two holomorphic distributions on four-dimensional projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08901v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional holomorphic distributions on $\mathbb{P}^4$. We classify dimension two distributions, of degree at most $2$, with either locally free tangent sheaf or locally free conormal sheaf and whose singular scheme has pure dimension one. We show that the corresponding sheaves are split. Next, we investigate the geometry of such distributions, studying from maximally non-integrable to integrable distributions. In the maximally non-integrable case, we show that the distribution is either of Lorentzian type or a push-forward by a rational map of the Cartan prolongation of a singular contact structure on a weighted projective 3-fold. We study distributions of dimension two in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose the conormal sheaves are the Horrocks-Mumford sheaves, describing the numerical invariants of their singular schemes which are smooth and connected. Such distributions are maximally non-integrable, uniquely determined by their singular schemes and invariant by a group $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5) \subset Sp(4, \mathbb{Q})$, where $H_5$ is the Heisenberg group of level $5$. We prove that the moduli spaces of Horrocks-Mumford distributions are irreducible quasi-projective varieties and we determine their dimensions. Finally, we observe that the space of codimension one distributions, of degree $d\geq 6$, on $\mathbb{P}^4$ have a family of degenerated flat holomorphic Riemannian metrics. Moreover, the degeneracy divisors of such metrics consist of codimension one distributions invariant by $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5)$ and singular along a degenerate abelian surface with $(1,5)$-polarization and level-$5$-structure.</description>

      <title>Explicit Solutions in Isotropic Planar Elastostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing the intricate challenges in plane elasticity, especially with non-vanishing traction and complex geometries, requires innovative methods. This paper offers a novel approach, drawing inspiration from the Neumann problem for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann problem. Our method caters to domains that are conformally equivalent to a unit disk or annulus and emphasizes deriving explicit solutions for the displacement field rather than the stress tensor, differentiating it from most traditional methods. We explore solutions for specific traditional cases to demonstrate its efficacy, such as a cardioid domain, a ring domain with a shifted hole, and a gear-like structure. This work augments the existing toolbox for researchers and practitioners addressing isotropic planar elastostatics challenges, presenting a unified and flexible approach.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Witten instanton complexes on stratified pseudomanifolds with K\"ahler wedge metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Witten instanton complexes for K\"ahler Hamiltonian Morse functions on stratified pseudomanifolds with wedge K\"ahler metrics satisfying a local conformally totally geodesic condition. We use this to extend Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities for the $L^2$ cohomology of Dolbeault complexes, deriving versions for Poincar\'e Hodge polynomials, the spin Dirac and signature complexes for which we prove rigidity results, in particular establishing the rigidity of $L^2$ de Rham cohomology for these circle actions. We study formulas for Rarita Schwinger operators, generalize formulas studied by Witten and Gibbons-Hawking for the equivariant signature and extend formulas used to compute NUT charges of gravitational instantons. We discuss conjectural inequalities extending known Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch formulas for other cohomology theories including those of Baum-Fulton-Quart. This article contains the first extension of Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities and instanton complexes to singular spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized complex Stein manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a generalized complex (GC) Stein manifold and provide complete characterizations in three fundamental aspects. First, we extend Cartan's Theorem A and B within the framework of GC geometry. Next, we define $L$-plurisubharmonic functions and develop an associated $L^2$ theory. This leads to a characterization of GC Stein manifolds using $L$-plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions. Finally, we establish the existence of a proper GH embedding from any GC Stein manifold into $\mathbb{R}^{2n-2k} \times \mathbb{C}^{2k+1}$, where $2n$ and $k$ denote the dimension and type of the GC Stein manifold, respectively. This provides a characterization of GC Stein manifolds via GH embeddings. Several examples of GC Stein manifolds are given.</description>
