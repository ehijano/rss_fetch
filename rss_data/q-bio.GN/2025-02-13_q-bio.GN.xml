      <title>Origin of $\alpha$-satellite repeat arrays from mitochondrial molecular fossils -- sequential insertion, expansion, and evolution in the nuclear genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alpha satellite DNA is large tandem arrays of 150-400 bp units, and its origin remains an evolutionary mystery. In this research, we identified 1,545 alpha-satellite-like (SatL) repeat units in the nuclear genome of jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Among them, thirty-nine copies of SatL were organized in two palindromic arrays in mitochondria, resulting in a 50% increase in the genome size. Strikingly, genomic neighborhood analyses of 1,516 nuclear SatL repeats revealed that they are located in NuMT (nuclear mitochondrial DNA) regions, and SatL phylogeny matched perfectly with mitochondrial genes and NuMT pseudogenes. These results support that SatL arrays originated from ten independent mitochondria insertion events into the nuclear genome within the last 500,000 years, after divergence from its sister species N. giraulti. Dramatic repeat GC-percent elevation (from 33.9% to 50.4%) is a hallmark of rapid SatL sequence evolution in mitochondria due to GC-biased gene conversion facilitated by the palindromic sequence pairing of the two mitochondrial SatL arrays. The nuclear SatL repeat arrays underwent substantial copy number expansion, from 12-15 (SatL1) to over 400 copies (SatL4). The oldest SatL4B array consists of four types of repeat units derived from deletions in the AT-rich region of ancestral repeats, and complex high-order structures have evolved through duplications. We also discovered similar repeat insertions into the nuclear genome of Muscidifurax, suggesting this mechanism can be common in insects. This is the first report of the mitochondrial origin of nuclear satellite sequences, and our findings shed new light on the origin and evolution of satellite DNA.</description>

      <title>Variational Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, impulse responses, human faces) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to construct one's outcome under a counterfactual treatment, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its observed factual outcome on top of the covariates. We propose a deep variational Bayesian framework that rigorously integrates two main sources of information for outcome construction under a counterfactual treatment: one source is the individual features embedded in the high-dimensional factual outcome; the other source is the response distribution of similar subjects (subjects with the same covariates) that factually received this treatment of interest.</description>

      <title>Predicting Cellular Responses with Variational Causal Inference and Refined Relational Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the responses of a cell under perturbations may bring important benefits to drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. In this work, we propose a novel graph variational Bayesian causal inference framework to predict a cell's gene expressions under counterfactual perturbations (perturbations that this cell did not factually receive), leveraging information representing biological knowledge in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to aid individualized cellular response predictions. Aiming at a data-adaptive GRN, we also developed an adjacency matrix updating technique for graph convolutional networks and used it to refine GRNs during pre-training, which generated more insights on gene relations and enhanced model performance. Additionally, we propose a robust estimator within our framework for the asymptotically efficient estimation of marginal perturbation effect, which is yet to be carried out in previous works. With extensive experiments, we exhibited the advantage of our approach over state-of-the-art deep learning models for individual response prediction.</description>
