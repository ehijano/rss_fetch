      <title>Chiral Soft Algebras for $\mathcal{N} = 2$ Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some time ago, Seiberg and Witten solved for moduli spaces of vacua parameterized by scalar vacuum expectation values in $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories. More recently, new vacua associated to soft theorems and asymptotic symmetries have been found. This paper takes some first steps towards a complete picture of the infrared geometry of $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory incorporating both of these infrared structures.</description>

      <title>APD-Invariant Tensor Networks from Matrix Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple connection between matrix quantum mechanics and tensor networks. This allows us to imbue tensor networks with some interesting additional structure. The geometry of the graph describing the tensor network state is determined dynamically, giving a notion of background independence. The tensor network states have a $U(N)$ invariance, which (a) allows us to consider continuous families of entanglement cuts even with a finite number of tensors and (b) includes a notion of bulk coordinate reparameterization and area-preserving diffeomorphism invariance in the large N limit. These tensor networks also have a natural scale of nonlocality that behaves similarly to a string scale, suggesting a potential toy model for sub-AdS physics. Emergent $U(p)$ gauge fields naturally appear on the tensor network links.</description>

      <title>Fully stabilized Minkowski vacua in the $2^6$ Landau-Ginzburg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moduli stabilization via fluxes in the $2^6$ Landau-Ginzburg model. Fluxes not only give masses to scalar fields but can also induce higher order couplings that stabilize massless fields. We investigate this for several different flux choices in the $2^6$ model and find two examples that are inconsistent with the Refined Tadpole Conjecture. We also present, to our knowledge, the first 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Minkowski solution in string theory without any flat direction.</description>

      <title>Tadpole conjecture in non-geometric backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calabi-Yau compactifications have typically a large number of complex structure and/or K\"ahler moduli that have to be stabilised in phenomenologically-relevant vacua. The former can in principle be done by fluxes in type IIB solutions. However, the tadpole conjecture proposes that the number of stabilised moduli can at most grow linearly with the tadpole charge of the fluxes required for stabilisation. We scrutinise this conjecture in the $2^6$ Gepner model: a non-geometric background mirror dual to a rigid Calabi-Yau manifold, in the deep interior of moduli space. By constructing an extensive set of supersymmetric Minkowski flux solutions, we spectacularly confirm the linear growth, while achieving a slightly higher ratio of stabilised moduli to flux charge than the conjectured upper bound. As a byproduct, we obtain for the first time a set of solutions within the tadpole bound where all complex structure moduli are massive. Since the $2^6$ model has no K\"ahler moduli, these show that the massless Minkowski conjecture does not hold beyond supergravity.</description>

      <title>A New Covariant Entropy Bound from Cauchy Slice Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin an investigation of a new holographic covariant entropy bound (HCEB) in gravity. This bound arises from Cauchy slice holography, a recently proposed duality between the bulk gravity theory and a `boundary' theory that lives on Cauchy slices. The HCEB is the logarithm of the maximum number of states of this theory that can pass through a given cut $\sigma$ of a Cauchy slice $\Sigma$ ($\sigma$ is thus a codimension-2 surface in the bulk). We show that the bound depends only on the codimension-2 data on $\sigma$, and is thus independent of the choice of slice $\Sigma$. For classical states, the HCEB upper bounds the entanglement between two subregions of the boundary of $\Sigma$.
  We calculate the bound explicitly in pure three-dimensional GR with negative cosmological constant, where the Cauchy slice theory is the $T \overline{T}$-deformation of the dual CFT. We find that the imaginary energy eigenstates in the spectrum of the deformed theory play a crucial role for obtaining a valid bound in Lorentzian signature. Our bound agrees with the area of a surface at certain marginal and extremal surfaces, but differs elsewhere. In particular, it exceeds the area by an arbitrarily large amount for (anti)trapped surfaces, such as those that lie inside a black hole. Finally, we discuss how these results can be used to write down tensor networks corresponding to arbitrary Cauchy slices.</description>

      <title>On (A)dS Solutions from Scherk-Schwarz Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of dS vacua in supersymmetry-breaking Scherk-Schwarz toroidal compactifications of type II string theory, using the well-understood ingredients of curvature, fluxes and 1-loop Casimir energy. Starting from the 10d equations, we derive a series of no-go theorems and existence conditions for dS, and present two explicit, fully-backreacted, solutions: a dS one, which turns out to be not under control, and an AdS one, which can be chosen at arbitrarily weak coupling and large volume by dialling the unbounded fluxes. We then use a lower-dimensional EFT description to show that any dS solution has a universal tachyon and no parametric control. The simplest AdS solutions are also perturbatively unstable. We extend the no-go theorems to slow-roll acceleration and test various swampland conjectures in our non-supersymmetric string setup. The question of numerically controlled, unstable dS is left open.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons-Like Formulation of Exotic Massive 3D Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Chern-Simons-like formulation of exotic general massive gravity models within the framework of third-way to three-dimensional gravity. We classify our construction into two main approaches: one using torsional cosmological Einstein and exotic massive gravity equations, and the other a torsion-free approach. The former approach, while mathematically appealing, precludes the construction of critical exotic models where the central charges vanish. In contrast, the latter approach has a wider parameter space and allows for the construction of critical models. An explicit example of an exotic general model is provided to illustrate both methods. Our methodology represents the first step towards establishing the most general Chern-Simons-like formulation of third-way to three-dimensional gravity, which would enable the study of identifying its bulk/boundary unitary sector.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of the flat space sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a deformation of the flat space symmetric space sigma model action. The deformed action is designed to allow a Lax connection for the equations of motion, similar to the undeformed model. For this to work, we identify a set of constraints that the deformation operator, which is incorporated into the action, must fulfil. After defining the deformation, we explore simple solutions to these constraints and describe the resulting deformed backgrounds. Specifically, we find flat space in Cartesian coordinates with arbitrary constant $H$-flux or linear $H$-flux in a light cone coordinate. Additionally, we find the Nappi-Witten background along with various Nappi-Witten-like backgrounds with near arbitrary constant $H$-flux. Finally, we discuss the symmetries of the deformed models, finding that the deformed symmetries will always include a set of symmetries that in the undeformed limit becomes the total set of translations.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at both infinite and finite temperature, aligning with results from spectral statistics and OTOCs. Our findings offer a new diagnostic tool for quantum chaos that is operator-independent, potentially leading to more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of general properties in quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Coupled Sine-Gordon and $\phi^4$ System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling the fields may lead to the emergence of new phenomena. In the realm of classical fields and nonlinear systems, extensive research has been conducted on their solitary and soliton solutions. In the conducted studies, typically two $\phi^4$ systems, or two sine-Gordon systems, have been coupled. The sine-Gordon system exhibits diverse solutions, all well-behaved, with its soliton solutions fully understood. On the other hand, the $\phi^4$ system, which is significant in field theory, has solitary solutions, but these solutions are not solitonic. For example, from a pair of kink and antikink, we cannot construct a bound state; or that after a collision, these two solutions do not revert to their initial status and become disrupted. In this study, we couple a $\phi^4$ system with a sine-Gordon system to impart stability from the sine-Gordon system to the $\phi^4$ system. We have demonstrated that for a coupled $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon system, this expectation is somewhat met.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions of higher-spin supercurrents in 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT: general formalism for arbitrary superspins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the general structure of the three-point functions involving conserved higher-spin ``vector-like" supercurrents $J_{s}(z) := J_{\alpha(s) \dot{\alpha}(s)}(z)$ in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theory. Using the constraints of superconformal symmetry and superfield conservation equations, we utilise a computational approach to analyse the general structure of the three-point function $\langle J^{}_{s_{1}}(z_{1}) \, J'_{s_{2}}(z_{2}) \, J''_{s_{3}}(z_{3}) \rangle$ and provide a general classification of the results. We demonstrate that the three-point function is fixed up to $2 \min (s_{i}) + 2$ independent conserved structures, which we propose to hold for arbitrary superspins. In addition, we show that the conserved structures can be classified as parity-even or parity-odd in superspace based on their transformation properties under superinversion.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic doublets in CCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of logarithmic CFT doublets in the soft sector of celestial CFT related with supertranslations. We show that the quantum operator associated with a $\log u$ late-time behavior for the asymptotic gravitational shear forms a logarithmic CFT pair of conformal dimension $\Delta=1$ with an IR-regulated supertranslation Goldstone current. We discuss this result in connection with previous encounters of log CFT structures in the IR-finite part of celestial OPEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a class of Feynman Integrals containing hidden regions that are not straightforwardly identified using the geometric, or Newton polytope, approach to the method of regions. Using Landau singularity analysis and existing analytic results, we study the appearance of such regions in wide-angle and forward scattering and discuss how they can be exposed in both the momentum and parametric representations. We demonstrate that in the strict on-shell limit such integrals contain Landau singularities that prevent their direct numerical evaluation in parameter space and describe how they can be re-parameterised and dissected to circumvent this problem.</description>

      <title>Twisted Riemann bilinear relations and Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the framework of twisted cohomology, we study twisted Riemann bilinear relations (TRBRs) satisfied by multi-loop Feynman integrals and their cuts in dimensional regularisation. After showing how to associate to a given family of Feynman integrals a period matrix whose entries are cuts, we investigate the TRBRs satisfied by this period matrix, its dual and the intersection matrices for twisted cycles and co-cycles. For maximal cuts, the non-relative framework is applicable, and the period matrix and its dual are related in a simple manner. We then find that the TRBRs give rise to quadratic relations that generalise quadratic relations that have previously appeared in the literature. However, we find that the TRBRs do not allow us to obtain quadratic relations for non-maximal cuts or completely uncut Feynman integrals. This can be traced back to the fact that the TRBRs are not quadratic in the period matrix, but separately linear in the period matrix and its dual, and the two are not simply related in the case of a relative cohomology theory, which is required for non-maximal cuts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents comprehensive examples of $\mathfrak{osp}(\mathcal{N}|2)$ Chern$\,-\,$Simons supergravity on $AdS_3$ for $\mathcal{N}&gt;2$. These formulations, which include the most general boundary conditions, represent extensions of previously discovered works $(\textit{Ozer and Filiz$,$Eur Phys J C 82(5):472, 2022})$ for $\mathcal{N}&lt;3$. In our work, we show that under the loosest set of boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebras consist of two copies of the $\mathfrak{osp}(3|2)_k$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)_k$ algebras. We subsequently restrict the gauge fields upon the boundary conditions to achieve supersymmetric extensions of the Brown$\,-\,$Henneaux boundary conditions. Based on these results, we finally find that the asymptotic symmetry algebras are two copies of the $\mathcal{N}=3$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebras for $\mathcal{N}=(3,3)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(4,4)$ extended higher$\,-\,$spin supergravity theory in $AdS_3$.</description>

      <title>Hayward spacetime with axion scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a static spherically symmetric system in which Einstein gravity is minimally coupled with a self-interacting complex scalar field and a nonlinear electromagnetic field, referred to as Hayward axion stars. Employing numerical methods, we find that it essentially describes axion stars with the magnetic charge. In the absence of magnetic charge and with only the scalar field present, the system reduces to axion stars. We discover that when the magnetic charge $q$ exceeds a critical value, extreme solutions with frequencies $\omega$ approaching zero can be found and the critical horizon emerges. Within this horizon, the scalar field and energy density are highly concentrated and decrease precipitously at its boundary. The time component of the metric function approaches zero within this region, indicating that gravity is extremely intense, and time nearly ceases to flow. To an observer at infinity, the star appears to be frozen, hence we refer to these extreme solutions exhibiting a critical horizon as Hayward axion frozen stars. Furthermore, it is important to note that as $\omega \rightarrow 0$, the mass of the Hayward axion frozen star becomes independent of the decay constant and is only determined by the magnetic charge. Additionally, we find that the frozen star solutions possess two light rings. With an increase in the magnetic charge, these light rings move outward, while changes in the decay constant have little effect on their positions.</description>

Abstract: We find new $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ dualities through the twisted compactifications of 4d supersymmetric theories on $S^2$. Our findings include dualities for both $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ non-Abelian gauge theories, as well as $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Gauge/Landau-Ginzburg duality.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Harvesting Vacuum Entanglement in Cosmic String Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the entanglement generation in a pair of qubits that experience the vacuum fluctuations of a scalar field in the Cosmic String spacetime. The qubits are modeled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. We introduce a Heisenberg $XY$-interaction between the qubits that enhances the generation of quantum correlations. It is supposed that the qubits begin at a general mixed state described by a density operator with no entanglement while the field stays at its vacuum state. In this way, we find the general properties and conditions to create entanglement between the qubits by exploiting the field vacuum fluctuations. We quantify the qubits entanglement using the Negativity measure based on the Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion. We find that the Cosmic String would increase the entanglement harvesting when both qubits are near the Cosmic String. When the qubits locations are far from the Cosmic String we recover the usual results for Minkowski space. The Heisenberg $XY$-interaction enhance the entanglement harvesting irrespective of the coupling nature (ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic). When the qubits are far apart from each other we find a maximum entanglement harvesting at the resonance points between the Heisenberg coupling constant and the qubits energy gap.</description>

Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic quantum many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Asymptotically Hot and Dense QCD Matter: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the ``modified'' $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated with collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <title>Phantom black holes and wormholes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study Einstein-bumblebee gravity theory minimally coupled with external matter -- a phantom/non-phantom(conventional) scalar field, find that these scalar fields can affect the black hole solutions, i.e., giving a hair to a black hole. In this model, the contents of the scalar field and the forms of its potential are completely determined by the black hole spacetime. The constant bumblebee field $b_\mu$ affects a spacetime via the coupling constant $\ell$ and its motion equations. If $\ell&gt;-1$, the phantom field is admissible and the conventional scalar field is forbidden; if $\ell&lt;-1$, the phantom field is forbidden and the conventional scalar field is admissible. When the bumblebee potential is quadratic, we obtain a wormhole solution asymptotically to Ellis wormhole, it can be called Ellis-bumblebee-phantom (EPB) wormhole which is regular everywhere and has no singularity. An Schwarzschild-like wormhole with naked singularity and an asymptotic flat phantom black hole solutions are also obtained. When the bumblebee potential is linear, we derive a phantom (anti-)de-Sitter (dS/AdS) black hole solution which can be asymptotic to Schwarzschild dS/AdS black hole. The phantom potential and the Lagrange-multiplier $\lambda$ behave as a cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we review in detail different mechanisms of generation of large primordial fluctuations and their implications for the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced secondary gravity waves (SIGW), with the ultimate aim of understanding the impact of loop correction on quantum correlations and the power spectrum. To accomplish the goal, we provide a concise, comprehensive, but in depth review of conceptual and technical details of the standard model of the universe, namely, causal structure and inflation, quantization of primordial perturbations and field theoretic techniques such as "in-in" formalism needed for the estimation of loop correction to the power spectrum. We discuss at length the severe constraints (no-go) on PBH production in single-field inflation imposed by appropriately renormalized quantum loop corrections, computed while maintaining the validity of the perturbation framework and assuming sufficient inflation to address the causality problem. Thereafter, we discuss in detail the efforts to circumvent the no-go result in Galileon inflation, multiple sharp transition (MST)-induced inflation, and stochastic single field inflation using an effective field theoretic (EFT) framework applicable to a variety of models. We provide a thorough analysis of the Dynamical Renormalization Group (DRG) resummation approach, adiabatic and late-time renormalization schemes, and their use in producing solar and sub-solar mass PBHs. Additionally, we give a summary of how scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are produced in MST setups and Galileon inflation.Finally, the PBH overproduction issue is thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact and asymptotic dissipative spectral form factor for elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF) has recently emerged as a diagnostic tool for assessing non-integrability or chaos in non-Hermitian systems. It extends the concept of the spectral form factor (SFF), a widely used measure for similar investigations in Hermitian systems. In this study, we concentrate on the elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble (eGinUE), which interpolates between the non-Hermitian limit of Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) and the Hermitian limit of Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by varying a symmetry parameter. We derive exact finite-dimension expression and large-dimension approximation for the DSFF of eGinUE. A key finding of this work is a compelling ``scaling relationship" between the DSFF of eGinUE and that of the GUE or GinUE. This scaling relationship also reveals a previously unobserved connection between the DSFF of GinUE and the SFF of GUE. The DSFF for eGinUE displays a \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure in the GinUE and GUE limits, as well as in the crossover region, with differences in time scales that are well-explained by the aforementioned scaling relationship. Additionally, depending on the symmetry regime within the crossover, we provide various estimates for the Thouless time ($T_\mathrm{Th}$) and Heisenberg time ($T_\mathrm{H}$), which correspond to the dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transitions, respectively. Our analytical results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations of the eGinUE random matrix model, showing excellent agreement.</description>

Abstract: We investigate high and low energy implications of a gauge dual description of the Standard Model. The high energy electric theory features gauge dynamics involving only fermionic matter fields, while the low energy magnetic description features a quasi-supersymmetric spectrum testable at colliders. The flavour theory is constructed via operators generated at the Planck scale. We further show that duality opens novel avenues for theories of grand unification.</description>

      <title>A soft-hard framework with exact four momentum conservation for small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new framework, called x-scape, for the combined study of both hard and soft transverse momentum sectors in high energy proton-proton ($p$-$p$) and proton-nucleus ($p$-$A$) collisions is set up. A dynamical initial state is set up using the 3d-Glauber model with transverse locations of hotspots within each incoming nucleon. A hard scattering that emanates from two colliding hotspots is carried out using the Pythia generator. Initial state radiation from the incoming hard partons is carried out in a new module called I-matter, which includes the longitudinal location of initial splits. The energy-momentum of both the initial hard partons and their associated beam remnants is removed from the hot spots, depleting the energy-momentum available for the formation of the bulk medium. Outgoing showers are simulated using the matter generator, and results are presented for both cases, allowing for and not allowing for energy loss. First comparisons between this hard-soft model and single inclusive hadron and jet data from $p$-$p$ and minimum bias $p$-$Pb$ collisions are presented. Single hadron spectra in $p$-$p$ are used to carry out a limited (in number of parameters) Bayesian calibration of the model. Fair comparisons with data are indicative of the utility of this new framework. Theoretical studies of the correlation between jet $p_T$ and event activity at mid and forward rapidity are carried out.</description>

Abstract: We show that there are four chiral ${\cal W}$-algebra extensions of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ algebra and construct them explicitly. We do this by a simple identification of each of the inequivalent embeddings of a copy of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,{\mathbb R})$ in the $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ algebra and the maximal subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ that commutes with it. Then using the standard 2d chiral CFT techniques we find the corresponding ${\cal W}$-algebra extensions. Two of the four resultant ${\cal W}$-algebras are new, one of which may be thought of as the conformal $\mathfrak{bms}_3$ algebra valid for finite values of its central charge.}</description>

      <title>A Fermi Model of Quantum Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum model of the Schwarzschild black hole as a quantum mechanics of a system of fermionic degrees of freedom. The system has a constant density of states and a Fermi energy that is inversely proportional to the size of the system. Assuming equivalence principle, we show that the degeneracy pressure of the Fermi degrees of freedom is able to withstand the collapse of gravity if the radius of the system is given precisely by the horizon radius of the Schwarzschild black hole. In our model, the fermionic degrees of freedom at each energy level can be entangled in certain different ways, giving rise to a multitude of degenerate ground states of the system. The counting of these microstates reproduces precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This simple Fermi model is universal and works also for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om charged black hole as well as black hole with a cosmological constant. From the properties of the Fermi variables, we propose that quantum gravity is characterized by a principle of {\it maximal capacity of states} where there can be no more than $V /l_P^3$ quantum states in any volume $V$. It implies a loss of spatial locality below the Planck length and suggests that any singularity predicted by general relativity is resolved and replaced by a quantum space in quantum gravity. In our model, a black hole spacetime is equipped with an uniform distribution of energy levels. This is another reason why black hole can be considered a simple harmonic oscillator of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Unconventional conformal invariance of maximal depth partially massless fields on $dS_{4}$ and its relation to complex partially massless SUSY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10060v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deser and Waldron have shown that maximal depth partially massless theories of higher integer spin on 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_{4}$) possess infinitesimal symmetries generated by the conformal Killing vectors of $dS_{4}$. However, it was later shown by Barnich, Bekaert, and Grigoriev that these theories are not invariant under the conformal algebra $so(4,2)$. To get some insight into these seemingly contradicting results we write down the full set of infinitesimal transformations generated by the 15 conformal Killing vectors of $dS_{4}$. Although the infinitesimal transformations generated by the 10 dS Killing vectors are known, the transformations generated by the 5 non-Killing conformal Killing vectors were absent from the literature, and we show that they have an `unconventional' form. In the spin-2 case, we show that the field equations and the action are invariant under the unconventional conformal transformations. For spin $s &gt;2$, the invariance is demonstrated only at the level of the field equations. For all spins $s \geq 2$, we reproduce the result that the symmetry algebra does not close on $so(4,2)$. This is due to the appearance of higher-derivative symmetries in the commutator of two unconventional conformal transformations. Our results concerning the closure of the full algebra are inconclusive. Then we shift focus to the question of supersymmetry (SUSY) on $dS_{4}$ and our objective is twofold. First, we uncover a non-interacting supermultiplet that consists of a complex partially massless spin-2 field and a complex spin-3/2 field on $dS_{4}$. Second, we showcase the appearance of the unconventional conformal symmetries in the commutator of two SUSY transformations. Thus, this commutator closes on an algebra that is neither $so(4,1)$ nor $so(4,2)$, while its full structure is an open question. More open questions arising from our findings are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Expansion of hypergeometric functions in terms of polylogarithms with nontrivial variable change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of one and many variables play an important role in various branches of modern physics and mathematics. Often we have hypergeometric functions with indices linear dependent on a small parameter with respect to which one needs to perform Laurent expansions. Moreover such expansions are desirable to be expressed in terms of well known functions which can be evaluated with arbitrary precision. To solve this problem we use the differential equation method and the reduction of corresponding differential systems to canonical basis. Specifically we will be interested in the generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable together with Appell and Lauricella functions and their expansions in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. Particular attention will be given to the case of rational indices of considered hypergeometric functions when the reduction to canonical basis involves nontrivial variable change. The article comes with a Mathematica package Diogenes, which provides algorithmic implementation of the required steps.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Thresholds for the S-matrix of Unstable Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the analytic properties of S-matrix for unstable particles, which is defined as the residues on the unphysical sheets where unstable poles reside. We demonstrate that anomalous thresholds associated with UV physics are unavoidable for unstable particles. This is in contrast to stable particles, where the anomalous thresholds are due to IR physics, set by the scale of the external kinematics. As a result, any dispersive representation for the amplitude will involve contributions from these thresholds that are not computable from the IR theory, and thus invalidate the general positivity bound. Indeed using toy models, we explicitly demonstrate that the four-derivative couplings for unstable particles can become negative, violating positivity bounds even for non-gravitational theories. Along the way, we show that contributions from anomalous thresholds in a given channel can be captured by the double discontinuity of that channel.</description>

      <title>Comments on Integrability in the Symmetric Orbifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a map between the excitation of the symmetric-product orbifold CFT of $T^4$, and of the worldsheet-integrability description of $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ of Lloyd, Ohlsson Sax, Sfondrini, and Stefa\'nski at $k=1$. We discuss the map in the absence of RR fluxes, when the theory is free, and at small RR flux, $h\ll 1$, where the symmetric-orbifold CFT is deformed by a marginal operator from the twist-two sector. We discuss the recent results of Gaberdiel, Gopakumar, and Nairz, who computed from the perturbed symmetric-product orbifold the central extension to the symmetry algebra of the theory and its coproduct. We show that it coincides with the $h\ll 1$ expansion of the lightcone symmetry algebra known from worldsheet integrability, and that hence the S matrix found by Gaberdiel, Gopakumar, and Nairz maps to the one bootstrapped by the worldsheet integrability approach.</description>

      <title>Generalized Dualities for Heterotic and Type I Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define generalized dualities for heterotic and type I strings based on consistent truncations to half-maximal gauged supergravities in more than three dimensions. The latter are constructed from a generalized Scherk-Schwarz ansatz in heterotic double field theory that satisfies the strong constraint. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the resulting embedding tensor are discussed, showing that only certain gaugings, called geometric, can arise from this procedure. For all of them, we explicitly construct the internal geometry and gauge potentials. In general, this construction is not unique and permits different uplifts which are used to define generalized T-duality. Two examples are worked out underlying the utility of our approach to explore new dualities and uplifts of half-maximal gauged supergravities.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of all orders for Arnol'd cat map lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l&gt;2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</description>

      <title>When left and right disagree: Entropy and von Neumann algebras in quantum gravity with general AlAdS boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean path integrals for UV-completions of $d$-dimensional bulk quantum gravity were studied in [1] by assuming that they satisfy axioms of finiteness, reality, continuity, reflection-positivity, and factorization. Sectors ${\cal H}_{\cal B}$ of the resulting Hilbert space were defined for any $(d-2)$-dimensional surface ${\cal B}$, where ${\cal B}$ may be thought of as the boundary $\partial\Sigma$ of a bulk Cauchy surface in a corresponding Lorentzian description, and where ${\cal B}$ includes the specification of boundary conditions for bulk fields. Cases where ${\cal B}$ was the disjoint union $B\sqcup B$ of two identical $(d-2)$-dimensional surfaces were studied in detail and, after the inclusion of finite-dimensional `hidden sectors,' were shown to provide a Hilbert space interpretation of the associated Ryu-Takayanagi entropy. The analysis was performed by constructing type-I von Neumann algebras $\mathcal A_L^B,\mathcal A_R^B$ that act respectively at the left and right copy of $B$ in $B\sqcup B$.
  Below, we consider the case of general ${\cal B} = B_L\sqcup B_R$ with $B_L,B_R$ distinct. For any $B_R$, we find that the von Neumann algebra at $B_L$ acting on ${\cal H}_{B_L\sqcup B_R}$ is a central projection of the corresponding type-I von Neumann algebra on the `diagonal' Hilbert space ${\cal H}_{B_L\sqcup B_L}$. As a result, the von Neumann algebras $\mathcal A_L^{B_L},\mathcal A_R^{B_L}$ defined in [1] using the diagonal Hilbert space coincide precisely with those defined using the full Hilbert space of the theory. A second implication is that, for any ${\cal H}_{B_L\sqcup B_R}$, including the same hidden sectors as in the diagonal case again provides a Hilbert space interpretation of the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy. We also show the above central projections to satisfy consistency conditions that lead to a universal central algebra relevant to all choices of $B_L,B_R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we find a neutral complex scalar field dynamics in a $2+1$ dimensional black hole background which can provide a scheme for studying the pattern formation process in $1+1$ dimensional reaction-diffusion systems. The patterns include plane wave, defect turbulence, phase turbulence, spatio-temporal intermittency where defect chaos coexists with stable plane wave, and coherent structures. A phase diagram is obtained by studying the linear instability of the plane wave solutions to determine the onset of the holographic version of the BFN instability. Near the critical temperature the holographic model is dual to the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), which has been studied extensively in reaction-diffusion systems. While at low temperature the holographic theory is different from CGLE.</description>

      <title>Multiboundary wormholes and OPE statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive higher moments in the statistical distribution of OPE coefficients in holographic 2D CFTs, and show that such moments correspond to multiboundary Euclidean wormholes in pure 3D gravity. The n-th cyclic non-Gaussian contraction of heavy-heavy-light OPE coefficients follows from crossing symmetry of the thermal n-point function. We derive universal expressions for the cubic and quartic moments and demonstrate that their scaling with the microcanonical entropy agrees with a generalization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Motivated by this result, we conjecture that the full statistical ensemble of OPE data is fixed by three premises: typicality, crossing symmetry and modular invariance. Together, these properties give predictions for non-factorizing observables, such as the generalized spectral form factor. Using the Virasoro TQFT, we match these connected averages to new on-shell wormhole topologies with multiple boundary components. Lastly, we study and clarify examples where the statistics of heavy operators are not universal and depend on the light operator spectrum. We give a gravitational interpretation to these corrections in terms of Wilson loops winding around non-trivial cycles in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

Abstract: We investigate vortex partition functions defined from integrals over the handsaw quiver varieties of type $A_{1}$ via wall-crossing phenomena. We consider vortex partition functions defined by two types of cohomology classes, and get functional equations for each of them. We also give explicit formula for these partition functions. This gives proofs to formula suggested by physicsts. In particular, we obtain geometric interpretation of formulas for multiple hypergeometric functions including rational limit of the Kajihara transformation formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental nature of Dark Matter is a central theme of the Snowmass 2021 process, extending across all frontiers. In the last decade, advances in detector technology, analysis techniques and theoretical modeling have enabled a new generation of experiments and searches while broadening the types of candidates we can pursue. Over the next decade, there is great potential for discoveries that would transform our understanding of dark matter. In the following, we outline a road map for discovery developed in collaboration among the frontiers. A strong portfolio of experiments that delves deep, searches wide, and harnesses the complementarity between techniques is key to tackling this complicated problem, requiring expertise, results, and planning from all Frontiers of the Snowmass 2021 process.</description>

      <title>Little Rip, Pseudo Rip and bounce cosmology with generalized equation of state in non-standard backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of universe's late-time acceleration and dark energy has overseen a great deal of research into cosmological singularities and particularly future singularities. Perhaps the most extreme of such singlarities is the big rip, which has propelled a lot of work into ways of moderating it or seeking out alternatives to it and two such alternatives to the big rip are the Little rip and Pseudo rip. Another possibility to consider the far future of the universe is through bounce cosmologies, which presents its own interesting ideas. So in this work we investigate the Little rip, Pseudo rip and Bounce cosmology in non-standard cosmological backgrounds with a generalized equation of state in the presence of a viscous fluid. In particular we discuss about Chern-Simons cosmology and the RS-II Braneworld and discuss how the exotic and non-conventional nature of gravity in such cosmologies affect universal evolution in these scenarios. We find out that there are very significant differences in the behaviour of such cosmic scenarios in these universes in comparison to how they appear in the simple general relativistic universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the negativity of the moment of inertia of (quark-)gluon plasma in a window of "supervortical" range of temperatures above the deconfining phase transition, $T \simeq (1\dots 1.5) T_c $ found recently in numerical Monte Carlo simulations by two independent methods. In our work, we confirm numerically that the origin of this effect is rooted in the thermal evaporation of the non-perturbative chromomagnetic condensate. We argue that the negative moment of inertia of gluon plasma indicates the presence of a novel effect, the negative spin-vortical coupling for gluons resulting in a negative gluonic Barnett effect: the spin polarization of gluons exceeds the total angular momentum of rotating plasma, thus forcing the orbital angular momentum to take negative values in the supervortical range of temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the first twenty moments of three convergent quartic bi-tracial 2-matrix ensembles in the large $N$ limit. These ensembles are toy models for Euclidean quantum gravity originally proposed by John Barrett and collaborators. A perturbative solution is found for the first twenty moments using the Schwinger-Dyson equations and properties of certain bi-colored unstable maps associated to the model. We then apply a result of Guionnet et al. to show that the perturbative and convergent solution coincide for a small neighbourhood of the coupling constants. For each model we compute an explicit expression for the free energy, critical points, and critical exponents in the large $N$ limit. In particular, the string susceptibility is found to be $\gamma =1/2$, hinting that the associated universality class of the model is the continuous random tree.</description>

      <title>The Unruh-DeWitt model and its joint interacting Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we make the connection between the Unruh-DeWitt particle detector model applied to quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and the rigorous construction of the spin-boson model. With some modifications, we show that existing results about the existence of a spin-boson ground state can be adapted to the Unruh-DeWitt model. In the most relevant scenario involving massless scalar fields in (3+1)-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes, where the Unruh-DeWitt model describes a simplified model of light-matter interaction, we argue that common choices of the spacetime smearing functions regulate the ultraviolet behaviour of the model but can still exhibit infrared divergences. In particular, this implies the well-known expectation that the joint interacting Hilbert space of the model cannot be described by the tensor product of a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space and the Fock space of the vacuum representation. We discuss the conditions under which this problem does not arise and the relevance of the operator-algebraic approach for better understanding of particle detector models and their applications. Our work clarifies the connection between obstructions due to Haag's theorem and infrared bosons in the spin-boson models, and paves the way for more rigorous study of entanglement and communication in the UDW framework involving multiple detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and their excitation beyond general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of black holes to small perturbations is known to be partially described by a superposition of quasinormal modes. Despite their importance to enable strong-field tests of gravity, little to nothing is known about what overtones and quasinormal-mode amplitudes are like for black holes in extensions to general relativity. We take a first step in this direction and study what is arguably the simplest model that allows first-principle calculations to be made: a nonrotating black hole in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with cubic-in-curvature terms. Using a phase-amplitude scheme that uses analytical continuation and the Pr\"ufer transformation, we compute, for the first time, the quasinormal overtone frequencies (in this theory) and quasinormal-mode excitation factors (in any theory beyond general relativity). We find that the overtone quasinormal frequencies and their excitation factors are more sensitive than the fundamental mode to the lengthscale $l$ introduced by the higher-derivative terms in the effective field theory. We argue that a description of all overtones cannot be made within the regime of validity of the effective field theory, and we conjecture that this is a general feature of any extension to general relativity that introduces a new lengthscale. We also find that a parametrization of the modifications to the general-relativistic quasinormal frequencies in terms of the ratio between $l$ and the black hole's mass is somewhat inadequate, and we propose a better alternative. As an application, we perform a preliminary study of the implications of the breakdown, in the effective field theory, of the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated to metric perturbations of polar and axial parity of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity. We also present a simple justification for the loss of isospectrality.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Displacement versus velocity memory effects from a gravitational plane wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article demonstrates that additionally to the well-known velocity memory effect, a vacuum gravitational plane wave can also induce a displacement memory on a couple of test particles. A complete classification of the conditions under which a velocity or a displacement memory effect occur is established. These conditions depend both the initial conditions of the relative motion and on the wave profile. The two cases where the wave admits a pulse or a step profile are treated. Our analytical expressions are then compared to numerical integrations to exhibit either a velocity or a displacement memory, in the case of these two families of profiles. Additionally to this classification, the existence of a new symmetry of polarized vacuum gravitational plane wave under M\"{o}bius reparametrization of the null time is demonstrated. Finally, we discuss the resolution of the geodesic deviation equation by means of the underlying symmetries of vacuum gravitational plane wave.</description>

      <title>Radiative symmetry breaking from the on-shell perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models with classical scale symmetry, which feature radiative symmetry breaking, generically lead to a supercooled first-order phase transition in the early Universe resulting in a strong gravitational-wave signal, potentially observable by LISA. This is thanks to the absence of mass terms in the potential and the resulting logarithmic structure of the zero-temperature effective potential. It is known that imposing a symmetry at classical level does not prohibit breaking it by quantum corrections. In the case of scale symmetry, a mass term can in principle appear through renormalisation. This is not the case in the commonly used $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ or Coleman-Weinberg schemes. In this work, we renormalise a scale-invariant model in the on-shell scheme to check whether parameterising it with the physical masses will introduce mass terms to the potential. We find that indeed mass terms appear for an arbitrary choice of the physical masses. However, we formulate an on-shell condition for radiative symmetry breaking, sufficient and necessary for the cancellation of mass terms in the renormalised potential, yielding a logarithmic potential needed for supercooled phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis in modified Galileon cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the phase space analysis in modified Galileon cosmology, where the Galileon term is considered a coupled scalar field, $F(\phi)$. We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\phi)$ and the three well-motivated potential functions $V(\phi)$. We obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and cosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe different phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found the scaling solution for critical points, which determine different evolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points show stable behavior and indicate the Universe's late-time cosmic acceleration phase. Further, the results are examined with the cosmological data sets of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ and the Supernovae Ia.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This could be tested via second-order GW signals in future observatories, for instance, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET. %. for sneutrino mass $m_{\phi} \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $\beta \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>
