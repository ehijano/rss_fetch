      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Weighted Answer-set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logic programs, more specifically, Answer-set programs, can be annotated with probabilities on facts to express uncertainty. We address the problem of propagating weight annotations on facts (eg probabilities) of an ASP to its standard models, and from there to events (defined as sets of atoms) in a dataset over the program's domain. We propose a novel approach which is algebraic in the sense that it relies on an equivalence relation over the set of events. Uncertainty is then described as polynomial expressions over variables. We propagate the weight function in the space of models and events, rather than doing so within the syntax of the program. As evidence that our approach is sound, we show that certain facts behave as expected. Our approach allows us to investigate weight annotated programs and to determine how suitable a given one is for modeling a given dataset containing events.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Semantics for Jumping Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11849v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jumping automata are finite automata that read their input in a non-sequential manner, by allowing a reading head to ``jump'' between positions on the input, consuming a permutation of the input word. We argue that allowing the head to jump should incur some cost. To this end, we propose four quantitative semantics for jumping automata, whereby the jumps of the head in an accepting run define the cost of the run. The four semantics correspond to different interpretations of jumps: the absolute distance semantics counts the distance the head jumps, the maximum jump semantics counts the maximal distance the head jumps in a single step, the reversal semantics counts the number of times the head changes direction, and the Hamming distance measures the number of letter-swaps the run makes.
  We study these measures, with the main focus being the boundedness problem: given a jumping automaton, decide whether its (quantitative) languages is bounded by some given number $k$. We establish the decidability and complexity for this problem under several variants.</description>

      <title>Elgot Categories and Abacus Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Elgot categories, a sort of distributive monoidal category with additional structure in which the partial recursive functions are representable. Moreover, we construct an initial Elgot category, the morphisms of which coincide with a lightly modified version of Lambek's abacus programs. The partial functions that are strongly representable in this initial Elgot category are precisely the partial recursive ones.</description>

      <title>Empirical Measures and Strong Laws of Large Numbers in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem is a uniform version of the strong law of large numbers. It states that for every IID sequence of random variables, the empirical measure converges to the underlying distribution (in the sense of uniform convergence of the CDF). In this work, we provide tools to study such limits of empirical measures in categorical probability.
  We propose two axioms, permutation invariance and empirical adequacy, that a morphism of type $X^\mathbb{N} \to X$ should satisfy to be interpretable as taking an infinite sequence as input and producing a sample from its empirical measure as output. Since not all sequences have a well-defined empirical measure, ``such empirical sampling morphisms'' live in quasi-Markov categories, which, unlike Markov categories, allow partial morphisms. Given an empirical sampling morphism and a few other properties, we prove representability as well as abstract versions of the de Finetti theorem, the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem and the strong law of large numbers.
  We provide several concrete constructions of empirical sampling morphisms as partially defined Markov kernels on standard Borel spaces. Instantiating our abstract results then recovers the standard Glivenko-Cantelli theorem and the strong law of large numbers for random variables with finite first moment. Our work thus provides a joint proof of these two theorems in conjunction with the de Finetti theorem from first principles.</description>

      <title>From conceptualization to operationalized meaning via ontological components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontologies enable knowledge sharing and interdisciplinary collaboration by providing standardized, structured vocabularies for diverse communities. While logical axioms are a cornerstone of ontology design, natural language elements such as annotations are equally critical for conveying intended meaning and ensuring consistent term usage. This paper explores how meaning is represented in ontologies and how it can be effectively represented and communicated, addressing challenges such as indeterminacy of reference and meaning holism. To this end, it proposes an approach founded on the use of a new structure, named 'ontological component' and defined by: a term-centered design; enhanced characterization of both formal and natural language statements; an operationalizable definition of communicated meaning based on general assertions; and the integration of natural language elements into the logical theory. By formalizing the meaning of ontological components, this work seeks to enhance the semantic robustness of terms, improving their clarity and accessibility across domains. Furthermore, it aims to address practical challenges in applied ontologies, such as facilitating reuse and managing versioning, thereby strengthening their role in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>The commutativity problem for effective varieties of formal series, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formal series in noncommuting variables $\Sigma$ over the rationals is a mapping $\Sigma^* \to \mathbb Q$. We say that a series is commutative if the value in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input. The commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite presentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it is commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has not been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.
  We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that constitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's varieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series, introduced by Sch\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective (pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.
  In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of formal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata, shuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these models recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their commutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it remarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such disparate computation models.
  Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of formal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power series for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential equations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks to this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive sequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are effective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.</description>

      <title>The Size-Change Principle for Mixed Inductive and Coinductive types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows how to use Lee, Jones and Ben Amram's size-change principle to check correctness of arbitrary recursive definitions in an ML / Haskell like programming language with inductive and coinductive types.Naively using the size-change principle to check productivity and termination is straightforward but unsound when inductive and coinductive types are nested. We can however adapt the size-change principle to check ``totality'', which corresponds exactly to correctness with respect to the corresponding (co)inductive type.</description>

      <title>Guarded Negation Transitive Closure Logic is 2-EXPTIME-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider guarded negation transitive closure logic (GNTC). In this paper, we show that the satisfiability problem for GNTC is in 2-EXPTIME (hence, 2-EXPTIME-complete from existing lower bound results), which improves the previously known non-elementary time upper bound. This extends previously known 2-EXPTIME upper bound results, e.g., for the guarded negation fragment of first-order logic, the unary negation fragment of first-order logic with regular path expressions, propositional dynamic logic (PDL) with intersection and converse, and CPDL+ (an extension of PDL with conjunctive queries) of bounded treewidth. To this end, we present a sound and complete local model checker on tree decompositions. This system has a closure property of size single exponential, and it induces a reduction from the satisfiability problem for GNTC into the non-emptiness problem for 2-way (weak) alternating parity tree automata in single exponential time. Additionally, we investigate the complexity of satisfiability and model checking for fragments of GNTC, such as guarded (quantification) fragments, unary negation fragments, and existential positive fragments.</description>

      <title>A Logic for Reasoning About Aggregate-Combine Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a modal logic in which counting modalities appear in linear inequalities. We show that each formula can be transformed into an equivalent graph neural network (GNN). We also show that a broad class of GNNs can be transformed efficiently into a formula, thus significantly improving upon the literature about the logical expressiveness of GNNs. We also show that the satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete. These results bring together the promise of using standard logical methods for reasoning about GNNs and their properties, particularly in applications such as GNN querying, equivalence checking, etc. We prove that such natural problems can be solved in polynomial space.</description>

      <title>On the formalization of the notion of a concurrent algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous papers give accounts of quests for satisfactory formalizations of the classical informal notion of an algorithm and the contemporary informal notion of an interactive algoritm. In this paper, an attempt is made to generalize the results of the former quest to the contemporary informal notion of a concurrent algorithm. The notion of a concurrent proto-algorithm is introduced. The thought is that concurrent algorithms are equivalence classes of concurrent proto-algorithms under an appropriate equivalence relation. Three equivalence relations are defined. Two of them are deemed to be bounds for an appropriate equivalence relation and the third is likely an appropriate one. The connection between concurrency and non-determinism in the presented setting is also addressed.</description>

      <title>The structure of rough sets defined by reflexive relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For several types of information relations, the induced rough sets system RS does not form a lattice but only a partially ordered set. However, by studying its Dedekind-MacNeille completion DM(RS), one may reveal new important properties of rough set structures. Building upon D. Umadevi's work on describing joins and meets in DM(RS), we previously investigated pseudo-Kleene algebras defined on DM(RS) for reflexive relations. This paper delves deeper into the order-theoretic properties of DM(RS) in the context of reflexive relations. We describe the completely join-irreducible elements of DM(RS) and characterize when DM(RS) is a spatial completely distributive lattice. We show that even in the case of a non-transitive reflexive relation, DM(RS) can form a Nelson algebra, a property generally associated with quasiorders. We introduce a novel concept, the core of a relational neighborhood, and use it to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for DM(RS) to determine a Nelson algebra.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of DAI: A Logic-Based Approach to Stablecoin Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies. Despite their growing prominence, many stablecoins have struggled to consistently meet stability expectations, and their underlying mechanisms often remain opaque and challenging to analyze. This paper focuses on the DAI stablecoin, which combines crypto-collateralization and algorithmic mechanisms. We propose a formal logic-based framework for representing the policies and operations of DAI, implemented in Prolog and released as open-source software. Our framework enables detailed analysis and simulation of DAI's stability mechanisms, providing a foundation for understanding its robustness and identifying potential vulnerabilities.</description>
