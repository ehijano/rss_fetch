      <title>VQ-DSC-R: Robust Vector Quantized-Enabled Digital Semantic Communication With OFDM Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital mapping of semantic features is essential for achieving interoperability between semantic communication and practical digital infrastructure. However, current research efforts predominantly concentrate on analog semantic communication with simplified channel models. To bridge these gaps, we develop a robust vector quantized-enabled digital semantic communication (VQ-DSC-R) system built upon orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. Our work encompasses the framework design of VQ-DSC-R, followed by a comprehensive optimization study. Firstly, we design a Swin Transformer-based backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, integrated with VQ modules that map the features into a shared semantic quantized codebook (SQC) for efficient index transmission. Secondly, we propose a differentiable vector quantization with adaptive noise-variance (ANDVQ) scheme to mitigate quantization errors in SQC, which dynamically adjusts the quantization process using K-nearest neighbor statistics, while exponential moving average mechanism stabilizes SQC training. Thirdly, for robust index transmission over multipath fading channel and noise, we develop a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to refine channel state information, and design an attention-based module to dynamically adapt to channel noise. The entire VQ-DSC-R system is optimized via a three-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority of VQ-DSC-R over benchmark schemes, achieving high compression ratios and robust performance in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>GRAM-DIFF: Gram Matrix Guided Diffusion for MIMO Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose GRAM-DIFF, a Gram-matrix-guided diffusion framework for semi-blind multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel estimation. Recent diffusion-based estimators leverage learned generative priors to improve pilot-based channel estimation; but they do not exploit second-order structural information estimated from data symbols. In practical systems, the channel Gram matrix can be estimated from received symbols and it provides realization-level information about channel subspace structure. The proposed method integrates a pre-trained angular-domain diffusion prior with two complementary guidance mechanisms: a novel Gram-matrix guidance term that enforces second-order consistency during the reverse diffusion process, and likelihood guidance from pilot observations. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-matched initialization and adaptive guidance scaling ensure stability and low inference latency. Simulations on 3GPP and QuaDRiGa channel models demonstrate consistent normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) improvements over deterministic diffusion baselines, achieving 4 to 6 dB SNR gains at an NMSE of 0.1 over the baseline in Fest et al. (2024). The framework exhibits graceful degradation under coherence-time constraints, smoothly reverting to likelihood-guided diffusion when data-based Gram estimates become unreliable.</description>

      <title>On the Entropy of General Mixture Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture distributions are a workhorse model for multimodal data in information theory, signal processing, and machine learning. Yet even when each component density is simple, the differential entropy of the mixture is notoriously hard to compute because the mixture couples a logarithm with a sum. This paper develops a deterministic, closed-form toolkit for bounding and accurately approximating mixture entropy directly from component parameters. Our starting point is an information-theoretic channel viewpoint: the latent mixture label plays the role of an input, and the observation is the output. This viewpoint separates mixture entropy into an average within-component uncertainty plus an overlap term that quantifies how much the observation reveals about the hidden label. We then bound and approximate this overlap term using pairwise overlap integrals between component densities, yielding explicit expressions whenever these overlaps admit a closed form. A simple, family-dependent offset corrects the systematic bias of the Jensen overlap bound and is calibrated to be exact in the two limiting regimes of complete overlap and near-perfect separation. A final clipping step guarantees that the estimate always respects universal information-theoretic bounds. Closed-form specializations are provided for Gaussian, factorized Laplacian, uniform, and hybrid mixtures, and numerical experiments validate the resulting bounds and approximations across separation, dimension, number of components, and correlated covariances.</description>

      <title>Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian First-Hitting-Time Modeling for Molecular Communication Under Time-Varying Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a tractable analytical channel model for first-hitting-time molecular communication systems under time-varying drift. While existing studies of nonstationary transport rely primarily on numerical solutions of advection--diffusion equations or parametric impulse-response fitting, they do not provide a closed-form description of trajectory-level arrival dynamics at absorbing boundaries. By adopting a change-of-measure formulation, we reveal a structural decomposition of the first-hitting-time density into a cumulative-drift displacement term and a stochastic boundary-flux modulation factor. This leads to an explicit analytical expression for the Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian (C-IG) density, extending the classical IG model to strongly nonstationary drift conditions while preserving constant-complexity evaluation. High-precision Monte Carlo simulations under both smooth pulsatile and abrupt switching drift profiles confirm that the proposed model accurately captures complex transport phenomena, including phase modulation, multi-pulse dispersion, and transient backflow. The resulting framework provides a physics-informed, computationally efficient channel model suitable for system-level analysis and receiver design in dynamic biological and molecular communication environments.</description>

      <title>A Universal Neural Receiver that Learns at the Speed of Wireless</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today we design wireless networks using mathematical models that govern communication in different propagation environments. We rely on measurement campaigns to deliver parametrized propagation models, and on the 3GPP standards process to optimize model-based performance, but as wireless networks become more complex this model-based approach is losing ground. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are counting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform wireless by increasing spectral efficiency, reducing signaling overhead, and enabling continuous network innovation through software upgrades. They may also be interested in new use cases like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). All we need is an AI-native physical layer, so why not simply tailor the offline AI algorithms that have revolutionized image and natural language processing to the wireless domain? We argue that these algorithms rely on off-line training that is precluded by the sub-millisecond speeds at which the wireless interference environment changes. We present an alternative architecture, a universal neural receiver based on convolution, which governs transmit and receive signal processing of any signal in any part of the wireless spectrum. Our neural receiver is designed to invert convolution, and we separate the question of which convolution to invert from the actual deconvolution. The neural network that performs deconvolution is very simple, and we configure this network by setting weights based on domain knowledge. By telling our neural network what we know, we avoid extensive offline training. By developing a universal receiver, we hope to simplify discussions about the proper choice of waveform for different use cases in the international standards. Since the receiver architecture is largely independent of technologies introduced at the base station, we hope to increase the rate of innovation in wireless.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts under Finite-Rate Gating: Communication--Generalization Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures decompose prediction tasks into specialized expert sub-networks selected by a gating mechanism. This letter adopts a communication-theoretic view of MoE gating, modeling the gate as a stochastic channel operating under a finite information rate. Within an information-theoretic learning framework, we specialize a mutual-information generalization bound and develop a rate-distortion characterization $D(R_g)$ of finite-rate gating, where $R_g:=I(X; T)$, yielding (under a standard empirical rate-distortion optimality condition) $\mathbb{E}[R(W)] \le D(R_g)+\delta_m+\sqrt{(2/m)\, I(S; W)}$. The analysis yields capacity-aware limits for communication-constrained MoE systems, and numerical simulations on synthetic multi-expert models empirically confirm the predicted trade-offs between gating rate, expressivity, and generalization.</description>

      <title>Secure High-Resolution ISAC via Multi-Layer Intelligent Metasurfaces: A Layered Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless networks, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing. However, existing ISAC systems face fundamental limitations in achieving high-resolution sensing while maintaining robust communication security and spectral efficiency. This paper introduces a transformative approach leveraging stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-functional SIM-assisted system that jointly optimizes communication secrecy and sensing accuracy through a novel layered optimization framework. Our solution employs a multi-objective optimization formulation that balances secrecy rate maximization with sensing error minimization under practical hardware constraints. The proposed layered block coordinate descent algorithm efficiently coordinates sensing configuration, secure beamforming, communication metasurface optimization, and resource allocation while ensuring robustness to channel uncertainties. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional approaches, achieving 32-61\% improvement in sensing accuracy and 15-35\% enhancement in secrecy rates while maintaining computational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for secure and high-precision multi-functional wireless systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of detecting a planted star in the Erd{\H{o}}s--R{\'e}nyi random graph $G(n,m)$, formulated as a hypothesis test. We determine the scaling window for critical detection in $m$ in terms of the star size, and characterize the asymptotic total variation distance between the null and alternative hypotheses in this window. In the course of the proofs we show a condensation phase transition in the likelihood ratio that closely resembles that of the random energy model from spin glass theory.</description>

      <title>Curved representational Bregman divergences and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analogy to the terminology of curved exponential families in statistics, we define curved Bregman divergences as Bregman divergences restricted to non-affine parameter subspaces and sub-dimensional Bregman divergences when the restrictions are affine. A common example of curved Bregman divergence is the cosine dissimilarity between normalized vectors: a curved squared Euclidean divergence. We prove that the barycenter of a finite weighted set of parameters under a curved Bregman divergence amounts to the right Bregman projection onto the non-affine subspace of the barycenter with respect to the full Bregman divergence, and interpret a generalization of the weighted Bregman centroid of $n$ parameters as a $n$-fold sub-dimensional Bregman divergence. We demonstrate the significance of curved Bregman divergences with several examples: (1) symmetrized Bregman divergences, (2) pointwise symmetrized Bregman divergences, and (3) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between circular complex normal distributions. We explain how to reparameterize sub-dimensional Bregman divergences on simplicial sub-dimensional domains. We then consider monotonic embeddings to define representational curved Bregman divergences and show that the $\alpha$-divergences are representational curved Bregman divergences with respect to $\alpha$-embeddings of the probability simplex into the positive measure cone. As an application, we report an efficient method to calculate the intersection of a finite set of $\alpha$-divergence spheres. As an application, we report an efficient method to calculate the intersection of a finite set of $\alpha$-divergence spheres.</description>

      <title>Reveal-or-Obscure: A Differentially Private Sampling Algorithm for Discrete Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a differentially private (DP) algorithm called reveal-or-obscure (ROO) to generate a single representative sample from a dataset of $n$ observations drawn i.i.d. from an unknown discrete distribution $P$. Unlike methods that add explicit noise to the estimated empirical distribution, ROO achieves $\epsilon$-differential privacy by randomly choosing whether to "reveal" or "obscure" the empirical distribution. While ROO is structurally identical to Algorithm 1 proposed by Cheu and Nayak (arXiv:2412.10512), we prove a strictly better bound on the sampling complexity than that established in Theorem 12 of (arXiv:2412.10512). To further improve the privacy-utility trade-off, we propose a novel generalized sampling algorithm called Data-Specific ROO (DS-ROO), where the probability of obscuring the empirical distribution of the dataset is chosen adaptively. We prove that DS-ROO satisfies $\epsilon$-DP, and provide empirical evidence that DS-ROO can achieve better utility under the same privacy budget of vanilla ROO.</description>

      <title>On Function-Correcting Codes in the Lee Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes are a coding framework designed to minimize redundancy while ensuring that specific functions or computations of encoded data can be reliably recovered, even in the presence of errors. The choice of metric is crucial in designing such codes, as it determines which computations must be protected and how errors are measured and corrected. Previous work by Liu and Liu [6] studied function-correcting codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^l},\ l\geq 2$ using the homogeneous metric, which coincides with the Lee metric over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. In this paper, we extend the study to codes over $\mathbb{Z}_m,$ for any positive integer $m\geq 2$ under the Lee metric and aim to determine their optimal redundancy. To achieve this, we introduce irregular Lee distance codes and derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal redundancy by characterizing the shortest possible length of such codes. These general bounds are then simplified and applied to specific classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, Lee weight functions, and Lee weight distribution functions. We extend the bounds established by Liu and Liu [6] for codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ in the Lee metric to the more general setting of $\mathbb{Z}_m$. Moreover, we give explicit constructions of function-correcting codes in Lee metric.
  Additionally, we explicitly derive a Plotkin-like bound for linear function-correcting codes in the Lee metric. As the Lee metric coincides with the Hamming metric over the binary field, we demonstrate that our bound naturally reduces to a Plotkin-type bound for function-correcting codes under the Hamming metric over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.</description>

      <title>Improved Constructions of Reed-Solomon Codes with Optimal Repair Bandwidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes are widely used in distributed storage, yet naive repair of a single erasure in an $[n,k]$ MDS code downloads the entire contents of $k$ nodes. Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes (Dimakis et al., 2010) minimize repair bandwidth by contacting $d&gt;k$ helpers and downloading only a fraction of data from each. Guruswami and Wootters first proposed a linear repair scheme for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, showing that they can be repaired with lower bandwidth than the naive approach. The existence of RS codes achieving the MSR point (RS-MSR codes) nevertheless remained open until the breakthrough construction of Tamo, Barg, and Ye, which yields RS-MSR codes with subpacketization $\ell = s \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes satisfying $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{s}$ and $s=d+1-k$.
  In this paper, we present an improved construction of RS-MSR codes by eliminating the congruence condition $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{s}$. Consequently, our construction reduces the subpacketization by a multiplicative factor of $\phi(s)^n$ ( $\phi(\cdot)$ is Euler's totient function) and broadens the range of feasible parameters for RS-MSR codes.</description>

      <title>Quickest Change Detection in Discrete-Time in Presence of a Covert Adversary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of covert quickest change detection in a discrete-time setting, where a sequence of observations undergoes a distributional change at an unknown time. Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who has knowledge of the detector's false alarm constraint parameter $\gamma$ and selects a stationary post-change distribution that depends on it, seeking to remain undetected for as long as possible. Building on the theoretical foundations of the CuSum procedure, we rigorously characterize the asymptotic behavior of the average detection delay (ADD) and the average time to false alarm (AT2FA) when the post-change distribution converges to the pre-change distribution as $\gamma \to \infty$. Our analysis establishes exact asymptotic expressions for these quantities, extending and refining classical results that no longer hold in this regime. We identify the critical scaling laws governing covert behavior and derive explicit conditions under which an adversary can maintain covertness, defined by ADD = $\Theta(\gamma)$, whereas in the classical setting, ADD grows only as $\mathcal{O}(\log \gamma)$. In particular, for Gaussian and Exponential models under adversarial perturbations of their respective parameters, we asymptotically characterize ADD as a function of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions and $\gamma$.</description>

Abstract: We study the amount of reliable information that can be stored in a DNA-based storage system with noisy sequencing, where each codeword is composed of short DNA molecules. We analyze a concatenated coding scheme, where the outer code is designed to handle the random sampling, while the inner code is designed to handle the random sequencing noise. We assume that the sequencing channel is symmetric and choose the inner coding scheme to be composed by a linear block code and a zero-undetected-error decoder. As a byproduct, the resulting optimal maximum-likelihood decoder land itself for an amenable analysis, and we are able to derive an achievability bound for the scaling of the number of information bits that can be reliably stored. As a result of independent interest, we prove that the average error probability of random linear block codes under zero-undetected-error decoding converges to zero exponentially fast with the block length, as long as its coding rate does not exceed some critical value, which is known to serve as a lower bound to the zero-undetected-error capacity.</description>

      <title>Token-Based Audio Inpainting via Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio inpainting seeks to restore missing segments in degraded recordings. Previous diffusion-based methods exhibit impaired performance when the missing region is large. We introduce the first approach that applies discrete diffusion over tokenized music representations from a pre-trained audio tokenizer, enabling stable and semantically coherent restoration of long gaps. Our method further incorporates two training approaches: a derivative-based regularization loss that enforces smooth temporal dynamics, and a span-based absorbing transition that provides structured corruption during diffusion. Experiments on the MusicNet and MAESTRO datasets with gaps up to 750 ms show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines across range of gap lengths, for gaps of 150 ms and above. This work advances musical audio restoration and introduces new directions for discrete diffusion model training. Visit our project page for examples and code.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Personalization of Generative Models via Optimal Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference learning from human feedback has the ability to align generative models with the needs of end-users. Human feedback is costly and time-consuming to obtain, which creates demand for data-efficient query selection methods. This work presents a novel approach that leverages optimal experimental design to ask humans the most informative preference queries, from which we can elucidate the latent reward function modeling user preferences efficiently. We formulate the problem of preference query selection as the one that maximizes the information about the underlying latent preference model. We show that this problem has a convex optimization formulation, and introduce a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm ED-PBRL that is supported by theoretical guarantees and can efficiently construct structured queries such as images or text. We empirically present the proposed framework by personalizing a text-to-image generative model to user-specific styles, showing that it requires less preference queries compared to random query selection.</description>
