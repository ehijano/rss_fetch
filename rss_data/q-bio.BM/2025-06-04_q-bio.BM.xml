      <title>UniSim: A Unified Simulator for Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Biomolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding the atomic-level behavior of molecular systems, giving insights into their transitions and interactions. However, classical MD techniques are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, while recent deep learning-based improvements have mostly focused on single-domain molecules, lacking transferability to unfamiliar molecular systems. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{Sim}ulator (UniSim), which leverages cross-domain knowledge to enhance the understanding of atomic interactions. First, we employ a multi-head pretraining approach to learn a unified atomic representation model from a large and diverse set of molecular data. Then, based on the stochastic interpolant framework, we learn the state transition patterns over long timesteps from MD trajectories, and introduce a force guidance module for rapidly adapting to different chemical environments. Our experiments demonstrate that UniSim achieves highly competitive performance across small molecules, peptides, and proteins.</description>

      <title>STELLA: Towards Protein Function Prediction with Multimodal LLMs Integrating Sequence-Structure Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein biology focuses on the intricate relationships among sequences, structures, and functions. Deciphering protein functions is crucial for understanding biological processes, advancing drug discovery, and enabling synthetic biology applications. Since protein sequences determine tertiary structures, which in turn govern functions, integrating sequence and structure information is essential for accurate prediction of protein functions. Traditional protein language models (pLMs) have advanced protein-related tasks by learning representations from large-scale sequence and structure data. However, pLMs are limited in integrating broader contextual knowledge, particularly regarding functional modalities that are fundamental to protein biology. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited outstanding performance in contextual understanding, reasoning, and generation across diverse domains. Leveraging these capabilities, STELLA is proposed as a multimodal LLM integrating protein sequence-structure representations with general knowledge to address protein function prediction. Through multimodal instruction tuning (MMIT) using the proposed OPI-Struc dataset, STELLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in two function-related tasks-functional description prediction (FP) and enzyme-catalyzed reaction prediction (EP). This study highlights the potential of multimodal LLMs as an alternative paradigm to pLMs to advance protein biology research.</description>

      <title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection. The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.</description>

      <title>CellFlux: Simulating Cellular Morphology Changes via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research. Project page: https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/CellFlux/.</description>
