      <title>Microwave sink using plasma based localized surface plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcoming the diffraction limit, meaning focusing waves on a sub-wavelength scale, has received considerable attention for applications involving light and acoustics. Indeed, the intense focusing achieved enhances the interactions between waves and matter, and the improved spatial resolution opens up possibilities in fields such as imaging, detection and communication. In optics, a passive sink may be obtained if the incident light couples to localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonances, resulting in Coherent Perfect Absorption condition. The presence of optical surface plasmons at metal interfaces is due to the angular frequency of metals, which lies in the optical regime due to their high density of free electrons. Plasmas, which consists of ionized gazes with a lower electron density, can support surface plasmons in the microwave regime. Hence, we demonstrate in this paper that sub-wavelength plasmas behave as a passive microwave sink by exciting LSP resonance inside the plasma.</description>

      <title>Pulse-induced memory-like effect in cyclotron motion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field along its standard circular path (cyclotron motion) reacts to a short-duration, homogeneous, uniform electric field pulse injected in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. A `permanent' change in the radius of the initial circle and a shift of its centre is noted at later times, after the pulse is switched off. The velocity vector (components and magnitude) undergoes a change too, akin to a `velocity kick'. The cause behind this permanent change appears to be linked to the difference between the vector potentials before and after the duration of the electric pulse. Further, we show how such vector potentials in the past and future are related through a gauge transformation. In summary, our results suggest a pulse-induced `electromagnetic memory-like effect', which is not quite a `wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context.</description>
