      <title>Omniscient Attacker in Stochastic Security Games with Interdependent Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of reinforcement learning for critical infrastructure defense introduces a vulnerability where sophisticated attackers can strategically exploit the defense algorithm's learning dynamics. While prior work addresses this vulnerability in the context of repeated normal-form games, its extension to the stochastic games remains an open research gap. We close this gap by examining stochastic security games between an RL defender and an omniscient attacker, utilizing a tractable linear influence network model. To overcome the structural limitations of prior methods, we propose and apply neuro-dynamic programming. Our experimental results demonstrate that the omniscient attacker can significantly outperform a naive defender, highlighting the critical vulnerability introduced by the learning dynamics and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Side-by-side first-price auctions with imperfect bidders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model a procurement scenario in which two \textit{imperfect} bidders act simultaneously on behalf of a single buyer, a configuration common in display advertising and referred to as \textit{side-by-side bidding} but largely unexplored in theory. We prove that the iterated best response algorithm converges to an equilibrium under standard distributional assumptions and provide sufficient condition for uniqueness. Beyond establishing existence and convergence, our analysis provides a tractable numerical method for quantitative studies of side-by-side procurement.</description>

      <title>Timely Information for Strategic Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility.</description>

      <title>Playing the Player: A Heuristic Framework for Adaptive Poker AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For years, the discourse around poker AI has been dominated by the concept of solvers and the pursuit of unexploitable, machine-perfect play. This paper challenges that orthodoxy. It presents Patrick, an AI built on the contrary philosophy: that the path to victory lies not in being unexploitable, but in being maximally exploitative. Patrick's architecture is a purpose-built engine for understanding and attacking the flawed, psychological, and often irrational nature of human opponents. Through detailed analysis of its design, its novel prediction-anchored learning method, and its profitable performance in a 64,267-hand trial, this paper makes the case that the solved myth is a distraction from the real, far more interesting challenge: creating AI that can master the art of human imperfection.</description>

      <title>Candidate Monotonicity and Proportionality for Lotteries and Non-Resolute Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing multiwinner voting rules that are candidate monotone and proportional. We show that the set of committees satisfying the proportionality axiom of proportionality for solid coalitions is candidate monotone. We further show that Phragm\'en's Ordered Rule can be turned into a candidate monotone probabilistic rule which randomizes over committees satisfying proportionality for solid coalitions.</description>

      <title>Fisher Meets Lindahl: A Unified Duality Framework for Market Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fisher market equilibrium for private goods and the Lindahl equilibrium for public goods are classic and fundamental solution concepts for market equilibria. While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the theoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially underdeveloped.
  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria. We show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher market equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa. The dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence between the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and prices.
  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation and dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments for Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze welfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we prove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For concave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves $(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is tight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including proportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\^atonnement. We obtain new market dynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher market. We also use duality to extend PRD to markets with total complements utilities, the dual class of gross substitutes utilities. Finally, we apply the duality framework to markets with chores. We propose a program for private chores for general convex homogeneous disutilities that avoids the "poles" issue, whose KKT points correspond to Fisher market equilibria. We also initiate the study of the Lindahl equilibrium for public chores.</description>
