      <title>A temperature scale of $1\sim2$ eV in the mass-radius relationship of white dwarfs of type DA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass-radius relationship of white dwarfs (WDs) is one of their defining characteristics, largely derived from electron degeneracy pressure. We present a model-independent study of the observed mass-radius relationship in WD binaries of \cite{Parsons_2017}, listing data over a broad temperature range up to about 60,000 K (5 eV). The data show an appreciable temperature sensitivity with pronounced intrinsic scatter (beyond measurement uncertainty) for the canonical He-models with proton-to-neutron ratio 1:1. We characterize temperature sensitivity by a temperature scale $T_0$ in model-agnostic power-law relations with temperature normalized radius. For low-mass WDs, the results identify a remarkably modest $T_0 = 1 \sim 2 $ eV. We comment on a potential interpretation for atmospheres insulating super-Eddington temperature cores from the sub-Eddington photospheres of low-mass WDs.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on Stellar Companions to the Kepler-34 and Kepler-35 Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtained new spectra of Kepler-34 and Kepler-35 with Keck-HIRES, nearly a decade after these systems were originally characterized with this spectrograph and other instruments, to search for RV trends from a potential third stellar-mass companion at long periods. For Kepler-34, we rule out coplanar stellar masses as low as $0.12 M_\odot$ at an orbital period of $\lesssim 52$ years. For Kepler-35, we rule out stellar masses of $0.13 M_\odot$ at orbital periods of $\lesssim 55$ years. Highly stable, extreme precision RV instruments, as well as improved methodologies in characterizing double-lined spectroscopic binaries that come with these new instruments, will provide an opportunity to push these mass limits lower in the future.</description>

      <title>The companion mass distribution of post common envelope hot subdwarf binaries: evidence for boosted and disrupted magnetic braking?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the mass distribution of main-sequence (MS) companions to hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) in post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs). We carried out a spectroscopic survey of 14 eclipsing systems ("HW Vir binaries") with orbital periods of $3.8 &lt; P_{\rm orb} &lt; 12$ hours, resulting in a well-understood selection function and a near-complete sample of HW Vir binaries with $G &lt; 16$. We constrain companion masses from the radial velocity curves of the sdB stars. The companion mass distribution peaks at $M_{\rm MS}\approx 0.15 M_{\odot}$ and drops off at $M_{\rm MS} &gt; 0.2\,M_{\odot}$, with only two systems hosting companions above the fully-convective limit. There is no correlation between $P_{\rm orb}$ and $M_{\rm MS}$ within the sample. A similar drop-off in the companion mass distribution of white dwarf (WD) + MS PCEBs has been attributed to disrupted magnetic braking (MB) below the fully-convective limit. We compare the sdB companion mass distribution to predictions of binary evolution simulations with a range of MB laws. Because sdBs have short lifetimes compared to WDs, explaining the lack of higher-mass MS companions to sdBs with disrupted MB requires MB to be boosted by a factor of 20-100 relative to MB laws inferred from the rotation evolution of single stars. We speculate that such boosting may be a result of irradiation-driven enhancement of the MS stars' winds. An alternative possibility is that common envelope evolution favors low-mass companions in short-period orbits, but the existence of massive WD companions to sdBs with similar periods disfavors this scenario.</description>

      <title>NSVS 14256825: period variation and orbital stability analysis of two possible substellar companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent period investigations of the Post-Common Envelop Binary (PCEB) NSVS 14256825 suggested that two circumbinary companions were necessary to explain the observed Eclipse Timing Variations (ETVs). Our objective was to search for the best-fitting curve of two LTTE terms in the ETV diagram, implementing a grid search optimization scheme of Keplerian (kinematic) and Newtonian (N-body) fits, alongside a dynamical stability analysis of N-body simulations. We compiled two datasets of archival photometric data covering a different timeline and updated them with new observations and with three new times of minima (TOMs) calculated from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}). A grid search optimization process was implemented and the resulted solutions, that fell within the $90\%$ confidence interval of the best-fitting curve of the ETV diagram, were tested for orbital stability using N-body simulations and the MEGNO chaos indicator. The Keplerian and Netwonian fits are in close agreement and hundreds of stable configurations were identified for both datasets reaching a lifetime of 1 Myr. Our results suggest that the ETV data can be explained by the presence of a circumbinary planet with mass $m_b=11 M_{Jup.}$ in a nearly circular inner orbit of period $P_b = 7$ yr. The outer orbit is unconstrained with a period range $P_c=20-50$ yr (from 3:1 to 7:1 MMR) for a circumbinary body of substellar mass ($m_c=11-70 M_{Jup.}$). The stable solutions of the minimum and maximum reduced chi-square value were integrated for 100 Myr and confirmed a non-chaotic behavior. Their residuals in the ETV data could be explained by a spin-orbit-coupling model (Applegate-Lanza). Continuous monitoring of the system is required in order to refine and constrain the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Is There a Synchronizing Influence of Planets on Solar and Stellar Cyclic Activity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work continues our research of connection between the long-term activity of stars and their planets. We analyze new data on the previously considered two dozen solar-type stars with identified cycles, adding the results of studying the long-term variability of two more solar-type G stars and 15 cooler M dwarfs with planets. If the cyclic activity is determined by a strong tidal influence of the planet, then the cycle duration of the star should be synchronized with the period of orbital revolution of the planet. We calculate the gravitational effect of planets on their parent stars. The results obtained confirm the earlier conclusion that exoplanets do not influence the formation of the stellar cycle. We examine the change in the position of the barycenter of the solar system relative to the center of the Sun over 420 years. A comparison of these data with the most reliable 120-year SSN (sunspot number) series as the index of solar activity has shown that they are not synchronized.</description>

      <title>Very long-periodic pulsations detected simultaneously in a white-light flare and sunspot penumbra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of very long-periodic pulsations (VLPs) in the white-light emission of an X6.4 flare on 2024 February 22 (SOL2024-02-22T22:08), which occurred at the edge of a sunspot group. The flare white-light fluxes reveal four successive and repetitive pulsations, which are simultaneously measured by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and the White-light Solar Telescope. A quasi-period of 8.6$^{+1.5}_{-1.9}$ minutes, determined by the Morlet wavelet transform, is detected in the visible continuum channel. The modulation depth, which is defined as the ratio between the oscillatory amplitude and its long-term trend, is smaller than 0.1%, implying that the QPP feature is a weak wave process. Imaging observations show that the X6.4 flare occurs near a sunspot group. Moreover, the white-light brightening is located in sunspot penumbra, and a similar quasi-period of about 8.5$^{+1.6}_{-1.8}$ minutes is identified in one penumbral location of the nearest sunspot. The map of Fourier power distribution suggests that a similar periodicity is universally existing in most parts of the penumbra that is close to the penumbral-photospheric boundary. Our observations support the scenario of that the white-light QPP is probably modulated by the slow-mode magnetoacoustic gravity wave leaking from the sunspot penumbra.</description>

      <title>A 2.9-hour periodic radio transient with an optical counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a long-period radio transient (GLEAM-X J0704-37) discovered to have an optical counterpart, consistent with a cool main sequence star of spectral type M3. The radio pulsations occur at the longest period yet found, 2.9 hours, and were discovered in archival low-frequency data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). High time resolution observations from MeerKAT show that pulsations from the source display complex microstructure and high linear polarisation, suggesting a pulsar-like emission mechanism occurring due to strong, ordered magnetic fields. The timing residuals, measured over more than a decade, show tentative evidence of a ~6-yr modulation. The high Galactic latitude of the system and the M-dwarf star excludes the magnetar interpretation, suggesting a more likely M-dwarf / white dwarf binary scenario for this system.</description>

      <title>ODUSSEAS: Upgraded version with new reference scale and parameter determinations for 82 planet-host M dwarf stars in SWEET-Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: Obtaining accurate derivations of stellar atmospheric parameters is crucial in the fields of stellar and exoplanet characterization. We present the upgraded version of our computational tool ODUSSEAS with a new reference scale applied to derive $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and [Fe/H] values for M dwarfs.
  Methods: The new reference dataset of ODUSSEAS consists of $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values based on interferometry, and [Fe/H] values derived by applying updated values for the parallaxes. These reference parameters are related to the pseudo-equivalent widths (EWs) of more than 4000 stellar absorption lines. The machine learning Python "scikit learn" package creates models to determine the stellar parameters for subsequent analysis.
  Results: We determined $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and [Fe/H] values for 82 planet-host stars in SWEET-Cat. We demonstrate that our new version of ODUSSEAS is capable of determining the parameters with a greater accuracy than the original by comparing our results to other methods in literature. We also compared our parameters for the same stars by measuring their spectra obtained from several instruments, showing the consistency of our determinations with standard deviation of 30 K and 0.03 dex. Finally, we examined the correlation among planetary mass and stellar metallicity, confirming prior evidence indicating that massive planets mainly form around metal-rich stars in the case of M dwarfs as well.</description>

      <title>Mass-transfer Outburts reborn: Modeling the light curve of the dwarf nova EX Draconis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EX Draconis is an eclipsing dwarf nova that shows outbursts with moderate amplitude ($\simeq 2$ mag) and a recurrence timescale of $\simeq 20$-30 d. Dwarf novae outbursts are explained in terms of either a thermal-viscous instability in the disc or an instability in the mass transfer rate of the donor star (MTIM). We developed simulations of the response of accretion discs to events of enhanced mass transfer, in the context of the MTIM, and applied them to model the light curve and variations in the radius of the EX Dra disc throughout the outburst. We obtain the first modeling of a dwarf nova outburst by using $\chi^2$ to select, from a grid of simulations, the best-fit parameters to the observed EX Dra outbursts. The observed time evolution of the system brightness and the changes in the radius of the outer disc along the outburst cycle are satisfactorily reproduced by a model of the response of an accretion disc with a viscosity parameter $\alpha = 4.0$ and a quiescent mass transfer rate $\dot{M}_2 (\textrm{quiescence}) = 4.0 \times 10^{16}$ g/s to an event of width $\Delta t = 6.0 \times 10^5$ s ($\sim 7$ d) where the mass-transfer rate increases to $\dot{M}_2 (\textrm{outburst}) = 1.5 \times 10^{18}$ g/s.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic cooling in optically thin plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar corona is the prototypical example of a low density environment heated to high temperatures by external sources. The plasma cools radiatively, and because it is optically thin to this radiation, it becomes possible to model the density, velocity, and temperature structure of the system by modifying the MHD equations to include energy source terms that approximate the local heating and cooling rates. The solutions can be highly inhomogeneous and even multiphase because the well known linear instability associated with these source terms, thermal instability, leads to a catastrophic heating and cooling of the plasma in the nonlinear regime. Here we show that there is a separate, much simpler instance of catastrophic heating and cooling accompanying these source terms that can rival thermal instability in dynamical importance. The linear stability criterion is the isochoric one identified by Parker (1953), and we demonstrate that cooling functions derived from collisional ionization equilibrium are highly prone to violating this criterion. If catastrophic cooling instability can act locally in global simulations, then it is an alternative mechanism for forming condensations, and due to its nonequilibrium character, it may be relevant to explaining a host of phenomena associated with the production of cooler gas in hot, low density plasmas.</description>

      <title>The ESO UVES/FEROS Large Programs of TESS OB pulsators. II. On the physical origin of macroturbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral lines of hot massive stars are known to exhibit large excess broadening in addition to rotational broadening. This excess broadening is often attributed to macroturbulence whose physical origin is a matter of active debate in the stellar astrophysics community. By looking into the statistical properties of a large sample of O- and B-type stars, both in the Galaxy and LMC, we aim to shed light on the physical origin of macroturbulent line broadening. We deliver newly measured macroturbulent velocities for 86 stars from the Galaxy in a consistent manner with 126 stars from the LMC. A total sample of 594 O- and B-type stars with measured macroturbulent velocities was composed by complementing our sample with archival data. Furthermore, we compute an extensive grid of MESA models to compare, in a statistical manner, the predicted interior properties of stars (such as convection and wave propagation) with the inference of macroturbulent velocities from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. We find the presence of two principally different regimes where, depending on the initial stellar mass, different mechanisms may be responsible for the observed excess line broadening. Stars with initial masses above some 30$M_{\odot}$ are found to have macroturbulent velocities fully determined by subsurface convective zones formed in the iron opacity bump (FeCZ), while some other mechanism is required to explain observations for masses below 12$M_{\odot}$. The latter finding leaves the potential for waves generated at the interface of the convective core and radiative envelope of the star to be responsible for the observed macroturbulent broadening. Both mechanisms may co-exist in the intermediate regime of stellar masses, between some 12 and 30$M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Fast Downflows Observed during a Polar Crown Filament Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar filaments can undergo eruptions and result in the formation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which could significantly impact planetary space environments. Observations of eruptions involving polar crown filaments, situated in the polar regions of the Sun, are limited. In this study, we report a polar crown filament eruption (SOL2023-06-12), characterized by fast downflows below the filament. The downflows appear instantly after the onset of the filament eruption and persist for approximately 2 hours, exhibiting plane-of-sky (POS) velocities ranging between 92 and 144 km s$^{-1}$. They originate from the leading edge of the filament and no clear acceleration is observed. Intriguingly, these downflows appear at two distinct sites, symmetrically positioned at the opposite ends of the conjugate flare ribbons. Based on the observations, we propose that the filament might be supported by a magnetic flux rope (MFR), and these downflows possibly occur along the legs of the MFR. The downflows likely result from continuous reconnections between the MFR and the overlying magnetic field structures, and could either be reconnection outflows or redirected filament materials. We also observed horizontal drifting of the locations of downflows, which might correspond to the MFR's footpoint drifting. This type of downflows can potentially be utilized to track the footpoints of MFRs during eruptions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Acoustic Wave Energy Fluxes and Radiative Losses in the Solar Chromosphere from Non-LTE Inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately assessing the balance between acoustic wave energy fluxes and radiative losses is critical for understanding how the solar chromosphere is thermally regulated. We investigate the energy balance in the chromosphere by comparing deposited acoustic flux and radiative losses under quiet and active solar conditions using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) inversions with the Stockholm Inversion Code (STiC). To achieve this, we utilize spectroscopic observations from the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) in the Na I 5896 \r{A} and Ca II 8542 \r{A} lines and from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in the Mg II h and k lines to self-consistently derive spatially resolved velocity power spectra and cooling rates across different heights in the atmosphere. Additionally, we use snapshots of a three-dimensional radiative-magnetohydrodynamics simulation to investigate the systematic effects of the inversion approach, particularly the attenuation effect on the velocity power spectra and the determination of the cooling rates. The results indicate that inversions potentially underestimate acoustic fluxes at all chromospheric heights while slightly overestimating the radiative losses when fitting these spectral lines. However, even after accounting for these biases, the ratio of acoustic flux to radiative losses remains below unity in most observed regions, particularly in the higher layers of the chromosphere. We also observe a correlation between the magnetic field inclination in the photosphere and radiative losses in the low chromosphere in plage, which is evidence that the field topology plays a role in the chromospheric losses.</description>

      <title>VLT/MUSE detection of accretion-ejection associated with the close stellar companion in the HT Lup system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion/ejection processes in T-Tauri stars are fundamental to their physical evolution, while also impacting the properties and evolution of the circumstellar material at a time when planet formation takes place. To this date, characterization of ongoing accretion processes in stellar pairs at 5-50\,au scales has been challenging, high angular resolution spectrographs are required to extract the spectral features of each component. We present the analysis of spectroscopic observations of the tight (160mas, 25au) T-Tauri system HT Lup A/B, obtained with MUSE at VLT in March and July of 2021. We focus on constraining the accretion/ejection processes and variability of the secondary component HT Lup B, by searching for accretion tracers applying High-Resolution Spectral Differential Imaging techniques. We retrieve strong (SNR $&gt;$ 5) $H\alpha, H\beta$ and [OI]$\lambda6300$ emission in both epochs. The $H\alpha$ and $H\beta$ line fluxes showcase high variability, with variations up to 400-500\% between epochs. The fluxes are consistent with accretion rates of $8\times10^{-9} M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$ and $2\times10^{-9} M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$ for the first and second epoch, respectively. We attribute the increased accretion activity during the first night to a "burst" like event, followed by a relaxation period more representative of the common accretion activity of the system. The [OI]$\lambda6300$ line profiles remain relatively similar between epochs and suggest ejection rates on the order of $10^{-9}-10^{-10} M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$, compatible with moderate disk winds emission. Our results also indicate that the accretion processes of HT Lup B are compatible with Classical T Tauri Stars, unlike previous classifications</description>

      <title>The Way To Circumbinary Planets</title>

Abstract: Circumbinary planets (CBPs) are planets that orbit around both stars of a binary system. This chapter traces the history of research on CBPs and provides an overview over the current knowledge about CBPs and their detection methods. After early speculations about CBPs, inspired by binary star systems and popularized by fictional works, their scientific exploration began with the identification of circumbinary dust disks and progressed to the detection and characterization of the current sample of CBPs. The major part of this review presents the detection methods for CBPs: eclipse timing variations from the light-travel-time effect and from dynamical interactions, transits, radial velocities, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing and astrometry. Each of these methods is described with its strengths and limitations and the main characeristics of the CBP systems found by them are outlined. The potential habitability of CBPs is considered, taking into account the unique environmental conditions created by orbiting a stellar binary. The importance of multi-method detection strategies is underscored, and future advancements from upcoming missions like PLATO are anticipated, promising to expand the understanding of these intriguing celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Are Stars Really Ingesting their Planets? Examining an Alternative Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous stars exhibit surprisingly large variations in their refractory element abundances, often interpreted as signatures of planetary ingestion events. In this study, we propose that differences in the dust-to-gas ratio near stars during their formation can produce similar observational signals. We investigate this hypothesis using a suite of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic STARFORGE simulations of star formation. Our results show that the distribution of refractory abundance variations ($\rm \Delta [X/H]$) has extended tails, with about 10-30% of all stars displaying variations around $\sim$0.1 dex. These variations are comparable to the accretion of $2-5 \rm M_\oplus$ of planetary material into the convective zones of Sun-like stars. The width of the distributions increases with the incorporation of more detailed dust physics, such as radiation pressure and back-reaction forces, as well as with larger dust grain sizes and finer resolutions. Furthermore, our simulations reveal no correlation between $\rm \Delta [X/H]$ and stellar separations, suggesting that dust-to-gas fluctuations likely occur on scales smaller than those of wide binaries. These findings highlight the importance of considering dust dynamics as a potential source of the observed chemical enrichment in stars.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the physical origin of large cavities in transition disks from multi-wavelength dust continuum emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of the large cavities observed in transition disks is to date still unclear. Different physical mechanisms (e.g., a companion, dead zones, enhanced grain growth) produce disk cavities of different depth, and the expected spatial distribution of gas and solids in each mechanism is not the same. In this work, we analyze the multi-wavelength interferometric visibilities of dust continuum observations obtained with ALMA and VLA for six transition disks: CQTau, UXTau A, LkCa15, RXJ1615, SR24S, and DMTau, and calculate brightness radial profiles, where diverse emission morphology is revealed at different wavelengths. The multi-wavelength data is used to model the spectral energy distribution and compute constraints on the radial profile of the dust surface density, maximum grain size, and dust temperature in each disk. They are compared with the observational signatures expected from various physical mechanisms responsible for disk cavities. The observational signatures suggest that the cavities observed in the disks around UXTau A, LkCa15, and RXJ1615 could potentially originate from a dust trap created by a companion. Conversely, in the disks around CQTau, SR24S, DMTau, the origin of the cavity remains unclear, although it is compatible with a pressure bump and grain growth within the cavity.</description>

      <title>Stellar modeling via the Tolman IV solution: The cases of the massive pulsar J0740+6620 and the HESS J1731-347 compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model compact objects of known stellar mass and radius made of isotropic matter within Einstein's gravity. The interior solution describing hydrostatic equilibrium we are using throughout the manuscript corresponds to the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. The three free parameters of the solutions are determined imposing the matching conditions for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that contrary to the Kohler Chao solution, the Tolman IV solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. except for the relativistic adiabatic index that diverges at the surface of the stars. The divergence of the index $\Gamma$ may be resolved including a thin crust assuming a polytropic equation-of-state, which is precisely the case seen in studies of neutron stars. To the best of our knowledge, we model here for the first time the recently discovered massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 and the strangely light HESS compact object via the Tolman IV solution. The present work may be of interest to model builders as well as a useful reference for future research.</description>

      <title>Unveiling accretion in the massive YSO G033.3891. Spatial and kinematic constraints from the CO bandhead emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner parts of the hot discs surrounding massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) are still barely explored due to observational limitations in terms of angular resolution, scarcity of diagnostic lines and the embedded and rare nature of these targets. We present the first K-band spectro-interferometric observations toward the MYSO G033.3891, which based on former kinematic evidence via the CO bandhead emission is known to host an accreting disc. Using the high spectral resolution mode (R$\sim$4000) of the GRAVITY/VLTI, we spatially resolve the emission of the inner dusty disc and the crucial gaseous interface between the star and the dusty disc. Using detailed modelling on the K-band dust continuum and tracers known to be associated with the ionised and molecular gaseous interface (Br$\gamma$, CO), we report on the smallest scales of accretion/ejection. The new observations in combination with our geometric and kinematic models employed to fit former high spectral resolution observations on the source (R$\sim$30,000; CRIRES/VLTI) allow us to constrain the size of the inner gaseous disc both spatially and kinematically via the CO overtone emission at only 2 au. Our models reveal that both Br$\gamma$ and CO emissions are located well within the dust sublimation radius (5~au) as traced by the hot 2.2~$\mu$m dust continuum. Our paper provides the first case study where the tiniest scales of gaseous accretion around the MYSO G033.3891 are probed both kinematically and spatially via the CO bandhead emission. This analysis of G033.3891 stands as only the second instance of such investigation within MYSOs, underscoring the gradual accumulation of knowledge regarding how massive young stars gain their mass, while further solidifying the disc nature of accretion at the smallest scales of MYSOs.</description>

      <title>Casting Light on Degeneracies: A Comprehensive Study of Lightcurve Variations in Microlensing Events OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15669v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates orbital parallax in gravitational microlensing events, focusing on OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For events with timescales $\leq$ 60 days, a Jerk Parallax degeneracy arises due to high Jerk velocity ($\tilde{v_{j}}$), causing a four-fold continuous parallax degeneracy. OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, after incorporating orbital parallax, reveals four discrete degenerate parallax solutions, while OGLE-2017-BLG-0192 exhibits four discrete solutions without degeneracy. {The asymmetric light curve of OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 suggests a more probable model where xallarap is added to the parallax model, introducing tension. The galactic model analysis predicts a very low mass stellar lens for OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, degenerate solutions suggest a low-mass star or a darker lens in the disc, while the Xallarap+Parallax model also predicts a stellar lens in the bulge, with the source being a solar-type star orbited by a dwarf star.} This study presents five degenerate solutions for OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, emphasizing the potential for confirmation through high-resolution Adaptive Optics (AO) observations with Extremely Large Telescopes in the future. The complexities of degenerate scenarios in these microlensing events underscore the need to analyze special single-lens events in the Roman Telescope Era.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Mechanisms of Water Maser Variability During the Accretion Burst in NGC6334I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HMYSOs gain most of their mass in short bursts of accretion. Maser emission is an invaluable tool in discovering and probing accretion bursts. We observed the 22 GHz water maser response induced by the accretion burst in NGC6334I-MM1B and identified the underlying maser variability mechanisms. We report seven epochs of VLBI observations of 22 GHz water masers in NGC6334I with the VERA array, from 2014 to 2016, spanning the onset of the accretion burst in 2015.1. We also report 2019 ALMA observations of 321 GHz water masers and 22 GHz maser monitoring by HartRAO. We analyze variability patterns and use proper motions with the 22 GHz to 321 GHz line ratio to distinguish between masers in C-shocks and J-shocks. We also calculated the burst-to-quiescent variance ratio of the single-dish time series. The constant mean proper motion before and after the burst indicates that maser variability is due to excitation effects from variable radiation rather than jet ejecta. We find that the flux density variance ratio in the single-dish time series can identify maser efficiency variations in 22 GHz masers. The northern region, CM2-W2, is excited in C-shocks and showed long-term flaring with velocity-dependent excitation of new maser features. We propose that radiative heating of H2 due to high-energy radiation from the accretion burst be the mechanism for the flaring in CM2-W2. The southern regions are excited by J-shocks and have short-term flaring and dampening of water masers. We attributed the diverse variability patterns in the southern regions to the radiative transfer of the burst energy in the source. Our results indicate that the effects of source geometry, shock type, and incident radiation spectrum are fundamental factors affecting 22 GHz maser variability. Investigating water masers in irradiated shocks will improve their use as a diagnostic in time-variable radiation environments.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of massive scalar-tensor theories on the internal properties, crystallization, and cooling process of white dwarf stars that might potentially solve observational tensions. We show that these modified gravity theories alter the inner structure of the star leading to sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. This further results in a modification of Debye temperature, ion and electron specific heats. Finally, we find that the cooling process is significantly shortened in scalar-tensor theories leading to reduced cooling ages.</description>

      <title>The updated BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The modeling of stellar spectra of flux standards observed by the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes requires a large synthetic spectral library that covers a wide atmospheric parameter range.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe the calculation methods behind the updated version of the BOSZ synthetic spectral database, which was originally designed to fit the CALSPEC flux standards. These new local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models incorporate both MARCS and ATLAS9 model atmospheres, updated continuous opacities, and 23 new molecular line lists.
  Methods. The new grid was calculated with Synspec using the LTE approximation and covers metallicities [M/H] from -2.5 to 0.75 dex, [alpha/M] from -0.25 to 0.5 dex, and [C/M] from -0.75 to 0.5 dex, providing spectra for 336 unique compositions. Calculations for stars between 2800 and 8000 K use MARCS model atmospheres, and ATLAS9 is used between 7500 and 16,000 K.
  Results. The new BOSZ grid includes 628,620 synthetic spectra from 50 nm to 32 microns with models for 495 Teff - log g parameter pairs per composition and per microturbulent velocity. Each spectrum has eight different resolutions spanning a range from R = 500 to 50,000 as well as the original resolution of the synthesis. The microturbulent velocities are 0, 1, 2, and 4 km/s.
  Conclusions. The new BOSZ grid extends the temperature range to cooler temperatures compared to the original grid because the updated molecular line lists make modeling possible for cooler stars. A publicly available and consistently calculated database of model spectra is important for many astrophysical analyses, for example spectroscopic surveys and the determination of stellar elemental compositions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for magnetic boundary layer accretion in RU Lup. A spectrophotometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to characterize the accretion process of the classical T Tauri Star RU Lup. We studied optical high-resolution spectroscopic observations from CHIRON and ESPRESSO, obtained simultaneously with photometric data from AAVSO and TESS. We detected a periodic modulation in the narrow component of the He I 5876 line with a period that is compatible with the stellar rotation period, indicating the presence of a compact region on the stellar surface that we identified as the footprint of the accretion shock. We show that this region is responsible for the veiling spectrum, which is made up of a continuum component plus narrow line emission. An analysis of the high-cadence TESS light curve reveals quasi-periodic oscillations on timescales shorter than the stellar rotation period, suggesting that the accretion disk in RU~Lup extends inward of the corotation radius, with a truncation radius at $\sim 2 ~ R_{\star}$. This is compatible with predictions from three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic models of accretion through a magnetic boundary layer (MBL). In this scenario, the photometric variability of RU Lup is produced by a nonstationary hot spot on the stellar surface that rotates with the Keplerian period at the truncation radius. The analysis of the broad components of selected emission lines reveals the existence of a non-axisymmetric, temperature-stratified flow around the star, in which the gas leaves the accretion disk at the truncation radius and accretes onto the star channeled by the magnetic field lines. The unusually rich metallic emission line spectrum of RU Lup might be characteristic of the MBL regime of accretion. In conclusion, the behavior of RU Lup reveals many similarities to predictions from the MBL accretion scenario. Alternative explanations would require the existence of a hot spot with a complex shape, or a warped structure in the inner disk.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE III: The IMF in Quasar Accretion Disks from STARFORGE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations, including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches) in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then dynamically decouple from the gas and wander, ceasing accretion on timescales ~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are swept up into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as the global dynamical times can become incredibly short ($\ll$ yr) and tidal fields are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular momentum or fragment catastrophically at $\lesssim 10$ au scales requires novel PSD simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs, though we discuss a couple of viable models.</description>

      <title>X-ray Variability in the Symbiotic Binary RT Cru: Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hard X-ray-emitting ($\delta$-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of the $\delta$-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multi-mission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components that contribute most to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%) - which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band - are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 65$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 90$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>A JWST MIRI MRS View of the $\eta$ Tel Debris Disk and its Brown Dwarf Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report JWST MIRI MRS observations of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group member, $\eta$ Telescopii ($\eta$ Tel) A and its brown dwarf binary companion, $\eta$ Tel B. Following PSF subtraction, we recover the spatially resolved flux from the debris disk around $\eta$ Tel A, along with the position of the companion exterior to the disk. We present a new 5-26 $\mu$m epoch of spectroscopy for the disk, in which we discover a 20 $\mu$m silicate feature. We also present the first ever 11-21 $\mu$m spectrum of $\eta$ Tel B, which indicates a bare photosphere. We derive a new epoch of relative astrometry for the companion, extending the baseline of measurements to 25 years, and find that its current location is consistent with the apocentre of an eccentric, long-period orbit. The companion's orbit is close enough to the disk that it should significantly perturb the planetesimals within it, resulting in a detectable mid-IR pericentre glow and near-alignment with the companion. Contrary to expectations, however, we find that the disk appears to be axisymmetric and potentially misaligned with the companion in the MIRI MRS data. We posit that this may be due to the presence of an additional, yet-undetected 0.7-30 $M_J$ planet orbiting interior to the disk with a semi-major axis of 3-19 au.</description>

      <title>The JWST/NIRISS Deep Spectroscopic Survey for Young Brown Dwarfs and Free-Floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.</description>

      <title>AstroSat and Insight-HXMT observations of the long-period X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the timing and spectral studies of the accreting X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54 using astrosat and hxmt observations taken in 2016 and 2020 respectively. X-ray pulsations from the system are detected by both missions. The astrosat discovered a significant periodic signal at $\sim 5619$ s in 2016 and hxmt found a pulsation period at $\sim 5291$ s in 2020. A comparison of its spin-period evolution with the present spin-period estimates shows that the neutron star in 4U 2206+54 now has recently undergoing a spin-up episode after attaining to its slow pulsations of ~5750~s around 2015 from its prolonged spin-down phase. The present average spin-up rate of the pulsar is found to be at $\sim1.2\times10^{-13}$ Hz~s$^{-1}$. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1-60\kev could be explained with a high energy cutoff power-law continuum model, no evident line features are found with astrosat. The application of Comptonization models such as comptt and compmag to the phase averaged spectra of 4U 2206+54 reveal a hotter source photon region near the pulsar with an emission size extending to $\sim 2-2.8$~km. Using the quasi-spherical settling accretion theory, we explain the present spin-up and the possibility of strong magnetic field of the pulsar.</description>
