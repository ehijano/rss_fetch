      <title>The geometric bookkeeping guide to Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on three improvements in the context of Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations: Firstly, we show that with a specific choice of prefactors, we trivialise the $\varepsilon$-dependence of the integration-by-parts identities. Secondly, we observe that with a specific choice of order relation in the Laporta algorithm, we directly obtain a basis of master integrals, whose differential equation on the maximal cut is in Laurent polynomial form with respect to $\varepsilon$ and compatible with a particular filtration. Thirdly, we prove that such a differential equation can always be transformed to an $\varepsilon$-factorised form. This provides a systematic algorithm to obtain an $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation for any Feynman integral. Furthermore, the choices for the prefactors and the order relation significantly improve the efficiency of the reduction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Chiral interactions of fermions and massive gauge fields in Kaluza-Klein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Kaluza-Klein theory, gauge fields on $M_4$ arise as components of a higher-dimensional metric defined on $M_4 \times K$. The traditional expectation is that all the gauge fields of the Standard Model are linked to exact Killing vector fields on the internal space. This paper questions that assumption and investigates the properties of 4D gauge fields linked to non-Killing fields on $K$. It is shown that they have massive yet arbitrarily light bosons; they can mix fermions with different masses; and they can have asymmetric couplings to left- and right-handed fermions. None of these properties is easily satisfied by gauge fields linked to internal isometries. So the massive gauge fields produced in this manner circumvent traditional no-go arguments and offer a geometric source of chiral interactions with fermions. This may help to model the weak force within the Kaluza-Klein framework. Technically, the paper uses the language of spin geometry and Riemannian submersions. It studies the higher-dimensional Dirac operator with non-trivial background metrics. The results are derived for a general $K$. They are illustrated explicitly in the simpler cases where $K$ is the two-sphere and the two-torus.</description>

      <title>Chiral algebra correlators of the $6$d, $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory with a defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of $2$-point correlation functions of $\tfrac{1}{2}$-BPS operators in the $6$d, $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory in the presence of a surface defect. We focus on the protected sector described by the chiral algebra and reproduce its correlators using a bootstrap approach. A unique feature of this calculation is that we can completely determine the answer by using bulk-channel data only. We, also, perform the operator expansion in the defect channel which provide new predictions for the theory.</description>

      <title>Critical scaling for spectral functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study real-time scalar $\phi^4$-theory in 2+1 dimensions near criticality. Specifically, we compute the single-particle spectral function and that of the $s$-channel four-point function in and outside the scaling regime. The computation is done with the spectral functional Callan-Symanzik equation, which exhibits manifest Lorentz invariance and preserves causality. We extract the scaling exponent $\eta$ from the spectral function and compare our result with that from a Euclidean fixed point analysis.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that both global and gauge subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the underlying gauge subsystem symmetries, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond gauge symmetries, we also identify global subsystem symmetries, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.</description>

      <title>$x-y$ swap for $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of 2D gravity -- ``matrix model'' duality on the example of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. We propose a reformulation of the duality, related to a more conventional one by ``$x-y$ swap'' in the language of topological recursion. This formulation elucidates some conceptual and technical difficulties in the dictionary of the duality and relation to other examples. In particular, it allows to circumvent the necessity to use ``resonance transformations'', that were previously introduced to match the worldsheet and ``matrix model'' correlators, and the expressions for minimal string amplitudes in this approach are reminiscent of the ones obtained recently for ``complex Liouville string'' theory. Using this new approach, we also formulate a conjecture on how one can compute amplitudes with operators other than tachyons in the dual theory.</description>

      <title>JT de Sitter Gravity as a Model of Coleman-de Luccia Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We interpret the Euclidean solution of JT de Sitter gravity as the Coleman-de Luccia instanton for the decay of the low-entropy horizon of its static patch solution into either a Big Crunch or an infinite-entropy Lorentzian de Sitter cosmology. As in previous work by one of the authors, the Big Crunch is interpreted as bounding the entropy of the static state. The principle of detailed balance then guarantees it will transition back to a higher entropy causal diamond in the expanding cosmology. We then construct a family of explicit quantum mechanical models and appropriate metastable states, with transition probabilities well approximated by the semi-classical calculations in JT de Sitter gravity.</description>

      <title>Effect of non-conformal deformation on the gapped quasinormal modes and its holographic implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral curve of quasinormal modes for a massive real scalar field in the background of a non-conformal black brane geometry has been obtained by utilizing a Frobenius type near-horizon expansion. The gauge/gravity duality maps this to the computation of spectral curve of a scalar operator $\mathcal{O}_{\phi}$ with conformal dimension $\Delta_{\phi}$ for a large-$N$ conformal field theory with irrelevant type non-conformal deformation. In this context, non-conformality has been holographically introduced by using the Einstein-dilaton theory with Liouville type dilaton potential as the bulk theory. It has been observed that the obtained quasinormal modes are characterized by specific gapped dispersion relations. The pole-skipping points have also been computed and classified based upon different dispersion relations satisfied by them. The effect of non-conformality is evident from these results. Analytic form of the mentioned gapped dispersion relation have been obtained in the long wavelength limit by setting the mass of the scalar field to zero. The coefficients appearing in the momenta of the dispersion relation also captures the signature of non-conformal deformation. The radius of convergence of the derivative expansion in the momentum space is then computed from the critical points of the spectral curve. It has been observed that presence of non-conformality increases the domain of applicability for the derivative expansion in momentum space, as it increases the radius of convergence for a given conformal dimension. The comparison between the convergence radii and the absolute momenta corresponding to lowest order pole-skipping points also leads to some interesting findings.</description>

      <title>Holography for QCD(Adj) and QCD(Adj)+F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in SU(Nc) gauge theories with fermions in the adjoint representation. There has been considerable work on studying these theories compactified on a small circle (with compactification scale 1/L large relative to the strong coupling scale of the theory). The weakly coupled IR theory of photons exhibits confinement through a density of magnetically charged instanton configurations. As the compactification scale 1/L approaches the strong coupling scale, the IR theory becomes strongly coupled. In this regime we propose a holographic description of the IR degrees of freedom. The instanton condensation scale can be associated with a scale at which the Brietenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound is violated in the model and the glueball spectrum computed. We can also introduce the adjoint fermions which holographically display a BF bound violation associated to their running anomalous dimension. Very naively extending the perturbative results to the non-perturbative regime suggests that chiral symmetry breaking might occur ahead of confinement, but equally they may be joined phenomena. If the two phenomena are separate, then it would be useful to be able to enlarge the gap in scales. We propose adding fermions in the fundamental representation as well, which in a holographic model (that favours this separation) can greatly enlarge the gap to an order of magnitude. These results challenge the lattice community to seek such scale gaps (or their absence) to further understand the confining and chiral symmetry breaking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Holographic D-brane constructions with dynamical gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic D-brane constructions, governed by the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action, play a central role in the AdS/CFT correspondence, particularly in applications to quantum chromodynamics and condensed matter systems. In this work, we demonstrate how to equip these bottom-up holographic models with dynamical boundary gauge fields, thereby introducing electromagnetic interactions into their dual field theory descriptions. As a direct application of this formalism, we compute the dispersion relations of the lowest quasinormal modes around both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states, and show that their behavior matches the predictions from hydrodynamics with dynamical $U(1)$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study new black hole solutions in quantum gravity. We use the Vilkovisky-DeWitt unique effective action to obtain quantum gravitational corrections to Einstein's equations. In full analogy to previous work done for quadratic gravity, we find new black hole like solutions. We show that these new solutions exist close to the horizon and in the far-field limit.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating strings and quantum effects in two-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is expected that when the string coupling is taken to be sufficiently small, a black hole turns into a bound state of self-gravitating fundamental strings. This state would be described by winding strings wrapping around the Euclidean time circle, known as the Horowitz-Polchinski solution. In this paper, we study such a self-gravitating string configuration in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. We first derive an analytic expression of the solution describing a winding string in two-dimensions and investigate in detail the geometry of this solution. Our winding string solution in two dimensions describes the geometry near the surface of the bound state of self-gravitating strings in the large-dimension limit, much like a two-dimensional black hole describes the near horizon geometry of the Schwarzschild black hole in the large-dimension limit. To study quantum effects around self-gravitating strings, we also obtain an analytic solution of winding strings in the RST model. In a similar fashion to the Hartle-Hawking vacuum around a black hole, our string solution in the RST model contains the background radiation, whose temperature is the same as that of the winding strings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sometimes a local minimum is known to be a metastable vacuum inside the low-energy EFT, but the true vacuum lies outside, and the bounce solution mediating the decay cannot be found. For single-field decay, Espinosa has proposed a family of configurations called ``pseudo-bounces'' as a way to constrain the decay rate. They are parametrized by the central field value $\Phi_0$ and constructed without the knowledge of the true vacuum. We prove that the pseudo-bounce family has a monotonically decreasing decay exponent whose end point and minimum is the bounce action, and this continues to hold when gravitational effects are non-negligible. We then use this to estimate the decay rate (in the radion direction) of the promised AdS$_3$ vacuum of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Off-shell double copy theories in BV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of the double copy for gauge theories that exhibit off-shell color-kinematics duality within the Batalin-Vilkovitsky (BV) formalism. As illustrative examples, we consider the double copies of Chern-Simons theory, four-dimensional BF theory, and two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, and we discuss possible gravity interpretations for these cases. We formalize the construction and demonstrate that Kodaira-Spencer gravity, K\"ahler gravity, and their generalizations, fit naturally within this framework. In particular, Kodaira-Spencer gravity emerges as a gauge theory describing deformations of generalized complex structures, while the double copy of Chern-Simons theory captures the deformation of the Courant bracket.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Gravity with Crossing Symmetric Dispersion Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive bounds on Wilson coefficients in gravitational effective field theories using fully crossing symmetric dispersion relations. These sum rules naturally isolate finite subsets of low-energy couplings without relying on the forward limit or specific high-energy completions. We validate our method by matching bounds computed previously for scalar scattering with gravity as well as for supergraviton scattering. For graviton scattering we use crossing symmetric functions that combine various helicity combinations for the maximal-helicity violating amplitude and find stronger bounds than have been previously computed. We also derive new bounds on the coupling of gravitons to a massive spin-4 state at tree level. These results demonstrate the power of crossing symmetric sum rules as a tool in the S-matrix bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Collapse Scenario and Final State of Evaporation for Schwarzschild Black Hole in Dimensionally-Reduced Model of Dilaton Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of (1+1)-dimensional dilaton gravity derived from the four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action by dimensional reduction in a semiclassical approximation including back-reaction. The reduced action involves the cosmological constant and admits black hole solutions; among these, the solutions of interest are the evaporating black holes. We solve the equations of motion perturbatively by demanding that the initial state geometry is a Minkowski space-time. When the infalling matter intersects the space-time boundary, the black hole forms and begins to evaporate. We find that as the black hole evaporates, its horizon shrinks and at a finite space-time point, it meets the singularity and a shockwave occurs. Along this hypersurface, the metric can be continuously matched to a static end-state geometry. This end-state geometry is Minkowski space-time within the first-order of perturbation theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulae for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ class $\mathcal{S}$ theories and corresponding BPS quivers, including those of wild type, as identities for generating series of symmetric quivers that represent dualities of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ boundary theories. We identify such symmetric quivers for both sides of the wall-crossing formulae. In the finite chamber such a quiver is captured by the symmetrized BPS quiver, whereas on the other side of the wall we find an infinite quiver with an intricate pattern of arrows and loops. Invoking diagonalization, for $m$-Kronecker quivers we find a wall-crossing type formula involving trees of unlinkings that expresses closed Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the corresponding 4d theories in terms of open Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the 3d theories and invariants of $m$-loop quivers. Using this formula, we determine a number of closed Donaldson-Thomas invariants of wild type.</description>

      <title>Caustic fringes for wave dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>The Primakoff effect: axion-photon mixing in the context of axion electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose in this work the study of the production of axions in stellar plasma medium through an external magnetic field. In the background field approximation, we can show that the presence of the external magnetic field induces a mixing between the photon and the axion, i.e. the so called Primakoff effect. Since the axion is one of the greatest candidates for dark matter, for being a neutral pseudo-scalar field, the Primakoff process constitutes a mechanism (or portal) to access the dark sector, which in turn provides us new perspectives beyond the standard model. In the high energies limit, observables like probabilities transitions and particles production rates were computed.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators: A Journey From Theory to Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collider experiments offer a unique opportunity to explore the Standard Model (SM), and to search for new physics, new interactions, and new principles of nature. The theoretical abstraction of a collider, namely the study of correlations in asymptotic fluxes, provides one of the most basic examples of an observable in quantum field theory (QFT) and quantum gravity. Energy flux is described in QFT by energy flow operators, a particular example of light-ray operators. In addition to their central role in the theoretical description of collider physics, energy flow operators play an important role in diverse areas of formal QFT and gravity, providing a connection between real world collider phenomenology, and the deep underlying principles of QFT.
  Recently it has become possible to measure correlation functions of energy flow operators in a wide variety of collider experiments, providing an exciting new connection between collider physics and formal theory. In this review, we provide a survey of recent progress in our understanding of energy operators and their correlators, highlighting their importance in both formal theory and collider phenomenology, and in particular, their great potential for bridging these areas to provide new ways to understand the real world. We intend this article as a resource for both formal theorists interested in understanding how light-ray operators are being applied in particle and nuclear physics, as well as for experimentalists interested in the theoretical motivation for these observables. Most importantly, we aim to stimulate further interaction between the formal, phenomenological and experimental communities through the common lens of energy correlators.</description>

      <title>"Symmetry-from-Anomaly" in Condensed Matter related Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The noninvertible axial symmetry constructed from the ABJ-anomaly has attracted enormous interest. We discuss the mechanism of "symmetry-from-anomaly" in condensed matter-related models in both 1d and 3d spaces (which correspond to (1+1)d and (3+1)d space-time). Within the models discussed here, we establish the connection between field theory quantities such as different versions of the axial charge, and quantities with simple physical meanings in our systems. In our models and likely a class of related constructions, the existence of a topological order is necessary for the purpose of properly defining the axial symmetry. But the proper axial symmetry we define, though requires a topological order, is different from the noninvertible axial symmetry discussed in recent proposals.</description>

      <title>Light PIDM in Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Planckian Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM), which interacts exclusively through gravity, typically requires heavy DM candidates (with mass $10^3-10^{15}$ GeV) and very high reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 10^{15}$ GeV). In this article, we explore a novel realization of PIDM in warped five-dimensions, consisting of an "Ultra Violet"$-$"Dark"$-$"Infra Red" (UV-DB-IR) brane setup, where the DM can be a Dark brane composite light state with mass 1 MeV $-$ 1 TeV. The DM sector is assumed to interact solely via gravity in five-dimensions. After orbifolding and performing a Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, the DM is assumed to be localized onto the DB, which is positioned in the extra-dimension such that the DM interacts with both the massless graviton and its massive KK excitations, with suppressed couplings to remain consistent with the ethos of the PIDM framework. The light (heavy) Standard Model matter is assumed to be localized near UV (IR) branes for the geometric Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, while their KK modes are localized close to the IR brane. We show that this construction allows for a viable and efficient freeze-in production mechanism for light composite PIDM, consistent with TeV-scale reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Freezing-in Cannibals with Low-reheating Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The freeze-in mechanism provides a compelling framework for dark matter (DM) production, particularly suited to scenarios involving feeble interactions with the Standard Model (SM). In this work, we highlight a possible interplay of a non-instantaneous reheating phase and dark sector self-interactions, specifically $2 \to 3$ and $3 \to 2$ cannibalization processes. As an example we study the freeze-in production of a complex scalar DM candidate stabilized by a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry permitting cubic self-couplings, enabling number-changing interactions that drive internal thermalization and significantly modify the dark sector number density and temperature evolution. We numerically solve the coupled Boltzmann equations for the DM number density and temperature alongside the evolving SM bath, accurately capturing the dynamics of a prolonged reheating epoch. Our analysis reveals a rich and distinctive phenomenology arising from the interplay between the Universe's thermal history, Higgs portal mediated production, and cannibalistic self-interactions. Compared to scenarios with instantaneous reheating or negligible self-interactions, our framework opens new viable regions in parameter space, particularly for light DM, potentially within reach of future probes.</description>

      <title>(2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of Quarkonia: A Possible Probe of a Deconfined QCD matter in Heavy-ion Collisions at TeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of deconfined QCD matter on quarkonium spin alignment in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We estimate the spin alignment of charmonium ($J/\psi$, and $\psi$(2S)) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$(1S), and $\Upsilon$(2S)) states by calculating the energy eigenvalues in a thermal rotating medium. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation with a medium-modified color-singlet potential considering the coupling of spin with vorticity and magnetic field. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of medium temperature, vorticity, magnetic field, and momentum-space anisotropy on the elements of the spin density matrix. Our findings reveal that vorticity increases the spin alignment, while the magnetic fields and anisotropy modify the observables in a state-dependent manner. These findings deepen our understanding of quarkonium spin alignment in an anisotropic magneto-vortical thermal medium, shedding light on spin transport phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Higher Chiral Algebras in a Polysimplicial Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertex algebras are equivalent to translation-equivariant chiral algebras on $\mathbb{A}^1$, in the sense of Beilinson and Drinfeld. In this paper we give an algebraic construction of a chiral algebra on $\mathbb{A}^n$; this can be seen as an algebraic construction of a higher-dimensional vertex algebra.
  We introduce a model, in dg commutative algebras, of the derived algebra of functions on the configuration space of $k$ distinct labelled marked points in $\mathbb{A}^n$. Working in this model -- which we call the polysimplicial model -- we obtain a dg operad of chiral operations on a degree-shifted copy of the canonical sheaf. We prove that there is a quasi-isomorphism, to this dg operad, from the Lie-infinity operad. This result makes the shifted canonical sheaf into a first example of a homotopy polysimplicial chiral algebra on $\mathbb{A}^n$, in a sense which generalizes to higher dimensions Malikov and Schechtman's notion of a homotopy chiral algebra.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) give an access to timelike gravitational form factors (GFFs) which are complementary to the spacelike ones which can be deduced from the hadronic generalized parton distributions (GPDs) measured in deep exclusive electroproduction processes. They allow to probe the GFFs of unstable baryons in the baryon octet, since the second moments of hadronic generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) lead to the timelike GFFs. These GDAs can be measured in the process $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$, in the generalized Bjorken regime where the invariant mass of the $B \bar{B}$ pair is near threshold at high energy facilities, such as BESIII, Belle II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility. In this work, we investigate this process using the QCD collinear factorization framework, where the scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of the baryon timelike electromagnetic (EM) FFs and Compton FFs. We also provide a numerical estimate of the cross sections with a model for baryon-antibaryon GDAs. Our work provides us a possibility to extract the timelike baryon GFFs from near future experimental measurements, and these GFFs may be further used to study longstanding questions in hadronic physics such as the baryon spin decomposition and D-term.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal spectra of a wormhole family: overtone features and a parameter-controlled redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though investigated extensively in the past, we take a detailed relook at the study of quasinormal modes (QNM) in a known family of wormholes (ultrastatic ($g_{00}=-1$), as well as spacetimes with different, non-constant $g_{00}$), which includes the familiar Bronnikov-Ellis spacetime as a special case. Our focus here is to go beyond the fundamental mode and obtain some of the QNM overtones using a suitable numerical scheme. Scalar and axial gravitational QNMs including two or three overtones are obtained for the family of ultrastatic geometries and their parameter dependencies are shown explicitly. Further, we comment on how (a) the overtones may influence the time-domain profile in a perturbation and (b) in what sense, the use of overtones may help in distinguishing between different geometries within the family.
  Finally, we show how an effect somewhat similar to the so-called `environment induced redshift' of QNMs, introduced recently (arXiv:2412.18651), may be obtained for spacetimes with non-constant $g_{00}$, via an appropriate tuning of available metric parameters which systematically modify the shapes of the effective potentials arising in the perturbation equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we consider the effect of Radon or X-ray transformations, on the Laplace eigenfunctions in hyperbolic Bolyai-Lobachevsky space. We show that the Radon map from this space to Lorentzian-signature Anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space is easier to interpret if we use the Poincare disc model and eigenfunctions rather than the upper-half-plane model. In particular, this version of the transform reveals the geometric origin of the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions that are involved in calculating the SYK four-point function.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</description>

      <title>Universality of scaling entropy in charged hadron multiplicity distributions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the scaling behavior of the entropy associated with the charged hadron multiplicity distribution P(N) in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the growth of this entropic indicator as a function of the Bjorken x variable exhibits a universal behavior, consistent with observations from deep inelastic scattering (DIS). This universality suggests that the entropy scaling is a property of the initial state and reflects the diffusive nature of gluon dynamics at small x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-multiplicity events are not accurately described by traditional KNO scaling and require a more precise description based on a diffusion scaling framework. This new scaling emerges naturally from the universal growth of partonic entropy and offers a deeper insight into the dynamics of particle production in high-energy hadronic collisions.</description>

      <title>Electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$ meson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the Standard Model is accompanied by a new pseudo-scalar degree of freedom, $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson, which cancels the topological susceptibility of the electroweak vacuum and gets its mass from this effect. The prediction is based on the analyticity properties of the Chern-Simons correlator combined with the basic features of gravity. Depending on the quality level of the $U(1)_{B+L}$-symmetry, $\eta_{\rm w}$ emerges as a $B+L$ pseudo-Goldstone boson or as a St\"uckelberg $2$-form of the electroweak gauge redundancy. An intriguing scenario of the first category is the emergence of $\eta_{\rm w}$ in the form of the phase of a $U(1)_{B+L}$-violating fermion condensate triggered by the instantons, somewhat similar to $\eta'$-meson in QCD. Regardless of its origin, the presence of $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson in the theory appears to be a matter of consistency.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius ($M-R$) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding $2M_{\odot}$.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals exhibit linear resistivity and anomalous Hall transport, yet a comprehensive theory that accounts for both phenomena is still lacking. Recent studies have shown SYK-like spatially random couplings between a Fermi surface and a bosonic field, either scalar or vector type, can yield linear-$T$ resistivity. In this paper, we continue the investigation on a vector coupling in the presence of a magnetic field. We compute the fermion and boson propagators, along with the self-energy and polarization functions, and determine their dependence on the magnetic field. Although the Hall angle does not exhibit the signature of strange-metal, the linear-in-temperature resistivity remains at low temperatures. Results indicate that random interactions can robustly support linear transport, though additional ingredients may be required to capture the full phenomenology of strange metals.</description>

      <title>Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum knot invariants (like colored HOMFLY-PT or Kauffman polynomials) are a distinguished class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them (via Chern-Simons theory or quantum R-matrix) starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. Another set of knot invariants - of finite type - is related to quantum invariants via a perturbative expansion. However can all finite type invariants be obtained in this way? Investigating this problem, P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. Then it is easy to construct a polynomial $P_{alg}$ that vanishes for all simple Lie algebras, and the corresponding Vassiliev invariant would thus be absent from the perturbative expansion.
  We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebras might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie algebras - when we start from knot invariants and arrive at Lie algebras and their classification, which is opposite to conventional logic that we mentioned at the beginning.</description>

Abstract: We consider Lovelock gravity in arbitrary, even dimensions. We find a large class of new gravitational instantons by considering extended nontrivial circle bundles over K\"ahler manifolds. Concretely, we generalize the Page-Pope metric in the presence of higher-curvature corrections of the Lovelock class. A subset of these spaces admits analytic continuation into the Lorentzian sector, producing new stationary solutions in Lovelock gravity. The geometries are fully determined by a single algebraic equation. We also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for Lovelock-constant K\"ahler manifolds to exist in Lovelock gravity. Finally, we find a wide class of Lovelock-Maxwell solutions beyond staticity, allowing us to obtain the electrovacuum extension of these instantons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String-localized QFT allows to explain Standard Model interactions in an autonomous way, committed to quantum principles rather than a "gauge principle", thus avoiding an indefinite state space and compensating ghosts. The resulting perturbative scattering matrix is known (at tree-level) to be insensitive to the non-locality of the auxiliary "string-localized fields" used in the construction. For the examples of Yang-Mills and QCD, we prove that it is actually equivalent to the perturbative S-matrix of gauge theory, restricted to physical particle states. The role of classical gauge invariance is revealed along the way. The main tool are "dressed fields", that are intermediate between free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit formulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as non-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility, enabled by our approach, that qualitative traces of confinement may be visible already at the level of the dressed fields.</description>

Abstract: A Lagrange multiplier field can be used to restrict radiative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action to one-loop order. This result is employed to show that it is possible to couple a scalar field to the metric (graviton) field in such a way that the model is both renormalizable and unitary. The usual Einstein equations of motion for the gravitational field are recovered, perturbatively, in the classical limit. By evaluating the generating functional of proper Green's functions in closed form, one obtains a novel analytic contribution to the effective action.</description>

Abstract: We construct an infinite family of semiclassical de Sitter (dS) microstates, realized as backreacted geometries of dS spacetime with a constant tension thin-shell brane located outside the dS event horizon. The contribution of wormholes in semiclassical gravitational path integral computations of overlaps between these microstates implies that they are not fully orthogonal. We count the dimension of the Hilbert space spanned by these dS microstates and find that it equals the exponential of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the de Sitter spacetime. Our construction provides a gravitational states counting derivation of Gibbons-Hawking formula for dS entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent z. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of Krylov complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two classes of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources are presented. The asymptotic regime is extracted, with attention to quasilocal gravitational energy, shear and angular momentum related by the Raychaudhuri equation. At outer boundaries the quasilocal angular momentum and energy densities vanish, defining novel geometric structures - the vortex surface and the rotosurface. Solutions with a rotosurface present a new notion of asymptotic flatness: vorticity, shear and Kretschmann scalars vanish at a finite radial distance from the symmetry centre. Synthetic rotation curves for the Milky Way are presented, fit to GAIA-DR3 data, and potential astrophysical signatures are suggested. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We construct a local universal Mumford form on a product of Sato Grassmannians using the flow of the Virasoro algebra. The existence of this universal Mumford form furthers the proposal that the Sato Grassmannian provides a universal moduli space with applications to string theory. Our approach using the Virasoro flow is an alternative to using the KP flow, which in particular allows for a bosonic universal Mumford form to be constructed. Applying the same method, we construct a local universal super Mumford form on a product of super Sato Grassmannians using the flow of the Neveu-Schwarz algebra.</description>

Abstract: In 1987, Albert Schwarz suggested a formula which extends the super Mumford form from the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces into the super Sato Grassmannian. His formula is a remarkably simple combination of super tau functions. We compute the Neveu-Schwarz action on super tau functions, and show that Schwarz's extended Mumford form is invariant under the the super Heisenberg-Neveu-Schwarz action, which strengthens Schwarz's proposal that a locus within the Grassmannian can serve as a universal moduli space with applications to superstring theory. Along the way, we construct the Neveu-Schwarz, super Witt, and super Heisenberg formal groups.</description>

Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>

Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>
