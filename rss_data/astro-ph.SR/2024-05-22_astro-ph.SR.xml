      <title>Exploring the directly imaged HD 1160 system through spectroscopic characterisation and high-cadence variability monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time variability and spectra of directly imaged companions provide insight into their physical properties and atmospheric dynamics. We present follow-up R~40 spectrophotometric monitoring of red companion HD 1160 B at 2.8-4.2 $\mu$m using the double-grating 360{\deg} vector Apodizing Phase Plate (dgvAPP360) coronagraph and ALES integral field spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. We use the recently developed technique of gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry to produce differential light curves for HD 1160 B. We reproduce the previously reported ~3.2 h periodic variability in archival data, but detect no periodic variability in new observations taken the following night with a similar 3.5% level precision, suggesting rapid evolution in the variability of HD 1160 B. We also extract complementary spectra of HD 1160 B for each night. The two are mostly consistent, but the companion appears fainter on the second night between 3.0-3.2 $\mu$m. Fitting models to these spectra produces different values for physical properties depending on the night considered. We find an effective temperature T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2794$^{+115}_{-133}$ K on the first night, consistent with the literature, but a cooler T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2279$^{+79}_{-157}$ K on the next. We estimate the mass of HD 1160 B to be 16-81 M$_{\text{Jup}}$, depending on its age. We also present R = 50,000 high-resolution optical spectroscopy of host star HD 1160 A obtained simultaneously with the PEPSI spectrograph. We reclassify its spectral type to A1 IV-V and measure its projected rotational velocity v sin i = 96$^{+6}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus highlight that gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry can achieve repeatable few percent level precision and does not yet reach a systematic noise floor, suggesting greater precision is achievable with additional data or advanced detrending techniques.</description>

      <title>A Model for Eruptive Mass Loss in Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well-understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a locally super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with masses $10-100~M_\odot$ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to $\sim10^{-2}~M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the HR diagram between $3.5 \lesssim \log(T_\mathrm{eff}/\mathrm{K}) \lesssim 4.0$. This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses $\gtrsim20~M_\odot$ from evolving to become red supergiants, with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and therefore offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of red supergiants in that mass regime.</description>

      <title>Verification of astrometrically accelerating stars from Hipparcos and Gaia: I. Methodology and application to HIP 44842</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large number of candidate binary stars with apparent acceleration on the sky has emerged from analysis of astrometric data collected by the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, and Gaia space missions. Although the apparent acceleration can serve as a relatively reliable indicator of binarity, it provides scarce information about the orbital and physical parameters of the components. With an emphasis on the search for stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars hidden in binary systems, we start a broader effort to characterize the most promising candidates using follow-up ground-based observations. Accurate quantification of orbital and physical parameters of systems with dim or invisible companions requires combination of Hipparcos, Gaia, and precision spectroscopic measurements. In this paper, we review the necessary steps in this implementation and describe the improved Hipparcos-Gaia sample of long-term astrometric accelerations which includes correction of sky-correlated systematic errors using the vector spherical decomposition method. As an example, we study one Hipparcos star with a large acceleration, HIP 44842, where the companion is revealed to be a normal main sequence star.</description>

      <title>A New Asteroseismic $\textit{Kepler}$ Benchmark Constrains the Onset of Weakened Magnetic Braking in Mature Sun-Like Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar spin down is a critical yet poorly understood component of stellar evolution. In particular, results from the Kepler Mission imply that mature age, solar-type stars have inefficient magnetic braking, resulting in a stalled spin down rate. However, a large number of precise asteroseismic ages are needed for mature ($\geq$ 3Gyr) stars in order to probe the regime where traditional and stalled spin-down models differ. In this paper, we present a new asteroseismic benchmark star for gyrochronology discovered using reprocessed Kepler short cadence data. KIC 11029516 (Papayu) is a bright ($K_{p}$ = 9.6 mag) solar-type star with well-measured rotation period (21.1$\pm$0.8 days) from spot modulation using 4 years of Kepler long cadence data. We combine asteroseismology and spectroscopy to obtain $T_{eff}=5888\pm100$ K, $\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.30 \pm 0.06\,$ dex, $M = 1.24 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$, $R = 1.34 \pm 0.02 R_{\odot}$ and age of 4.0 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr, making Papayu one of the most similar stars to the Sun in terms of temperature and radius with an asteroseismic age and a rotation period measured from spot modulation. We find that Papayu sits at the transition of where traditional and weakened spin-down models diverge. A comparison with stars of similar zero-age main-sequence temperatures supports previous findings that weakened spin-down models are required to explain the ages and rotation periods of old solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>iSHELL $K$-band Survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum Sources: Magnetic field measurements in the protostellar phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first magnetic field strength survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum (FS) sources using $K$-band observations with iSHELL. We obtained new observations of 42 Class I and FS sources and additionally included 10 sources from the archive. We detect photospheric lines in 44 of the sources, in addition to Br$\gamma$, H$_2$, and CO emission in several objects. We model the photospheric absorption lines of 32 Class I and FS sources and measure their magnetic field strengths, $K$-band temperatures, gravities, projected rotational velocities, and infrared veiling values. We put the physical properties of Class I and FS sources in context by comparing them to the values derived for a sample of Class II sources. We find that a) the average magnetic field strength of Class I and FS sources $\langle B \rangle=2.0\pm0.15$ kG is consistent with the average magnetic field strength of Class II sources $\langle B \rangle=1.8\pm0.15$ kG, and b) the average gravity of Class I and FS objects $\log{g}=3.43\pm0.07$ is lower than the average gravity of Class II sources $\log{g}=3.75\pm0.04$, although there is significant overlap between both gravity distributions. Furthermore, using stellar evolutionary models, we deduce that Class I and FS sources have a median age of $\sim$0.6 Myr, and are, as a group, younger than the Class II stars with a median age of $\sim$3 Myr. Our results confirm that Class I and FS sources host strong magnetic fields on their photospheres. Thus, it is likely that these sources accrete disk material through a magnetosphere similar to the more evolved T Tauri stars.</description>

      <title>BSN: First Photometric Light Curve Analysis of Two W-type Contact Binary Systems OP Boo and V0511 Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presented the first light curve analysis of the OP Boo and V0511 Cam binary stars, which was conducted in the frame of the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project. Photometric ground-based observations were conducted with standard filters at two observatories in the Czech Republic. We computed a new ephemeris for each of the systems using our extracted times of minima, TESS data, and additional literature. Linear fits for O-C diagrams of both systems were considered using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The light curves were analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary code combined with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The light curve solutions of both target systems required a cold starspot. The absolute parameters of the systems were calculated by using a P-M parameter relationship. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR), P-L, logMtot-logJ0, and T-M diagrams. The second component in both systems is determined to be a more massive and hotter star. Therefore, it can be concluded that both systems are W-type contact binary systems.</description>

      <title>Solar wind data analysis aided by synthetic modeling: a better understanding of plasma-frame variations from temporal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-situ measurements of the solar wind, a turbulent and anisotropic plasma flow originating at the Sun, are mostly carried out by single spacecraft, resulting in one-dimensional time series. The conversion of these measurements to the spatial frame of the plasma is a great challenge, but required for direct comparison of the measurements with MHD turbulence theories. Here we present a toolkit, based on the synthetic modeling of solar wind fluctuations as two-dimensional noise maps with adjustable spectral and power anisotropy, that can help with the temporal-spatial conversion of real data. Specifically, by following the spacecraft trajectory through a noise map (relative velocity and angle relative to some mean magnetic field) with properties tuned to mimic those of the solar wind, the likelihood that the temporal data fluctuations represent parallel or perpendicular fluctuations in the plasma frame can be quantified by correlating structure functions of the noise map. Synthetic temporal data can also be generated, which can provide a testing ground for analysis applied to the solar wind data. We demonstrate this tool by investigating Parker Solar Probe's E7 trajectory and data, and showcase several possible ways in which it can be used. We find that whether temporal variations in the spacecraft frame come from parallel or perpendicular variations in the plasma frame strongly depends on the spectral and power anisotropy of the measured wind. Data analysis assisted by such underlying synthetic models as presented here could open up new ways to interpret measurements in the future, specifically in the more reliable determination of plasma frame quantities from temporal measurements.</description>

      <title>Investigating stellar wind dynamics of WR135: A pulsating WC8-type star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high-frequency pulsations in WR135 from short cadence optical photometric and spectroscopic time series surveys. The harmonics up to $6^{th}$ order are detected from the integrated photometric flux variation while the comparatively weaker $8^{th}$ harmonic is detected from the varying strengths of the least blended emission lines. We investigate the atmospheric stratification of the stellar winds of WR135 using a radiative transfer modeling code, CMFGEN, and find the physical conditions that can support the propagation of such pulsations. From our study, we find that the sub-sonic layers of the atmosphere are close to the Eddington limit and are launched by the Fe-opacity. While the outer optically thin super-sonic winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.1-0.01) are driven by the He II and C IV opacities. The stratified winds above the sonic point undergo velocity perturbation that can lead to clumps. We find that the optically thin supersonic winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.1-0.01) contain dense smaller clumps (f=0.2-0.3) that oscillate under the higher-order harmonics of the pulsation. These clumps grow larger (f=0.1), dominate the outer stellar winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.01-0.001), and oscillate under the lower-order harmonics.</description>

      <title>Future Prospects for Partially Ionised Solar Plasmas: the Prominence Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially ionised plasmas (PIP) constitute an essential ingredient of our plasma universe. Historically, the physical effects associated with partial ionisation were considered in astrophysical topics such as the interstellar medium, molecular clouds, accretion disks and, later on, in solar physics. PIP can be found in layers of the Sun's atmosphere as well as in solar structures embedded within it. As a consequence, the dynamical behaviour of these layers and structures is influenced by the different physical effects introduced by partial ionisation.
  Here, rather than considering an exhaustive discussion of partially ionised effects in the different layers and structures of the solar atmosphere, we focus on solar prominences. The reason is that they represent a paradigmatic case of a partially ionised solar plasma, confined and insulated by the magnetic field, constituting an ideal environment to study the effects induced by partial ionisation. We present the current knowledge about the effects of partial ionisation in the global stability, mass cycle and dynamics of solar prominences. We revise the identified observational signatures of partial ionisation in prominences. We conclude with prospects for PIP research in prominences, proposing the path for advancing in the prominence modelling and theory and using new and upcoming instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the (re-)orientation of star-disk systems through infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been consensus that star-disk systems accrete most of their mass and angular momentum during the collapse of a prestellar core, such that the rotational direction of a system is equivalent to the net rotation of the core. Recent results, however, indicate that stars experience post-collapse or late infall, during which the star and its disk is refreshed with material from the protostellar environment through accretion streamers. Apart from adding mass to the star-disk system, infall potentially supplies a substantial amount of angular momentum as the infalling material is initially not bound to the collapsing prestellar core. We investigate the orientation of infall on star-disk systems by analyzing the properties of accreting tracer particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a molecular cloud that is (4 pc)$^3$ in volume. In contrast to the traditional picture, where the rotational axis is inherited from the collapse of a coherent pre-stellar core, the orientation of star-disk systems can change substantially during the accretion process. In agreement with previous results that show larger contributions of late infall for increasing stellar masses, infall is more likely to lead to a prolonged change in orientation for stars of higher final mass. On average, brown dwarfs and very low mass stars are more likely to form and accrete all of their mass as part of a multiple system, while stars with final masses above a few 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ are more likely to accrete part of their mass as single stars. Finally, we find an overall trend: the post-collapse accretion phase is more anisotropic than the early collapse phase. This result is consistent with a scenario, where mass accretion from infall occurs via infalling streamers along a preferred direction, while the initial collapse is less anisotropic albeit the fact that material is funneled through accretion channels.</description>

      <title>No signature of the birth environment of exoplanets from their host stars' Mahalanobis phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The architectures of extrasolar planetary systems often deviate considerably from the ``standard" model for planet formation, which is largely based on our own Solar System. In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some process(es) are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars. Recent research has suggested that Hot Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host Hot Jupiters. This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets. We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions. We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than non-hosts, regardless of their initial physical density. This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating. However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes. We therefore corroborate other research in this area which has suggested the high phase space of Hot Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator for Accelerating Coronal Magnetic Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the sun's outer atmosphere is challenging due to its complex magnetic fields impacting solar activities. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations help model these interactions but are extremely time-consuming (usually on a scale of days). Our research applies the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to accelerate the coronal magnetic field modeling, specifically, the Bifrost MHD model. We apply Tensorized FNO (TFNO) to generate solutions from partial differential equations (PDEs) over a 3D domain efficiently. TFNO's performance is compared with other deep learning methods, highlighting its accuracy and scalability. Physics analysis confirms that TFNO is reliable and capable of accelerating MHD simulations with high precision. This advancement improves efficiency in data handling, enhances predictive capabilities, and provides a better understanding of magnetic topologies.</description>

      <title>A conclusive non-detection of magnetic field in the Am star o Peg with high-precision near-infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The A-type metallic-line (Am) stars are typically considered to be non-magnetic or possessing very weak sub-G magnetic fields. This view has been repeatedly challenged in the literature, most commonly for the bright hot Am star o Peg. Several studies claimed to detect 1-2 kG field of unknown topology in this object, possibly indicating a new process of magnetic field generation in intermediate-mass stars. In this study, we revisit the evidence of a strong magnetic field in o Peg using new high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations and advanced spectral fitting techniques. The mean magnetic field strength in o Peg is estimated from the high-precision CRIRES+ measurement of near-infrared sulphur lines. This observation is modelled with a polarised radiative transfer code, including treatment of the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition, the least-squares deconvolution multi-line technique is employed to derive longitudinal field measurements from archival optical spectropolarimetric observations of this star. Our analysis of the near-infrared S I lines reveals no evidence of Zeeman broadening, ruling out magnetic field with a strength exceeding 260 G. This null result is compatible with the relative intensification of Fe II lines in the optical spectrum taking into account blending and uncertain atomic parameters of the relevant diagnostic transitions. Longitudinal field measurements at three different nights also yield null results with a precision of 2 G. This study refutes the claims of kG-strength dipolar or tangled magnetic field in o Peg. This star is effectively non-magnetic, with the surface magnetic field characteristics no different from those of other Am stars.</description>

      <title>Curve of Growth Analysis of SZ Lyn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present one high-resolution and a time series of 561 low-resolution follow-up spectroscopic observations of SZ Lyn. It is a high-amplitude Delta Scuti-type pulsating star in a binary system. The photometric observations reveal the existence of radial and non-radial oscillation modes in SZ Lyn. In spectroscopy, the variation of equivalent width of the line profiles reflects the temperature variations. The equivalent widths of the Balmer lines, H-alpha, H-hbeta, and H-gamma were measured over the pulsation cycle of SZ Lyn using time sequence spectra. Hence, the temperature profile of SZ Lyn was derived using the curve of growth analysis. Furthermore, the stellar parameters were determined through the best fit analysis of observed and synthetic high-resolution spectral lines. The best fit determines a model of Teff=6750 K, log(g)=3.5 dex, and vrot=10 km/s for solar abundance.</description>

      <title>A Quick Guide to Nearby Young Association</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby associations of stars which are coeval are important benchmark laboratories because they provide robust measurements of stellar ages. The study of such coeval groups makes it possible to better understand star formation by studying the initial mass function, the binary fraction or the circumstellar disks of stars, to determine how the initially dense populations of young stars gradually disperse to form the field population, and to shed light on how the properties of stars, exoplanets and substellar objects evolve with distinct snapshots along their lifetime. The advent of large-scale missions such as Gaia is reshaping our understanding or stellar kinematics in the Solar neighborhood and beyond, and offers the opportunity to detect a large number of loose, coeval stellar associations for the first time, which evaded prior detection because of their low density or the faintness of their members. In parallel, advances in detection and characterization of exoplanets and substellar objects are starting to unveil the detailed properties of extrasolar atmospheres, as well as population-level distributions in fundamental exoplanet properties such as radii, masses, and orbital parameters. Accurate ages are still sparsely available to interpret the evolution of both exoplanets and substellar objects, and both fields are now ripe for detailed age investigations because we are starting to uncover ever-closer low-density associations that previously escaped detection, as well as exoplanets and ever lower-mass members of more distant open clusters and star-forming regions. In this paper, we review some recent advances in the identification and characterization of nearby associations, the methods by which stellar ages are measured, and some of the direct applications of the study of young associations such as the emergent field of isolated planetary-mass objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way can be significantly affected by dark matter annihilation, producing population-level effects that are visible in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. We establish the dark HR diagram, where stars lie on a new stable $\textit{dark main sequence}$ with similar luminosities, but lower temperatures, than the standard main sequence. The dark matter density in these stars continuously replenishes, granting these stars immortality and solving multiple stellar anomalies. Upcoming telescopes could detect the dark main sequence, offering a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

      <title>Force-free wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres: Computational modeling in axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfv\'en waves (AWs) to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating AWs interact in the equatorial region. Alfv\'en waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, AWs convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric AW crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of `bouncing' AWs by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.</description>

      <title>In-situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits established in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Close Binary Fractions in accreted and in-situ Halo Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of binary stars in the Galactic halo provides crucial insights into the dynamical history and formation processes of the Milky Way. In this work, we aim to investigate the binary fraction in a sample of accreted and in-situ halo stars, focusing on short-period binaries. Utilising data from Gaia DR3, we analysed the radial velocity (RV) uncertainty $\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}}$ distribution of a sample of main-sequence stars. We used a novel Bayesian framework to model the dependence in $\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}}$ of single and binary systems allowing us to estimate binary fractions $F$ in a sample of bright ($G_{\mathrm{RVS}}$ &lt; 12) Gaia sources. We selected the samples of in-situ and accreted halo stars based on estimating the 6D phase space information and affiliating the stars to the different samples on an action-angle vs energy ($L_{\mathrm{z}}-E$) diagram. Our results indicate a higher, though not significant, binary fraction in accreted stars compared to the in-situ halo sample. We further explore binary fractions using cuts in $E$ and $L_z$ and find a higher binary fraction in both high-energy and prograde orbits that might be explained by differences in metallicity. By cross-matching our Gaia sample with APOGEE DR17 catalogue, we confirm the results of previous studies on higher binary fractions in metal-poor stars and find the fractions of accreted and in-situ halo stars consistent with this trend. Our finding provides new insights into binary stars' formation processes and dynamical evolution in the primordial Milky Way Galaxy and its accreted dwarf Galaxies.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational wave optical counterparts with the Zwicky Transient Facility: summary of O4a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the first half of the fourth observing run (O4a) of the International Gravitational Wave Network (IGWN), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) conducted a systematic search for kilonova (KN) counterparts to binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger candidates. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the five high-significance (FAR &lt; 1 per year) BNS and NSBH candidates in O4a. Our follow-up campaigns relied on both target-of-opportunity observations (ToO) and re-weighting of the nominal survey schedule to maximize coverage. We describe the toolkit we have been developing, Fritz, an instance of SkyPortal, instrumental in coordinating and managing our telescope scheduling, candidate vetting, and follow-up observations through a user-friendly interface. ZTF covered a total of 2841 deg$^2$ within the skymaps of the high-significance GW events, reaching a median depth of g~20.2 mag. We circulated 15 candidates, but found no viable KN counterpart to any of the GW events. Based on the ZTF non-detections of the high-significance events in O4a, we used a Bayesian approach, nimbus, to quantify the posterior probability of KN model parameters that are consistent with our non-detections. Our analysis favors KNe with initial absolute magnitude fainter than -16 mag. The joint posterior probability of a GW170817-like KN associated with all our O4a follow-ups was 64%. Additionally, we use a survey simulation software, simsurvey, to determine that our combined filtered efficiency to detect a GW170817-like KN is 36%, when considering the 5 confirmed astrophysical events in O3 (1 BNS and 4 NSBH), along with our O4a follow-ups. Following Kasliwal et al. (2020), we derived joint constraints on the underlying KN luminosity function based on our O3 and O4a follow-ups, determining that no more than 76% of KNe fading at 1 mag/day can peak at a magnitude brighter than -17.5 mag.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Fast Rotating Stars. I. Photometric calibration and results of AO-assisted BVRI+Halpha imaging of NGC330 with SAMI/SOAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: H$\alpha$ emission is a clear indicator of circumstellar activity in Be stars, historically employed to assess the classical Be star (CBe) population in young open clusters (YOCs). The YOC NGC330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud exhibits a large known fraction of {CBe} stars and was selected for a pilot study to establish a comprehensive methodology for identifying H$\alpha$ emitters in the Magellanic Clouds, encompassing the entire B-type spectral range. Using the SOAR Adaptative Module Imager (SAMI), we investigated the stellar population of NGC330 using multi-band BVRI+H$\alpha$ imaging. We identified H$\alpha$ emitters within the entire V-band range covered by SAMI/SOAR observations ($V\lesssim22$), comprising the complete B-type stellar population and offering a unique opportunity to explore the Be phenomenon across all spectral sub-classes. The stellar radial distribution shows a clear bimodal pattern between the most massive (B5 or earlier) and the lower-mass main-sequence objects (later than B6) within the cluster. The former is concentrated towards the cluster center (showing a dispersion of $\sigma=4.26\pm0.20$ pc), whereas the latter extends across larger radii ($\sigma=10.83\pm0.65$ pc), indicating mass stratification within NGC330. The total fraction of emitters is $4.4\pm0.5\%$, notably smaller than previous estimates from flux- or seeing-limited observations. However, a higher fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters is observed among higher-mass stars ($32.8\pm3.4\%$) than within lower-mass ($4.4\pm0.9\%$). Consequently, the putative CBe population exhibits distinct dynamical characteristics compared to the bulk of the stellar population in NGC330. These findings highlight the significance of the current observations in providing a complete picture of the CBe population in NGC330.</description>

      <title>WST - Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: Motivation, science drivers and top-level requirements for a new dedicated facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) project. WST is a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS), with both a low and high-resolution modes, and a giant 3x3 arcmin2 integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability, these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution, plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The telescope and instruments are designed as an integrated system and will mostly use existing technology, with the aim to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact. We will propose WST as the next European Southern Observatory (ESO) project after completion of the 39-metre ELT.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge with different stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the Galactic bulge features a multi-peak shape, with a metal-poor peak at [Fe/H]=-0.3 dex and a metal-rich peak at [Fe/H]=+0.3 dex. This bimodality is also seen in [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] ratios, indicating different stellar populations in the bulge. We aim to replicate the observed MDF by proposing a scenario where the metal-poor bulge stars formed in situ during an intense star formation burst, while the metal-rich stars formed during a second burst and/or were accreted from the inner Galactic disk due to a growing bar. We used a chemical evolution model that tracks various chemical species with detailed nucleosynthesis, focusing on Fe production from both Type Ia supernovae and massive stars, including rotating massive stars with varying velocities. Our model also accounts for gas infall, outflow, and the effect of stellar migration. Results are compared to 13,000 stars from the SDSS/APOGEE survey within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center. Our model successfully reproduces the double-peak shape of the bulge MDF and the alpha-element abundance trends relative to Fe by assuming (i) a multi-burst star formation history with a 250 Myr quenching of the first burst and (ii) stellar migration from the inner disk due to a growing bar. We estimate that about 40% of the bulge-bar's stellar mass originates from the inner disk. Nucleosynthesis models that assume either no rotation for massive stars or a rotational velocity distribution favoring slow rotation at high metallicities best match the observed MDF and [alpha/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance patterns.</description>

      <title>V892 Tau: A tidally perturbed circumbinary disc in a triple stellar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V892 Tau is a young binary star surrounded by a circumbinary disc which show hints of interaction with the low-mass nearby star V892 Tau NE. The goal of this paper is to constrain the orbit of V892 Tau NE and to determine the resulting circumbinary disc dynamics. We present new ALMA observations of the V892 Tau circumbinary disc at a twice higher angular and spectral resolution. We model the data with V892 Tau as a triple system and perform a grid of hydrodynamical simulations testing several orbits of the companion. The simulation outputs are then post-processed to build synthetic maps that we compare to the observations. The 12CO emission of the disc shows clear non-Keplerian features such as spiral arms. When comparing the data with our synthetic observations, we interpret these features as ongoing interactions with the companion. Our simulations indicate that an eccentricity of 0.5 of the companion is needed to reproduce the observed disc extent and that a mutual inclination of approximately 60{\deg} with the inner binary reproduces the measured disc tilt. In order to explain most of the features of the circumbinary disc, we propose that V892 Tau NE follows a misaligned eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity between 0.2 and 0.5 and a mutual inclination between 30{\deg} and 60{\deg}. Such a misaligned companion suggests the disc is oscillating and precessing with time, stabilising in an intermediate plane with a non-zero mutual inclination with the inner binary. Given that orbital configuration, we show that the stability of future planets is compromised in the second half of the disc once the gas has dissipated.</description>

      <title>One-winged butterflies: mode selection for azimuthal magnetorotational instability by thermal convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of thermal convection on turbulence in accretion discs, and particularly its interplay with the magnetorotational instability (MRI), are of significant astrophysical interest. Despite extensive theoretical and numerical studies, such an interplay has not been explored experimentally. We conduct linear analysis of the azimuthal version of MRI (AMRI) in the presence of thermal convection and compare the results with our experimental data published before. We show that the critical Hartmann number ($Ha$) for the onset of AMRI is reduced by convection. Importantly, convection breaks symmetry between $m = \pm 1$ instability modes ($m$ is the azimuthal wavenumber). This preference for one mode over the other makes the AMRI-wave appear as a ``one-winged butterfly''.</description>

      <title>Measuring White Dwarf Variability from Sparsely Sampled Gaia DR3 Multi-Epoch Photometry</title>

Abstract: White dwarf stars are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and are essential to understanding stellar evolution. While most white dwarfs are photometrically stable and reliable flux standards, some can be highly variable, which can reveal unique details about the endpoints of low-mass stellar evolution. In this study we characterize a sample of high-confidence white dwarfs with multi-epoch photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. We compare these Gaia light curves with light curves from the Zwicky Transiting Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to see when Gaia data independently can accurately measure periods of variability. From this sample, 105 objects have variability periods measured from the Gaia light curves independently, with periods as long as roughly 9.5 d and as short as 256.2 s (roughly 4 min), including seven systems with periods shorter than 1000 s. We discover 86 new objects from the 105 target sample, including pulsating, spotted, and binary white dwarfs, and even a new 68.4 min eclipsing cataclysmic variable. The median amplitude of the absolute photometric variability we confirm from Gaia independently is 1.4%, demonstrating that Gaia epoch photometry is capable of measuring short-term periods even when observations are sparse.</description>

      <title>The accretion burst of the massive young stellar object G323.46 -0.08</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion bursts from low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) are known for many decades. In recent years, the first accretion bursts of massive YSOs (MYSOs) have been observed. These phases of intense protostellar growth are of particular importance for studying massive star formation. Bursts of MYSOs are accompanied by flares of Class II methanol masers (hereafter masers), caused by an increase in exciting mid-infrared (MIR) emission. The G323.46$-$0.08 (hereafter G323) event extends the small sample of known MYSO bursts. Maser observations of the MYSO G323 show evidence of a flare, which was presumed to be caused by an accretion burst. This should be verified with IR data. We used time-dependent radiative transfer (TDRT) to characterize the heating and cooling timescales for eruptive MYSOs and to infer the main burst parameters. The G323 accretion burst is confirmed. It reached its peak in late 2013/early 2014 with a Ks-band increase of 2.5mag. TDRT indicates that the duration of the thermal afterglow in the far-infrared (FIR) can exceed the burst duration by years. The latter was proved by SOFIA observations, which indicate a flux increase of $(14.2\pm4.6)$% at $70\, \rm \mu m$ and $(8.5\pm6.1)$% at $160\, \mu$m in 2022 (2 years after the burst end). A one-sided light echo emerged that was propagating into the interstellar medium. The G323 burst is probably the most energetic MYSO burst observed so far. Within $8.4 \rm \, yrs$, an energy of $(0.9\pm_{0.8}^{2.5}) \times 10^{47}\,\rm erg$ was released. The short timescale points to the accretion of a compact body, while the burst energy corresponds to an accumulated mass of at least $(7\pm_{6}^{20})\,M_{Jup}$ and possibly even more if the protostar is bloated. In this case, the accretion event might have triggered protostellar pulsations, which give rise to the observed maser periodicity.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Stellar Mass and Binary Fraction of Open Clusters within 500 pc from the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the stellar mass function and the binary fraction of 114 nearby open clusters (OCs) using the high-precision photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3). We estimated the mass of member stars by using a ridge line (RL) that is better in line with the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD), thus obtaining more accurate stellar mass and binary mass ratio ($q$) at the low-mass region. By analyzing the present-day mass function (PDMF) of star clusters, we found that 108 OCs follow a two-stage power-law distribution, whereas 6 OCs present a single power-law PDMF. Subsequently, we fitted the high(low)-mass index of PDMF ($dN/dm \propto m^{-\alpha}$), denoted as $\alpha_{\rm h}$($\alpha_{\rm l}$), and segmentation point $m_{\rm c}$. For our cluster sample, the median values of $\alpha_{\rm h}$ and $\alpha_{\rm l}$ are 2.65 and 0.95, respectively, which are approximately consistent with the initial mass function (IMF) results provided by Kroupa (2001). We utilized the cumulative radial number distribution of stars with different masses to quantify the degree of mass segregation. We found a significant positive correlation between the state of dynamical evolution and mass segregation in OCs. We also estimated the fraction of binary stars with $q \geq 0.5$, ranging from 6% to 34% with a median of 17%. Finally, we provided a catalog of 114 nearby cluster properties, including the total mass, the binary fraction, the PDMF, and the dynamical state.</description>

      <title>SiO maser polarization and magnetic field in evolved cool stars</title>

Abstract: Both magnetic fields and photospheric/atmospheric dynamics can be involved in triggering the important mass loss observed in evolved cool stars. Previous works have revealed that these objects exhibit a magnetic field extending beyond their surface. The origin of this magnetic field is still under debate with mechanisms involving a turbulent dynamo, convection, stellar pulsation, and cool spots. Our goal is to estimate the magnetic field strength in the inner circumstellar envelope of six evolved cool stars (five Miras and one Red Supergiant). Combining this work with previous studies, we tentatively constrain the global magnetic field type observed and shed light on the mechanisms at its origin. Using the XPOL polarimeter installed at the IRAM-30 m telescope, we observed the 28 SiO v = 1, J = 2-1 maser line emission and obtained simultaneous spectroscopic measurements of the four Stokes parameters. Applying a careful calibration method for Stokes Q, U, and V, we derive estimates of the magnetic field strength from the circular and linear polarization fractions considering the saturated and unsaturated maser cases under the Zeeman hypothesis. Magnetic field strengths from several Gauss up to several tens of Gauss are derived. These new and more accurate measurements constraining the field strength in the 2-5 stellar radii region better than previous studies and seem to exclude a global poloidal magnetic field type. A combination of a toroidal and a poloidal field is nevertheless not excluded. A variation of the magnetic field strength over a two-months timescale is observed in one Mira star which suggests a possible link to the stellar phase, i.e. with pulsation/photospheric activity.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model for Ion and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of equations are developed that extend the macroscale magnetic reconnection simulation model kglobal to include particle ions. The extension from earlier versions of kglobal, which included only particle electrons, requires the inclusion of the inertia of particle ions in the fluid momentum equation, which was not required in the electron-only model. The new equations will facilitate the exploration of the simultaneous non-thermal energization of ions and electrons during magnetic reconnection in macroscale systems. Numerical tests of the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in a plasma with anisotropic electron and ion pressure are presented to benchmark the new model.</description>
