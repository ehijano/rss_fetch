      <title>Mathematical and computational perspectives on the Boolean and binary rank and their relation to the real rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the study of the binary and Boolean rank from both a mathematical and a computational perspective, with particular emphasis on their relationship to the real rank. We review the basic definitions of these rank functions and present the main alternative formulations of the binary and Boolean rank, together with their computational complexity and their deep connection to the field of communication complexity. We summarize key techniques used to establish lower and upper bounds on the binary and Boolean rank, including methods from linear algebra, combinatorics and graph theory, isolation sets, the probabilistic method, kernelization, communication protocols and the query to communication lifting technique. Furthermore, we highlight the main mathematical properties of these ranks in comparison with those of the real rank, and discuss several non-trivial bounds on the rank of specific families of matrices. Finally, we present algorithmic approaches for computing and approximating these rank functions, such as parameterized algorithms, approximation algorithms, property testing and approximate Boolean matrix factorization (BMF). Together, the results presented outline the current theoretical knowledge in this area and suggest directions for further research.</description>

      <title>Optional intervals event, sequential operation and their applications in physics, computer science and applied mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an algebraic framework for analyzing event execution intervals and sequences, introducing the concept of Optional Intervals Event(OIE) as a core abstraction. OIE maps real-world events into a 4-tuple structure that stores all feasible execution intervals and sub-event relationships. Based on this, two sequential operations are defined: Complete Sequential Addition models concurrent events with a certain degree of equal opportunity within a shared time domain, Complete Sequential Multiplication models sequential events with a strict order. And the algebraic properties and orbit spaces of these operations are analyzed.
  Addressing the traditional challenge of "simultaneous start", this paper argues that pointwise temporal equality of timestamps is an unattainable ideal due to physical limits of observational precision. Instead, using sequential operation, "simultaneous start" is reformulated as equal opportunity within an equipotential time window, rather than observed instantaneous equality. This paradigm shift moves the perspective from passive observation to active, constraint-aware planning, providing a more rigorous formal foundation for event scheduling, physical simulation, and computational modeling that can handle inherent observational uncertainties.</description>
