      <title>VIBES: A Multi-Scale Modeling Approach Integrating Within-Host and Between-Hosts Dynamics in Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious disease spread is a multi-scale process composed of within-host (biological) and between-host (social) drivers and disentangling them from each other is a central challenge in epidemiology. Here, we introduce VIBES, a multi-scale modeling framework that explicitly integrates viral dynamics based on patient-level data with population-level transmission on a data-driven network of social contacts. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we analyze three emergent epidemic properties, namely the generation time, serial interval, and pre-symptomatic transmission. First, we established a purely biological baseline, thus independent of the reproduction number (R), from the within-host model, estimating a generation time of 6.3 days for symptomatic individuals and 43.1% presymptomatic transmission. Then, using the full model incorporating social contacts, we found a shorter generation time (5.4 days at R=3.0) and an increase in pre-symptomatic transmission (52.8% at R=3.0), disentangling the impact of social drivers from a purely biological baseline. We further show that as pathogen transmissibility increases (R from 1.3 to 6), competition among infectious individuals shortens the generation time and serial interval by up to 21% and 13%, respectively. Conversely, a social intervention, like isolation, increases the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission by about 30%. Our framework also estimates metrics that are challenging to obtain empirically, such as the generation time for asymptomatic individuals (5.6 days; 95%CI: 5.1-6.0 at R=1.3). Our findings establish multi-scale modeling as a powerful tool for mechanistically quantifying how pathogen biology and human social behavior shape epidemic dynamics as well as for assessing public health interventions.</description>

      <title>How can we measure the information created by natural selection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural selection can create information. In particular, because of the action of natural selection, we can often learn something about an environment by examining local organisms, and vice versa. For example, the characteristics of a cactus suggest that the local environment is relatively dry, and if a natural terrestrial environment is dry, then we will generally have an enhanced probability of finding drought-resistant plants (like cacti). Here, we propose a measure that can be used to quantify the information that is created by natural selection. We call the proposed quantity reproductive information, and we show that it has an intuitively satisfying relationship to standard quantitative definitions of information. Reproductive information is also approximately equal to a previously defined measure of biological adaptation. In addition, we explain how reproductive information can be measured using phenotypic characters, instead of genotypes. This could facilitate the measurement of reproductive information, and it could also allow for the quantification of the information that is created by natural selection on groups of organisms, instead of just selection on individuals. Thus, the concept of reproductive information has the potential to advance research on the "units of selection", the "major transitions in evolution", and the emergence of "superorganisms" via cooperation among group members.</description>

      <title>A sharp lower bound for the number of phylogenetic trees displayed by a tree-child network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A normal (phylogenetic) network with $k$ reticulations displays $2^k$ phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we establish an analogous result for tree-child (phylogenetic) networks with no underlying $3$-cycles. In particular, we show that a tree-child network with $k\ge 2$ reticulations and no underlying $3$-cycles displays at least $2^{k/2}$ phylogenetic trees if $k$ is even and at least $\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}2^{k/2}$ if $k$ is odd. Moreover, we show that these bounds are sharp and characterise the tree-child networks that attain these bounds.</description>

      <title>The GFB Tree and Tree Imbalance Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree balance plays an important role in various research areas in phylogenetics and computer science. Typically, it is measured with the help of a balance index or imbalance index. There are more than 25 such indices available, recently surveyed in a book by Fischer et al. They are used to rank rooted binary trees on a scale from the most balanced to the least balanced. We show that a wide range of subtree-size based measures satisfying concavity and monotonicity conditions are minimized by the complete or greedy-from-the-bottom (GFB) tree and maximized by the caterpillar tree, yielding an infinitely large family of distinct new imbalance indices. Answering an open question from the literature, we show that one such established measure, the $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic, has the GFB tree as its unique minimizer. We also provide an alternative characterization of GFB trees, showing that they are equivalent to complete trees, which arise in different contexts. We give asymptotic bounds on the expected $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic under the uniform and Yule-Harding distributions of trees, and answer questions for the related $Q$-shape statistic as well.</description>
