      <title>From Cognitive Relief to Affective Engagement: An Empirical Comparison of AI Chatbots and Instructional Scaffolding in Physics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing effective, personalized support is critical for helping students overcome conceptual difficulties in physics. However, established scaffolding methods, such as structured tiered support, are often too resource-intensive for widespread implementation. Therefore, this study, investigates whether an easily adaptable, custom-configured AI chatbot can offer comparable affective benefits and cognitive relief. We conducted a quasi-experimental field study with 273 ninth-grade students in Germany. Classes were randomly assigned to solve a buoyancy problem using one of three conditions: an AI chatbot, a tiered support system, or traditional textbook-style explanations. We measured intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load and affective outcomes (enjoyment, hope, hopelessness, self-efficacy, situational interest) via research-validated questionnaires. Results revealed that both interactive support systems -- the custom-configured AI chatbot and tiered hints -- were significantly more effective than the textual support in reducing students' intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. Furthermore, the AI chatbot yielded the most comprehensive affective benefits, demonstrating significant improvements across all measured affective dimensions, when compared to the textual support. While the chatbot consistently trended more positively than the tiered hints on affective measures, these differences were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that while structured guidance is key to managing cognitive load, the interactive and social nature of AI chatbots holds unique potential for simultaneously fostering positive affective experiences, marking a promising direction for developing effective and holistic learning support tools in physics education.</description>
