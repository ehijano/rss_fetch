      <title>Cheeger's Constant for the Gabor Transform and Ripples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a new instability mechanism for short-time Fourier transform phase retrieval which yields that for any reasonable window function $\phi$ in any dimension $d$, the local stability constant $c(f)$ defined via
  \begin{equation*}
  \inf_{|\lambda|=1}\|f- \lambda g\|_{M^p(\mathbb{R}^{d})}\leq c(f)\| |V_\phi f|-|V_{\phi} g|\|_\mathcal{D}, \hspace{5mm} \forall g\in M^p(\mathbb{R}^d),
  \end{equation*}
  is infinite on a dense set of vectors for all weighted fractional Sobolev norms $\mathcal{D}$, up to the sharp maximal regularity level ensuring that the problem is well-defined. This, in particular, answers an open problem of Rathmair, who asked whether exponential concentration of the Gabor transform on $\mathbb{R}^2$ guaranteed a finite local stability constant. For the specific case of Gabor phase retrieval, we further show that there is a complementary dense set where the local stability constant on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ is finite.
  Our results extend and complement a series of fundamental stability theorems for Gabor phase retrieval which have been proven over the last ten years. Of particular note is the work of Grohs and Rathmair, who showed that for sufficiently strong weighted Sobolev norms $\mathcal{D}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, the local stability constant for Gabor phase retrieval is bounded by the inverse of the Cheeger constant of the flat metric conformally multiplied by $|V_\phi f|$. As a consequence of our analysis, we determine two dense families of functions, one of which has associated Cheeger constant zero and the other strictly positive. We also revisit the stability problem for STFT phase retrieval on bounded subsets of the time-frequency plane, for more general windows, and for restricted signal classes, extending and simplifying many influential results in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the optimal constant $C$ such that \begin{equation*} \|f_1*f_2*\dots*f_{k}\|_{\infty}\geq C\prod_{i=1}^{k}\|f_i\|_1 \end{equation*} for functions $f_i:\{0,1\}^d\to\mathbb{R}$. As applications, we derive bounds for Sidon sets on hypercubes, and, we also obtain bounds for the continuous analogue problem.</description>

      <title>The Ultra-Radical: Analytic Continuation, Branching, and Stability of the Principal Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ultra-radical $\sqrt[{n;a;b}]{x}$, the multi-valued solution to $y^{a}=1+a x y^{b}$. Inside the convergence radius $|x|&lt;R$, every branch is given by a Master-J power series; for $|x|\ge R$, analytic continuation requires switching to one of two conjugate series. We introduce a deterministic geometric criterion that selects, for each branch index $n$, the correct conjugate series, thereby eliminating heuristic search and guaranteeing branch continuity across $|x|=R$. Key finding: Only the principal branch ($n=0$) remains continuous when the parameters $a$, $b$, and $x$ vary smoothly. This includes the critical limits $a\to0$ (transition to an exponential equation) and $b\to0$ (transition to a binomial root), where the principal branch converges to the corresponding classical solution. In contrast, branches with $n\neq0$ exhibit oscillatory divergence as $a\to0$ and lose their identity in these limits. This structural continuity singles out the principal branch for applications where parameters may vary with the system's state, such as in nonlinear media with field-dependent exponents or adaptive dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On finding formal power-logarithmic expansions of solutions to $q$-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebraic $q$-difference equation is considered. A sufficient condition for the existence of a formal power-logarithmic expansion of a solution to such an equation in the neighborhood of zero is proposed. An example of applying this sufficient condition for constructing a formal expansion of a solution to a certain $q$-difference analogue of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation for specific values of the equation parameters is given; two different values of the number $q$ are considered, leading to qualitatively different formal asymptotic expansions of the solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the isomonodromy deformation equations for the $n\times n$ system of first order meromorphic linear ordinary differential equations with two second order poles. We analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions at a boundary point of the isomonodromic deformation space, and derive a parameterization of the solutions via asymptotic parameters. We then derive the explicit formula for the Stokes matrices and connection matrix of the associated linear system in terms of the asymptotic parameters. In the end, we apply the results to the study of the $tt^{*}$ equations.</description>

      <title>Kuznecov formulae for fractal measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact, connected Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\ge 2$, and let $\{e_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$ be an orthonormal basis of Laplace eigenfunctions $-\Delta_g e_j=\lambda_j^2 e_j$. Given a finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $M$, consider the Kuznecov sum \[
  N_\mu(\lambda):=\sum_{\lambda_j\le \lambda}\Bigl|\int_M e_j\,d\mu\Bigr|^2. \] Assume that $\mu$ is $s$-Ahlfors regular for some $s\in(0,n)$ and admits an averaged $s$-density constant $A_\mu$. We prove that \[
  N_\mu(\lambda)
  = (2\pi)^{-(n-s)}\,{\rm vol}\,(B^{\,n-s})\,A_\mu\,\lambda^{n-s}
  + o(\lambda^{n-s})
  \qquad (\lambda\to\infty). \] The hypotheses of $s$-Ahlfors regularity and the averaged $s$-density condition are essentially optimal for such a one-term asymptotic, and in general the remainder $o(\lambda^{n-s})$ cannot be improved uniformly to a power-saving error term. This extends the classical Kuznecov formulae of Zelditch for smooth submanifold measures to a broad class of singular and fractal measures.</description>

      <title>The basis functions of Fourier interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basis functions of the Fourier interpolation formula of Radchenko and Viazovska, constructed by means of weakly holomorphic modular forms for the Hecke theta group, are entire functions of order $2$ having interesting time-frequency properties. We give precise size estimates and study the distribution of zeros of these functions. We give in particular asymptotic estimates for the location and the number of extraneous zeros on or close to the real line. This result reveals the surprising existence of Fourier nonuniqueness pairs whose apparent ``excess'' compared to the Fourier uniqueness pair of Radchenko and Viazovska may be made arbitrarily large. Our estimates also show that the basis functions fail to yield a Riesz basis in the Hilbert space used by Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin in their recent study of Fourier uniqueness pairs. Some numerical data are presented, suggesting additional fine scale properties.</description>

      <title>Higher-Rank Mathieu Opers, Toda Chain, and Analytic Langlands Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated to flat sections of oper connections of arbitrary rank on the twice-punctured Riemann sphere with irregular singularities of the mildest type. We construct the solutions in terms of the solutions to a single non-linear integral equation. It follows from this construction that the generating function of the submanifold of opers coincides with the Yang-Yang function of the quantum Toda chain, proving a conjecture by Nekrasov, Rosly and Shatashvili. In this way we may furthermore reformulate the quantization conditions of the Toda chain in terms of the connection problem, for which we also provide a solution. We finally interpret our results as a variant of the Analytic Langlands Correspondence for the real version of the Hitchin system corresponding to the Toda chain.</description>

      <title>The monodromy of cyclic Pryms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The {\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\mathbb{P}}^1_{{\mathbb{F}}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in detail the class of even polynomials and their behavior with respect to finite free convolutions. To this end, we use some specific hypergeometric polynomials and a variation of the rectangular finite free convolution to understand even real-rooted polynomials in terms of positive-rooted polynomials. Then, we study some classes of even polynomials that are of interest in finite free probability, such as even hypergeometric polynomials, symmetrizations, and finite free commutators. Specifically, we provide many new examples of these objects, involving classical families of special polynomials (such as Laguerre, Hermite, and Jacobi). Finally, we relate the limiting root distributions of sequences of even polynomials with the corresponding symmetric measures that arise in free probability.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain local smoothing estimates for the averages over nondegenerate surfaces of codimension $2$ in $\mathbb R^4$. We make use of multilinear restriction estimates and decoupling inequalities for a hypersurface in $\mathbb R^5$, a conical extension of a two-dimensional nondegenerate surface along two flat directions. We also establish sharp $L^p$--$L^q$ estimates for maximal averages over nondegenerate surfaces of half the ambient dimension in $\mathbb R^{2n}$ for even $n \ge 2$.</description>

Abstract: A family of M-sets and null-series for the d-dimensional Walsh system is constructed if we consider convergence over rectangles, cubes, or iterated convergence. Non-empty portions of the constructed M-sets are also M-sets. The question of the rate of convergence to zero of the coefficients of zero-series that realize the constructed M-sets is studied, and it is shown how to modify the construction of the latter to turn them into U-sets</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the C\'ordoba-Fefferman square function estimate for the parabola to a weighted setting. Our weighted square function estimate is derived from a weighted wave envelope estimate for the parabola. The bounds are formulated in terms of families of multiscale tubes together with weight parameters that quantify the distribution of the weight. As an application, we obtain some weighted L^p-estimates for a class of Fourier multiplier operators and for solutions to free Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: We study asymptotic behavior of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with varying Verblunsky coefficients $\alpha_{n,N}$ when the ratio $n/N$ converges as $n,N\to\infty$.
  First, we give a streamlined proof of ratio asymptotics for orthogonal and paraorthogonal polynomials in the case of asymptotically constant and asymptotically periodic coefficients $\alpha_{n,N}$.
  Second, we determine the asymptotic zero distribution of paraorthogonal polynomials in the locally constant and locally periodic regimes. Analogous results are obtained for orthogonal polynomials under a mild additional condition on the varying coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We establish extrapolation of compactness for bilinear operators in the scale of weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. First, we prove an abstract principle relying on the Cobos-Fern\'{a}ndez-Cabrera-Mart\'{i}nez theorem. Then, as an application we deduce new compactness results for the commutators of bilinear $\omega$-Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators, bilinear fractional integrals and bilinear Fourier multipliers acting on weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. Our work extends and unifies among others earlier works of the second named author together with Hyt\"{o}nen as well as Oikari.</description>

      <title>Periodic Waves for the Regularized Camassa-Holm Equation: Existence and Spectral Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00433v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. To establish the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct solutions with the zero-mean property. We also prove that such waves may not exist for the well-known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional at the wave, restricted to the space of zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed from the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. Finally, we address the problem of orbital stability as a consequence of the spectral stability.</description>

      <title>Periodic solutions to nonlocal pseudo-differential equations. A bifurcation theoretical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use abstract bifurcation theory for Fredholm operators of index zero to deal with periodic even solutions of the one-dimensional equation $\mathcal{L}u=\lambda u+|u|^{p}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a nonlocal pseudodifferential operator defined as a Fourier multiplier and $\lambda$ is the bifurcation parameter. Our general setting includes the fractional Laplacian $\mathcal{L}\equiv(-\Delta)^{s}$ and sharpens the results obtained for this operator to date. As a direct application, we establish the existence of traveling waves for general nonlocal dispersive equations for some velocity ranges.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Second-Order and Curl-Free Field Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using techniques from harmonic analysis, we derive several sharp stability estimates for the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We also present the explicit lower and upper bounds for the sharp stability constants and compute their exact limits when the dimension $N\rightarrow\infty$. Our proofs rely on spherical harmonics decomposition and Fourier analysis, differing significantly from existing approaches in the literature. Our results substantially improve the stability constants of the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle recently obtained in [27]. As direct consequences of our main results, we also establish the sharp stability, with exact asymptotic behavior of the stability constants, of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with curl-free vector fields and a sharp version of the second order Poincar\'{e} type inequality with Gaussian measure.</description>

      <title>Mathematical exploration and discovery at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <title>On the entropy for indeterminate moment problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an indeterminate Hamburger moment problem we consider an infinite family of analytic densities solving the moment problem and we prove that they all have finite (Shannon) entropy. These densities are either all bounded or all unbounded. The result is illustrated by the Al-Salam--Carlitz moment problem, where all the densities in the family are bounded.</description>
