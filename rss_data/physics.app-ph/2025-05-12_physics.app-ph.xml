      <title>Temporal Effective Medium for Programmable Acoustic Metamaterials with Multiple Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend effective medium theory (EMT) to time-modulated, frequency-dispersive acoustic metamaterials with multiple resonances. While previous studies focused on non-dispersive or single-resonance systems, advances in programmable materials now enable precise control of time-varying responses. We derive explicit averaging rules that account for the interplay between resonant and modulation frequencies. When resonant frequencies are much lower than the modulation frequency, modulating the resonant strength yields the temporal average of monopolar susceptibility \c{hi}, while modulating the resonant frequency results in the average of 1/\c{hi}, applied per resonance mode. In hybrid cases, high-frequency resonances (relative to modulation) can be renormalized as a non-dispersive background before averaging the rest. This generalized temporal EMT offers a unified framework for designing compact, topologically robust, and non-Hermitian acoustic devices, leveraging the possible programmability of time-dependent material parameters in future.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Singlet Exciton Back-Transfer using 2D Spacer Layers for Perovskite-Sensitised Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon upconversion has potential applications in light-emitting diodes, photocatalysis, bio-imaging, microscopy, 3D printing, and photovoltaics. Bulk lead-halide perovskite films have emerged as promising sensitisers for solid-state photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. In this system, a perovskite sensitiser absorbs photons and subsequently generates triplet excitons in an adjacent emitter material, where triplet-triplet annihilation can occur allowing for the emission of higher energy photons. However, a major loss pathway in perovskite-sensitised upconversion is the back-transfer of singlet excitons from the emitter to the sensitiser via F\"orster Resonance Energy Transfer. In this investigation we introduce a 2D perovskite spacer layer between the bulk perovskite sensitiser and a rubrene emitter to mitigate back-transfer of singlet excitons from rubrene to the bulk perovskite sensitiser. This modification reveals the inherent balance between efficient triplet exciton transfer across the interface with a potential barrier versus the mitigation of near-field back-transfer by increasing the distance between the sensitiser and singlet excitons in the emitter. Notably, the introduction of this spacer layer enhances the relative upconversion efficiency at lower excitation power densities while also sustaining performance over extended timescales. This work represents significant progress toward the practical applications of perovskite-sensitised photon upconversion.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silica is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature, enabling their analysis at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La- APT). In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spin dynamics after dual optical excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort optical pulses are a cornerstone for manipulating electronic and magnetic states in materials on a femtosecond timescale. Conventional models assume that optical excitation primarily modifies the occupation of the electron energy levels without long-lasting altering of the coupling of individual electrons in certain processes. Here, we demonstrate that optical excitation with two femtosecond pulses that come from different directions fundamentally transforms the electron dynamics in copper, affecting the efficiency of angular momentum transfer between electrons and the lattice. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we reveal a ~2.5. increase in spin imbalance decay time following inverse Faraday effect excitation under dual-pump conditions compared to single-pulse excitation. This observation challenges the prevailing paradigm of ultrafast light-matter interactions, showing that dual optical excitation can transiently modify electron dynamics beyond simple changes in the energy levels occupancy. Our findings open new avenues for controlling quantum states through a dual pump approach, with implications for ultrafast spintronics and the design of novel light-driven states.</description>

      <title>Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Oxide Membranes from Bulk Micro-Machining of SrTiO$_3$ substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suspended micro-structures based on complex oxides relies on surface micro-machining processes such as those based on sacrificial layers. These processes prevent to physically access the microstructures from both sides, as substantial part of the substrate is not removed. In this work, we develop a bulk micromachining protocol of a commonly used substrate employed in oxide thin film deposition. We realize suspended oxide thin film devices by fabricating pass-through holes across SrTiO$_3$(100) or SrTiO$_3$(110) substrates. Careful calibration of anisotropic etching rates allows controlling the final geometry of the aperture in the substrate in a predictable way. As demonstrators of possible device geometries, we present clamped membranes and trampolines of (La,Sr)MnO$_3$, a conductive magnetic oxide, and a suspended trampoline resonator carved from the SrTiO$_3$ substrate itself. Reported protocols can be readily extended to a broad variety of other complex oxides so to extend the application of membranes technology beyond those of commercially-available silicon compounds.</description>

      <title>Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04159v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experiments, confirming that the synchronized temperature ramp-down can fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized temperature ramp-down can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we explore the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the temperature ramp-down can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution. The findings not only provide a robust method for stabilizing various superconducting magnet systems, including high-temperature superconducting magnets wound with second-generated (2G) coated tapes, but also suggest a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in other nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</description>
