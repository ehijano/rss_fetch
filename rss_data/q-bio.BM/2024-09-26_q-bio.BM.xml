      <title>X-ray multiple-beam (n-baem) dynamical diffraction theories, numerical methods to solve them and experimental verification by using the synchrotron X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior of X-rays diffracted in a perfect or quasi-perfect crystal can be described by the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. Study on the two-beam cases in which only transmitted and one reflected X-ray beams are strong has a history of one hundred years. However, the population of researchers who study on the multiple-beam cases (n-beam cases) in which more than two beams are simultaneously strong is small. The present author has derived the Takagi-Taupin (T-T) dynamical theory that can be applied to the n-beam cases, coded the computer programs to solve it and experimentally verified them by using the synchrotron X-rays. The equivalence between the Ewald-Laue (E-L) and the T-T dynamical theories described by the Fourier transform also for the n-beam cases is explicitly verified in the present paper. Further, the methods of the computer simulations and the experiments are also described.
  Furthermore, a hypothesis concerning the too large values of R-factor in protein crystallography is also described. This might be extremely important in protein crystallography in the future.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful technique for studying microscopic phenomena, but its computational cost has driven significant interest in the development of deep learning-based surrogate models. We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

      <title>AMARO: All Heavy-Atom Transferable Neural Network Potentials of Protein Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is crucial in various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and pharmacology to name a few. Conventional MD software struggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which restricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep generative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at learning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying both universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are designed solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the underlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and forces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional generative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns full-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained distribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force field, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process, giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting of peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen systems.</description>
