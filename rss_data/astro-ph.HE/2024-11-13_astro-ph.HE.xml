      <title>Type IIn Supernovae. I. Uniform Light Curve Characterization and a Bimodality in the Radiated Energy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest uniform study to date of Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn), focusing in this first paper on the multi-band optical light curves of $487$ SNe IIn. The sample, constructed from multiple surveys, extends to $z \approx 0.8$, with the majority of events at $z \lesssim 0.3$. We construct uniform multi-band and bolometric light curves using Gaussian process regression, and determine key observed properties in the rest-frame (e.g., peak luminosity, timescales, radiated energy). We find that SNe IIn span broad ranges in peak luminosity ($\sim 10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and timescales ($\sim 20-300$ days above 50% of peak luminosity), but the sample divides into two clear groups in the luminosity-timescale phase-space around the median peak luminosity ($\approx 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$): faint-fast and luminous-slow groups. This leads to a strong bimodality in the radiated energy distribution, with peaks at $\sim 10^{49}$ and $\sim 2\times10^{50}$ erg, with the latter events having a characteristic timescale of $\sim 100$ days, and the former appearing to bifurcate into two branches with timescales of $\sim 40$ and $\sim 70$ days. Therefore, SNe IIn exhibit at least two dominant groupings, and perhaps three, which are likely reflective of different progenitor and/or circumstellar medium formation pathways. We do not find any obvious transition in SN IIn properties at the arbitrary cut-off of $\approx -20$ mag used for the designation "Type II Superluminous Supernovae", and we argue that this classification should be abandoned. The absence of SNe IIn with timescales of $\lesssim 14$ days defines the region occupied by fast transients with evidence for interaction with hydrogen-poor circumstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Phase Space of Binary Black Holes from Gravitational Wave Observations to Unveil its Formation History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources offer a valuable window to the physical processes that govern the formation of binary compact objects (BCOs). However, deciphering such information from GW data is substantially challenging due to the difficulty in mapping from the space of observation to the space of numerous theoretical models. We introduce the concept of BCO Phase-Space that connects the observable space to the evolution trajectories of the BCO formation channels with cosmic time and apply it to the third GW transient catalog (GWTC-3) that brings new insights into probable astrophysical formation scenarios of nearly $90$ events. Our study reveals that two events, GW190425 and GW230529, show an overlap with a $\texttt{BCO Phase Space}$ trajectory of the same formation channel arising from a sub-solar mass black hole scenario that has grown into a higher mass by accretion, hinting towards the common primordial origin of both these sources. Though the actual formation channel is yet to be confirmed, with the availability of more GW events, the $\texttt{BCO Phase Space}$ can delve into distinguishing features of different formation channels for both astrophysical and primordial origin and opens the possibility of bringing new and deeper insights on the formation and evolution of BCOs across all observable masses over most of the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The long-term variability of a population of ULXs monitored by Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of a Chandra Large Program to monitor the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) populations of three nearby, ULX-rich galaxies over the course of a year, finding the ULX population to show a variety of long-term variability behaviours. Of a sample of 36 ULXs, some show persistent or moderately variable flux, often with a significant relationship between hardness and luminosity, consistent with a supercritically accreting source with varying accretion rates. Six show very high-amplitude variability with no strong relationship between luminosity and hardness, though not all of them show evidence of any long-term periodicity, nor of the bimodal distribution indicative of the propeller effect. We find evidence of additional eclipses for two previously-identified eclipsing ULXs. Additionally, many sources that were previously identified as ULXs in previous studies were not detected at ULX luminosities during our monitoring campaign, indicating a large number of transient ULXs.</description>

      <title>Nuclear burning in an accretion flow around a stellar-mass black hole embedded within an AGN disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stellar-mass black hole, embedded within the accretion disk of an active galactic nuclei (AGN), has the potential to accrete gas at a rate that can reach approximately $\sim 10^9$ times the Eddington limit. This study explores the potential for nuclear burning in the rapidly accreting flow towards this black hole and studies how nucleosynthesis affects metal production. Using numerical methods, we have obtained the disk structure while considering nuclear burning and assessed the stability of the disk. In contrast to gas accretion onto the surface of a neutron star or white dwarf, the disk remains stable against the thermal and secular instabilities because advection cooling offsets the nuclear heating effects. The absence of a solid surface for a black hole prevents excessive mass accumulation in the inner disk region. Notably, nuclear fusion predominantly takes place in the inner disk region, resulting in substantial burning of $\rm ^{12}C$ and $\rm ^{3}He$, particularly for black holes around $M = 10\, M_\odot$ with accretion rates exceeding approximately $\sim 10^7$ times the Eddington rate. The ejection of carbon-depleted gas through outflows can lead to an increase in the mass ratio of oxygen or nitrogen to carbon, which may be reflected in observed line ratios such as $\rm N\, V/C\, IV$ and $\rm O\, IV/C\, IV$. Consequently, these elevated spectral line ratios could be interpreted as indications of super-solar metallicity in the broad line region.</description>

      <title>Radio Follow-up Observations of SN 2023ixf by Japanese and Korean VLBIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on radio follow-up observations of the nearby Type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, spanning from 1.7 to 269.9 days after the explosion, conducted using three very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs), which are the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN), the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), and the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). In three observation epochs (152.3, 206.1, and 269.9 days), we detected emission at the 6.9 and 8.4 GHz bands, with a flux density of $\sim 5$ mJy. The flux density reached a peak at around 206.1 days, which is longer than the timescale to reach the peak observed in typical Type II supernovae. Based on the analytical model of radio emission, our late-time detections were inferred to be due to the decreasing optical depth. In this case, the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is estimated to have increased from $\sim 10^{-6} - 10^{-5}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ to $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ between 28 and 6 years before the explosion. Our radio constraints are also consistent with the mass-loss rate to produce a confined circumstellar medium proposed by previous studies, which suggest that the mass-loss rate increased from $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ to $\gtrsim 10^{-2}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ in the last few years before the explosion.</description>

      <title>Are there Black Hole Symbiotic X-ray Binaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there are over a dozen known neutron star (NS) symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) in the Galaxy, none SyXBs containing a black hole (BH) have been detected. We address this problem by incorporating binary population synthesis and the accretion properties of BHs fed by the wind from red giant companions. We investigate the impact of different supernova mechanisms, kick velocity distributions and wind velocities on the formation of both NS and BH SyXBs. Our simulations show that the number of BH SyXBs is at most one-sixth that of NS SyXBs in the Galaxy provided that the common envelope efficiency parameter $\alpha\sim 0.3-5$. And less than $\sim 10$ of BH SyXBs could be detectable in X-ray, considering their low radiation efficiencies. These findings indicate a scarcity of BH SyXBs in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A nearby FR I type radio galaxy 3C 120 as a neutrino emitting candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although connections between flaring blazars and some IceCube neutrinos have been established, the dominant sources for the bulk extragalactic neutrino emissions are still unclear and one widely suggested candidate is a population of radio galaxies. Because of their relatively low $\gamma$-ray radiation luminosities ($L_\gamma$), it is rather challenging to confirm such a hypothesis with the neutrino/GeV flare association. Here we report on the search for GeV $\gamma$-ray counterpart of the neutrino IC-180213A and show that the nearby ($z$ = 0.03) broad line radio galaxy 3C 120 is the unique co-spatial GeV $\gamma$-ray source in a half-year epoch around the neutrino detection. Particularly, an intense $\gamma$-ray flare, the second strongest one among the entire 16-year period, is temporally coincident with the detection of IC-180213A. Accompanying optical flare is observed, too. We also find that the IC-180213A/3C 120 association well follows the $L_\gamma$-$D_{L}^{2}$ correlation for the (candidate) neutrino sources including NGC 1068 and some blazars. These facts are strongly in favor of 3C 120 as a high energy neutrino emitter and provide the first piece of evidence for the radio galaxy origin of some PeV neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Image of the Kerr-Newman black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The image of a Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole (BH) surrounded by a thin accretion disk is derived. By employing elliptic integrals and ray-tracing methods, we analyze photon trajectories around the KN BH. At low observation inclination angles, the secondary image of particles is embedded within the primary image. However, as the inclination increases, the primary and secondary images separate, forming a hat-like structure. The spin and charge of the BH, along with the observer's inclination angle, affect the image's asymmetry and the distortion of the inner shadow. To investigate the redshift distribution on the accretion disk, we extended the inner boundary of the accretion disk to the event horizon. The results show that the redshift distribution is significantly influenced by the observation inclination angle. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of the KN BH image using fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques and found that the optical appearance and intensity distribution of the BH vary at different observation frequencies (specifically at 230GHz and 86GHz). We also examined differences in intensity distribution for prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. Comparing observational at the two frequencies, we found that both the total intensity and peak intensity at 86GHz are higher than those at 230GHz.</description>

      <title>Revisiting X-ray Afterglows of Jetted Tidal Disruption Events with the External Reverse Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the external reverse shock region of relativistic jets as the origin of X-ray afterglows of jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) that exhibit luminous jets accompanied by fast-declining non-thermal X-ray emissions. We model the dynamics of jet propagating within an external density medium, accounting for continuous energy injection driven by accretion activities. We compute the time-dependent synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions from the reverse shock region. Our analysis demonstrates that the reverse shock scenario can potentially explain the X-ray light curves and spectra of four jetted TDEs, AT 2022cmc, Swift J1644, Swift J2058, and Swift J1112. Notably, the rapid steepening of the late-stage X-ray light curves can be attributed jointly to the jet break and cessation of the central engine as the accretion rate drops below the Eddington limit. Using parameters obtained from X-ray data fitting, we also discuss the prospects for $\gamma$-ray and neutrino detection.</description>

      <title>Et tu, Brute?: The Crab Nebula also exploded by jittering jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a point-symmetrical morphology comprised of seven pairs of opposite bays in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant Crab Nebula, which is consistent with the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. We use a recently published infrared image of the Crab Nebula and apply image analysis to fit seven pairs of bays in the Crab, each pair of two bays and a symmetry axis connecting them. The seven symmetry axes intersect close to the explosion site, forming a point-symmetrical structure. We explain the bays as clumps that move slower than the low-density ejecta that the pulsar accelerated. Jittering jets that exploded the Crab formed the clumps during the explosion process. This shows that jittering jets explode even very low-energy CCSNe, as the Crab is, adding to the solidification of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of electron magnetohydrodynamics with Landau-quantized electrons in magnetar crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetar crusts, magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to confine electrons into a small to moderate number of quantized Landau levels. This can have a dramatic effect on the crust's thermodynamic properties, generating field-dependent de Haas-van Alphen oscillations. We previously argued that the large amplitude oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility could enhance the Ohmic dissipation of the magnetic field by continuously generating small-scale, rapidly dissipating field features. This could be important to magnetar field evolution and contribute to their observed higher temperatures. To study this, we performed quasi-3D numerical simulations of electron MHD in a representative volume of neutron star crust matter, for the first time including the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility resulting from Landau quantization. We find that the potential enhancement in the Ohmic dissipation rate due to this effect can be a factor $\sim 3$ for temperatures of order $10^8$ K and $\sim 4.5$ for temperatures of order $5\times 10^7$ K, depending on the magnetic field configuration. The nonlinear Hall term is crucial to this amplification: without it the magnetic field decay is only enhanced by a factor $\lesssim 2$ even at $5\times 10^7$ K. These effects generate a high wave number plateau in the magnetic energy spectrum associated with the small-scale de Haas--van Alphen oscillations. Our results suggest that this mechanism could help explain the magnetar heating problem, though due to the effect's temperature-dependence, full magneto-thermal evolution simulations in a realistic stellar model are needed to judge whether it is viable explanation.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Optical Afterglows Without Gamma-ray Bursts: Identification of AT2023lcr and Multiwavelength Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few years, the improved sensitivity and cadence of wide-field optical surveys have enabled the discovery of several afterglows without associated detected gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We present the identification, observations, and multiwavelength modeling of a recent such afterglow (AT2023lcr), and model three literature events (AT2020blt, AT2021any, and AT2021lfa) in a consistent fashion. For each event, we consider the following possibilities as to why a GRB was not observed: 1) the jet was off-axis; 2) the jet had a low initial Lorentz factor; and 3) the afterglow was the result of an on-axis classical GRB (on-axis jet with physical parameters typical of the GRB population), but the emission was undetected by gamma-ray satellites. We estimate all physical parameters using afterglowpy and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods from emcee. We find that AT2023lcr, AT2020blt, and AT2021any are consistent with on-axis classical GRBs, and AT2021lfa is consistent with both on-axis low Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \approx 5 - 13$) and off-axis ($\theta_\text{obs}=2\theta_\text{jet}$) high Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \approx 100$) jets.</description>

      <title>Observing the Meissner effect in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of a new mechanism for the rapid onset of the Meissner effect in a young neutron star, via an interplay of field-line advection by fluid motion and magnetic reconnection. This mechanism provides the first justification for an assumption at the centre of magnetar simulations. Reconnection leads to a characteristic release of energy, which can be used to constrain superconducting gap models. Our model provides a natural explanation for the recently discovered long-period radio sources, and also has important implications for neutron-star rotational evolution and gravitational-wave emission. The Meissner effect is only operative for field strengths $10^{12}\,\mathrm{G}\lesssim B\lesssim 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$.</description>

      <title>The Meissner effect in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first model aimed at understanding how the Meissner effect in a young neutron star affects its macroscopic magnetic field. In this model, field expulsion occurs on a dynamical timescale, and is realised through two processes that occur at the onset of superconductivity: fluid motions causing the dragging of field lines, followed by magnetic reconnection. Focussing on magnetic fields weaker than the superconducting critical field, we show that complete Meissner expulsion is but one of four possible generic scenarios for the magnetic-field geometry, and can never expel magnetic flux from the centre of the star. Reconnection causes the release of up to $\sim 5\times 10^{46}\,\mathrm{erg}$ of energy at the onset of superconductivity, and is only possible for certain favourable early-phase dynamics and for pre-condensation fields $10^{12}\,\mathrm{G}\lesssim B\lesssim 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$. Fields weaker or stronger than this are predicted to thread the whole star.</description>

      <title>Full 3D nonlinear dynamics of charged and magnetized boson stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauged boson stars are exotic compact objects that can potentially mimic black holes or magnetized neutron stars in both their gravitational and electromagnetic signatures, offering a compelling new description or even an alternative explanation for various multimessenger phenomena. As a crucial step toward establishing boson stars as viable multimessenger sources, we perform 3D numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system, focusing on both spherical and axisymmetric boson star configurations that vary in their electromagnetic coupling between the neutral case up to values close to the critical case, and so their magnetic field content. For spherical configurations, we consistently find stable solutions. In contrast, for axially symmetric, electrically neutral, magnetized configurations, the dynamics are highly sensitive to the electromagnetic coupling. Configurations with stronger coupling develop a one-armed mode instability, which leads to collapse into black holes. Configurations with weaker coupling undergo a two-stage process: an initial bar-mode instability that triggers a one-armed spiral deformation. This eventually also results in black hole formation, accompanied by emissions of both gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. A similar instability and two-stage pattern is observed in all charged rotating boson stars analyzed. However, all of these configurations become stable when self-interactions are introduced.</description>

      <title>Imprints of black hole charge on the precessing jet nozzle of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed jet precession period of approximately 11 years for M87* strongly suggests the presence of a supermassive rotating black hole with a tilted accretion disk at the center of the galaxy. By modeling the motion of the tilted accretion disk particle with the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, we study the effect of charge on the observation of the precession period, thereby exploring the potential of this strong-gravity observation in constraining multiple black hole parameters. Firstly, we study the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole and find that their precession periods increase with the charge. Secondly, we utilize the observed M87* jet precession period to constrain the relationship between the spin, charge, and warp radius, specifically detailing the correlations between each pair of these three quantities. Moreover, to further refine constraints on the charge, we explore the negative correlation between the maximum warp radius and charge. A significant result shows that the gap between the maximum warp radii of the prograde and retrograde orbits decrease with the black hole charge. If the warp radius is provided by other observations, different constraints on the charge can be derived for the prograde and retrograde cases. These results suggest that in the era of multi-messenger astronomy, such strong-gravity observation of precessing jet nozzle presents a promising avenue for constraining black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass models on a 3D mesh: IV. Improved description of the isospin dependence of pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08007v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing reliable data on the properties of atomic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter to astrophysical applications remains extremely challenging, especially when treating both properties coherently within the same framework. Methods based on energy density functionals (EDFs) enable manageable calculations of nuclear structure throughout the entire nuclear chart and of the properties of infinite nuclear matter across a wide range of densities and asymmetries. To address these challenges, we present BSkG4, the latest Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid model. It is based on an EDF of the extended Skyrme type with terms that are both momentum and density-dependent, and refines the treatment of $^1S_0$ nucleon pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter as inspired by more advanced many-body calculations. The newest model maintains the accuracy of earlier BSkGs for known atomic masses, radii and fission barriers with rms deviations of 0.633 MeV w.r.t. 2457 atomic masses, 0.0246 fm w.r.t. 810 charge radii, and 0.36 MeV w.r.t 45 primary fission barriers of actinides. It also improves some specific pairing-related properties, such as the $^1S_0$ pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter, neutron separation energies, $Q_\beta$ values, and moments of inertia of finite nuclei. This improvement is particularly relevant for describing the $r$-process nucleosynthesis as well as various astrophysical phenomena related to the rotational evolution of neutron stars, their oscillations, and their cooling.</description>

      <title>How neutron star properties disfavor a nuclear chiral density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold and dense matter may break rotational symmetry spontaneously and thus form an anisotropic phase in the interior of neutron stars. We consider the concrete example of an anisotropic chiral condensate in the form of a chiral density wave. Employing a nucleon-meson model and taking into account fermionic vacuum fluctuations, we improve and extend previous results by imposing the conditions of electric charge neutrality and electroweak equilibrium, by allowing for a more general form of the vector meson self-interactions, and by including properties of pure neutron matter into the fit of the model parameters. We find that the conditions inside neutron stars postpone the onset of the chiral density wave to larger densities compared to isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. While this still allows for the construction of stars with an anisotropic core, we find that the chiral density wave is energetically preferred only in a corner of the parameter space where matter is too soft to generate stars with realistic masses. Therefore, taking into account constraints from astrophysical data, our calculation predicts an isotropic neutron star core.</description>

      <title>The Peak Frequency and Luminosity of Synchrotron Emitting Shocks: from Non-Relativistic to Ultra-Relativistic Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchrotron emission is ubiquitous in explosive astrophysical events -- it is a natural byproduct of shocks formed when matter expelled by the explosion collides with ambient material. This emission is well-observed in various classes of transients, and is often interpreted within a canonical `equipartition' framework that allows physical properties of the shock to be inferred from the frequency and luminosity at which the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks. This framework has been remarkably successful in explaining observations of radio supernovae. It has also been used for trans-relativistic explosions, where the shock velocities approach the speed of light. However, the conventional framework does not incorporate relativistic effects. Neither does it account for thermal electrons, which have been shown to be important for high-velocity shocks. In this paper we describe a revised framework that accounts for these two effects, and is applicable to non-relativistic, trans-relativistic, and ultra-relativistic explosions. We show that accounting for these effects can dramatically change the inferred parameters of high-velocity shocks, and in particular -- that the shock velocity, ambient density, and total energy are overestimated by the conventional non-relativistic framework. We delineate the phase-space where such modifications are important in terms of observationally measurable parameters. We also find a novel upper limit on the peak synchrotron luminosity of shock-powered transients, which is remarkably consistent with existing observations. Finally, we discuss a prediction of the model -- that the SED will qualitatively change as a function of shock velocity -- and show that this is broadly consistent with data for representative events (e.g., SN1998bw, AT2018cow, CSS161010, AT2020xnd).</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Origin of Black Hole Spin in Lower-Mass-Gap Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration reported the detection of a coalescing compact binary (GW230529$_{-}$181500) with component masses estimated at $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ with 90\% credibility. Given the current constraints on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, this event is most likely a lower-mass-gap (LMG) black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary. The spin magnitude of the BH, especially when aligned with the orbital angular momentum, is critical in determining whether the NS is tidally disrupted. An LMG BHNS merger with a rapidly spinning BH is an ideal candidate for producing electromagnetic counterparts. However, no such signals have been detected. In this study, we employ a detailed binary evolution model, incorporating new dynamical tide implementations, to explore the origin of BH spin in an LMG BHNS binary. If the NS forms first, the BH progenitor (He-rich star) must begin in orbit shorter than 0.35 days to spin up efficiently, potentially achieving a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} &gt; 0.3$. Alternatively, if a non-spinning BH (e.g., $M_{\rm BH} = 3.6\, M_\odot$) forms first, it can accrete up to $\sim 0.2\, M_\odot$ via Case BA mass transfer (MT), reaching a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim 0.18$ under Eddington-limited accretion. With a higher Eddington accretion limit (i.e., 10.0 $\Dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH can attain a significantly higher spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim\,0.65$ by accreting approximately $1.0\, M_\odot$ during Case BA MT phase.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of OT 081: broadband modelling of a transitional blazar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OT 081 is a well-known, luminous blazar that is remarkably variable in many energy bands. We present the first broadband study of the source which includes very-high-energy (VHE, $E&gt;$100\,GeV) $\gamma$-ray data taken by the MAGIC and H.E.S.S. imaging Cherenkov telescopes. The discovery of VHE $\gamma$-ray emission happened during a high state of $\gamma$-ray activity in July 2016, observed by many instruments from radio to VHE $\gamma$-rays. We identify four states of activity of the source, one of which includes VHE $\gamma$-ray emission. Variability in the VHE domain is found on daily timescales. The intrinsic VHE spectrum can be described by a power-law with index $3.27\pm0.44_{\rm stat}\pm0.15_{\rm sys}$ (MAGIC) and $3.39\pm0.58_{\rm stat}\pm0.64_{\rm sys}$ (H.E.S.S.) in the energy range of 55--300\,GeV and 120--500\,GeV, respectively. The broadband emission cannot be sucessfully reproduced by a simple one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. Instead, an additional external Compton component is required. We test a lepto-hadronic model that reproduces the dataset well and a proton-synchrotron dominated model that requires an extreme proton luminosity. Emission models that are able to successfully represent the data place the emitting region well outside of the Broad Line Region (BLR) to a location at which the radiative environment is dominated by the infrared thermal radiation field of the dusty torus. In the scenario described by this flaring activity, the source appears to be an FSRQ, in contrast with past categorizations. This suggests that the source can be considered to be a transitional blazar, intermediate between BL~Lac and FSRQ objects.</description>

      <title>Breaking boundaries: extending the orbit averaged Fokker-Planck equation inside the loss cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a new formulation of loss cone theory as a reaction-diffusion system, which is orbit averaged and accounts for loss cone events through a sink term. This formulation can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. The relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space has a simple analytic form, and it predicts accurately the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption, better than other available formulas. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions - that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation. This allows to explore in a simple way dynamical effects that might affect tidal disruption events rates, tackling the expected vs observed rate tension and the over-representation of E+A galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a promising method for studying sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are a challenging detection target. While extensive searches have been made in the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands, systematic infrared (IR) studies remain limited. Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which provides unique decade-long mid-IR light curves with a six-month cadence, we have conducted the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates based on IR periodicity. Analyzing a parent sample of 48,932 objects selected from about half a million AGNs, we have identified 28 candidate periodic AGNs with periods ranging from 1,268 to 2,437 days (in the observer frame) by fitting their WISE light curves with sinusoidal functions. However, our mock simulation of the parent sample indicates that stochastic variability can actually produce a similar number of periodic sources, underscoring the difficulty in robustly identifying real periodic signals with WISE light curves, given their current sampling. Notably, we found no overlap between our sample and optical periodic sources, which can be explained by a distinct preference for certain periods due to selection bias. By combining archived data from different surveys, we have identified SDSS J140336.43+174136.1 as a candidate exhibiting periodic behavior in both optical and IR bands, a phenomenon that warrants further validation through observational tests. Our results highlight the potential of IR time-domain surveys, including future missions such as the Nancy Grace-Roman Space Telescope, for identifying periodic AGNs, but complementary tests are still needed to determine their physical origins such as SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Universe with Next Generation Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we use simple performance metrics to assess the science capabilities of future ground-based gravitational-wave detector networks -- composed of A+ or Voyager upgrades to the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories and proposed next generation observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. These metrics refer to coalescences of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and binary black holes (BBHs) and include: (i) network detection efficiency and detection rate of cosmological sources as a function of redshift, (ii) signal-to-noise ratios and the accuracy with which intrinsic and extrinsic parameters would be measured, and (iii) enabling multimessenger astronomy with gravitational waves by accurate 3D localization and early warning alerts. We further discuss the science enabled by the small population of rare and extremely loud events. While imminent upgrades will provide impressive advances in all these metrics, next generation observatories will deliver an improvement of an order-of-magnitude or more in most metrics. In fact, a network containing two or three such facilities will detect half of all the BNS and BBH mergers up to a redshift of $z=1$ and $z=20$, respectively, give access to hundreds of BNSs and ten thousand BBHs with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 100, readily localize hundreds to thousands of mergers to within $1\,{\rm deg^2}$ on the sky and better than 10% in luminosity distance, respectively, and consequently, enable mutlimessenger astronomy through follow-up surveys in the electromagnetic spectrum several times a week. Such networks will further shed light on potential cosmological merger populations and detect an abundance of high-fidelity BNS and BBH signals which will allow investigations of the high-density regime of matter at an unprecedented level and enable precision tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime, respectively.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of weakly collisional plasma: continuous spectra, discrete eigenmodes, and the decay of echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of a weakly collisional plasma, which is of fundamental interest to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, can be described by the Boltzmann-Poisson equations with the Lenard-Bernstein collision operator. We perform a perturbative analysis of these equations, and obtain exact analytic solutions that resolve long-standing controversies regarding the impact of weak collisions on the continuous spectra, discrete Landau eigenmodes, and the decay of plasma echoes. We retain both damping and diffusion terms in the collision operator. We find that the linear response is a temporal convolution of a continuum that depends on the continuous velocities of particles (crucial for the plasma echo) and discrete modes that describe coherent oscillations of the entire system. The discrete modes are exponentially damped over time due to collective effects or wave-particle interactions (Landau damping) as well as collisional dissipation. The continuum is also damped by collisions, but somewhat differently. Up to a collision time, the inverse of the collision frequency $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$, the continuum decay is driven by the diffusion of particle velocities and occurs cubic exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu^{-1/3}_{\mathrm{c}}$. After a collision time, however, the continuum decay is driven by the damping of velocities and diffusion of positions, and occurs exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu_{\mathrm{c}}$. This slow exponential decay damps perturbations the most on scales $\lambda$ comparable to the mean free path $\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$, but very slowly on larger scales. This establishes local thermal equilibrium, the essence of the fluid limit, and enhances the detectability of the plasma echo. The long-term decay is driven by the discrete modes for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$, but, by the slowly decaying continuum and the least damped mode for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the conformal limit inside rotating neutron stars: Implications to modified theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the supranuclear densities achieved inside a neutron star, matter may exhibit extreme properties. In particular, it may be the case that a suitable average of the speed of sound squared exceeds the so-called conformal limit, i.e., $\langle c_s^2 \rangle &gt; 1/3$, a condition that is equivalent to the positiveness of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor at the stellar center. This property, that holds for highly compact neutron stars obeying many (but not any) realistic equations of state, would turn these objects into interesting laboratories for tests of several scalar extensions of general relativity. In this paper, we investigate how rapid rotation influences the superconformality of the averaged speed of sound squared and modified gravity effects that depend thereupon, paying particular attention to scalar-tensor theories prone to the spontaneous scalarization effect.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point and hysteresis in perturbations of Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. We find that the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone coincide for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We also show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>
