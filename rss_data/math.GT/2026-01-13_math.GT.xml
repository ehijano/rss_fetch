      <title>Rational surgery exact triangles in Heegaard Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new family of surgery exact triangles in Heegaard Floer theory over the field with two elements. This family generalizes both Ozsv\'{a}th and Szab\'{o}'s $n$- and $1/n$-surgery exact triangles for positive integers $n$ and the author's recent 2-surgery exact triangle to all positive rational slopes.
  The construction reduces to a combinatorial problem that involves triangle and quadrilateral counting maps in a genus 1 Heegaard diagram. The main contribution of this paper is solving this combinatorial problem, which is particularly tricky for slopes $r\neq n,1/n$; one key idea is to use an involution that is closely related to the ${\rm Spin}^{c}$ conjugation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of $G$-ANR spaces and inverse limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that, for a compact group $G$, a metrizable $G$-space is a $G$-ANR under the following asumptions: (1) if it dominates a $G$-ANR space through a fine $G$-homotopy equivalence; (2) if it is $G$-homotopy dense in a $G$-ANR; (3) if it contains a $G$-ANR as a $G$-homotopy dense subset; (4) if it is the inverse limit of an inverse sequence of $G$-ANR spaces with bonding maps that are fine $G$-homotopy equivalences.</description>

      <title>The topological and smooth Hausmann-Weinberger invariants disagree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\pi$ a finitely presented group, Hausmann and Weinberger defined $q(\pi) \in \mathbb Z$ to be the minimum Euler characteristic over all closed, oriented $4$-manifolds with fundamental group $\pi$. This short note establishes that this minimum value in general differs depending on whether one minimizes over topological manifolds or only those admitting a smooth structure.</description>

      <title>Configured locally smooth cohomology and $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-torsion in $H_3$ of diffeomorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce configured group cohomology, a variant of locally smooth cohomology built from well-configured tuples and geometric fillings. This framework yields explicit locally smooth $\R/\Z$-valued $3$-cocycles of Chern--Simons type on diffeomorphism groups preserving geometric structures. As an application we show that, for several such groups, the third group homology contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\Q/\Z$.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Coxeter polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is an introduction to Coxeter polyhedra in spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic geometries. It consists of essentially two parts that could be read independently. In the first we introduce non-obtuse polyhedra in the spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic spaces, and prove various fundamental theorems originated from Andreev, Coxeter, and Vinberg. In the second we introduce Coxeter polyhedra and use them to describe regular, semiregular, and uniform polyhedra and tessellations, mostly via the Wythoff construction.</description>

      <title>Topology of domains of discontinuity for Anosov representations via circle actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the remarkable properties shared with convex cocompact representations, Anosov representations admit cocompact domains of discontinuity in flag varieties. For representations produced by embedding Fuchsian representations into higher rank Lie groups, these domains are known to admit fiber bundle structures and the structure group is $\operatorname{SO}(2)$. In this article, we determine the equivariant diffeomorphism type of the fiber for these bundles when the domain lives inside a $3$-dimensional complex flag variety. In order to do so, we explicitly work out a smooth version of Fintushel's classification theorem for smooth $S^1$-actions on $4$-manifolds. We show that, in each case, the action on the fiber is equivalent to a circle action on a Hirzebruch surface (or an equivariant connected sum of such actions).</description>

      <title>Homotopy type of spaces of locally convex curves in the sphere S^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally convex (or nondegenerate) curves in the sphere $S^n$ have been studied for several reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations of order $n+1$. Taking Frenet frames allows us to obtain corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group $Spin_{n+1}$. Let $L_n(z_0;z_1)$ be the space of such curves $\Gamma$ with prescribed endpoints $\Gamma(0) = z_0$, $\Gamma(1) = z_1$. The aim of this paper is to determine the homotopy type of the spaces $L_3(z_0;z_1)$ for all $z_0, z_1 \in Spin_4$. As a corollary, we obtain the homotopy type of the space of closed locally convex curves in either $S^3$ or $P^3$.
  There are many previous papers addressing related questions. An early paper solves the corresponding problem for curves in $S^2$. Another previous result (with B. Shapiro) reduces the problem to $z_0 = 1$ and $z_1 \in Quat_4$ where $Quat_4 \subset Spin_4$ is a finite group of order $16$. A more recent paper shows that for $z_1 \in Quat_4 \smallsetminus Z(Quat_4)$ we have a homotopy equivalence $L_3(1;z_1) \approx \Omega Spin_4$. In this paper we compute the homotopy type of $L_3(1;z_1)$ for $z_1 \in Z(Quat_4)$: it is equivalent to the wedge of $\Omega Spin_4$ with an infinite countable family of spheres (as for the case $n = 2$).
  The structure of the proof can be compared to that of the case $n = 2$ but some of the steps require the creation of new theories, involving algebra and combinatorics. We construct explicit subsets $Y \subset L_n(z_0;z_1)$ for which the inclusion $Y \subset \Omega Spin_{n+1}(z_0;z_1)$ is a homotopy equivalence. For $n = 2$, there is a simple geometric description of $Y$; for $n = 3$, the far less natural construction is based on the theory of itineraries of such curves. The itinerary of a curve in $L_n(1;z_1)$ is a finite word in the alphabet $S_{n+1} \smallsetminus \{e\}$ of nontrivial permutations.</description>

      <title>Turk's head knots and links: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We collect and discuss various results on an important family of knots and links called Turk's head knots and links $Th (p,q)$. In the mathematical literature, they also appear under different names such as rosette knots and links or weaving knots and links. Unless being the unknot or the alternating torus links $T(2,q)$, the Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are all known to be alternating, fibered, hyperbolic, invertible, non-split, periodic, and prime. The Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are also both positive and negative amphichiral if $p$ is chosen to be odd. Moreover, we highlight and present several more results, focusing on Turk's head knots $Th (3,q)$. We finally list several open problems and conjectures for Turk's head knots and links. We conclude with a short appendix on torus knots and links, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a finite presentation of the cobordism symmetric monoidal bicategory of (smooth, oriented) closed manifolds, cobordisms and cobordisms with corners as an extension of the bicategory of closed manifolds, cobordisms and diffeomorphisms. The generators are the standard handle attachments, and the relations are handle cancellations and invariance under reversing the orientation of the attaching spheres.
  In other words, given a categorified TQFT and 2-morphisms associated to the standard handles satisfying our relations, we construct a once extended TQFT.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit two examples of convex cocompact subgroups of the isometry groups of real hyperbolic spaces with limit set a Pontryagin sphere: one generated by $50$ reflections of $\mathbb{H}^4$, and the other by a rotation of order $21$ and a reflection of $\mathbb{H}^6$. For each of them, we also locate convex cocompact subgroups with limit set a Menger curve.</description>

      <title>A 2-torsion invariant of 2-knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe what should perhaps be called a `type-2' Vassiliev invariant of knots S^2 -&gt; S^4. We give a formula for an invariant of 2-knots, taking values in Z_2 that can be computed in terms of the double-point diagram of the knot. The double-point diagram is a collection of curves and diffeomorphisms of curves, in the domain S^2, that describe the crossing data with respect to a projection, analogous to a chord diagram for a projection of a classical knot S^1 -&gt; S^3. Our formula turns the computation of the invariant into a planar geometry problem. More generally, we describe a numerical invariant of families of knots S^j -&gt; S^n, for all n &gt;= j+2 and j &gt;= 1. In the co-dimension two case n=j+2 the invariant is an isotopy invariant, and either takes values in Z or Z_2 depending on a parity issue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charts are oriented labeled graphs in a disk. Any simple surface braid (2-dimensional braid) can be described by using a chart. Also, a chart represents an oriented closed surface embedded in 4-space. In this paper, we investigate embedded surfaces in 4-space by using charts.
  Let $\Gamma$ be a chart, and we denote by $Cross(\Gamma)$ the set of all the crossings of $\Gamma$, and we denote by $\Gamma_m$ the union of all the edges of label $m$. For a 4-chart $\Gamma$, if the closure of each connected component of the set $(\Gamma_1\cup \Gamma_3)-Cross(\Gamma)$ is acyclic, then $\Gamma$ is said to be {\it linear}. In this paper, we shall show that any linear minimal $4$-chart with three crossings is lor-equivalent (Label-Orientation-Reflection equivalent) to the chart describing a $2$-twist spun trefoil knot by omitting free edges and hoops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $f: M \to N$ a homotopy equivalence of compact manifolds with boundary, we use a construction of Geoghegan and Nicas to define its Reidemeister trace $[T] \in \pi_1^{st}(\mathcal{L} N, N)$. We realize the Goresky-Hingston coproduct as a map of spectra, and show that the failure of $f$ to entwine the spectral coproducts can be characterized by Chas-Sullivan multiplication with $[T]$. In particular, when $f$ is a simple homotopy equivalence, the spectral coproducts of $M$ and $N$ agree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum version of the $n$-dimer model from statistical mechanics, based on the formalism from quantum topology developed by Reshetikhin and Turaev (the latter which, in particular, can be used to construct the Jones polynomial of a knot in $\mathbb{R}^3$). We apply this machinery to construct an isotopy invariant polynomial for knotted bipartite ribbon graphs in $\mathbb{R}^3$, giving, in the planar setting, a quantum $n$-dimer partition function. As one application, we compute the expected number of loops in the (classical) double dimer model for planar bipartite graphs.</description>

  This result is a piecewise-linear counterpart of a long-standing problem about normals to smooth convex bodies.</description>
