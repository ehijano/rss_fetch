      <title>Uni-Mol3: A Multi-Molecular Foundation Model for Advancing Organic Reaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core, Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes 3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a 3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10 datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions. This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism understanding.</description>

      <title>Learning the action for long-time-step simulations of molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of classical mechanics can be used to model the time evolution of countless physical systems, from the astrophysical to the atomic scale. Accurate numerical integration requires small time steps, which limits the computational efficiency -- especially in cases such as molecular dynamics that span wildly different time scales. Using machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict trajectories allows one to greatly extend the integration time step, at the cost of introducing artifacts such as lack of energy conservation and loss of equipartition between different degrees of freedom of a system. We propose learning data-driven structure-preserving (symplectic and time-reversible) maps to generate long-time-step classical dynamics, showing that this method is equivalent to learning the mechanical action of the system of interest. We show that an action-derived ML integrator eliminates the pathological behavior of non-structure-preserving ML predictors, and that the method can be applied iteratively, serving as a correction to computationally cheaper direct predictors.</description>

      <title>The seeds of the future are in the present: A blind exploration of metastable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel type of molecular dynamics simulation that aims at discovering, in a blind way, new metastable states. Using only data coming from an initial unbiased simulation, and with the help of an appropriately defined loss function, we compute a bias that favors sampling yet unexplored configurational space regions, encouraging the system to leave the initial basin. In our work, we take advantage of what is normally thought to be a defect, namely the difficulty of neural networks to generalize. Contrary to most other enhanced sampling methods, which need previous knowledge of the reactive process, we are able to discover in a blind way new metastable states, overcoming otherwise insuperable kinetic bottlenecks. We illustrate the workings of the method with a number of instructive examples.</description>

      <title>Boosting hydrogen and methane formation on a high-entropy photocatalyst by integrating atomic d0/d10 electronic junctions and microscopic P/N heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of green energy carriers such as hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) via photocatalytic processes provides a clean method for addressing environmental and energy issues. To achieve highly efficient photocatalysts for H2 and CH4 generation, the present work introduces the P/N heterojunctions in a high-entropy oxide (HEO) with d0/d10 electronic junctions. The study uses CuO as a P-type semiconductor and the HEO containing d0 (Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta) and d10 (Zn) cations as an N-type semiconductor. The material exhibits improvements in optical properties, such as light absorption, charge mobility and reduced electron-hole recombination. The integration of two concepts, atomic-scale d0/d10 electronic junctions and micro-scale P/N heterojunctions, leads to enhanced H2 and CH4 production. Particularly after the partial removal of vacancies in the heterojunction, H2 production from photocatalytic water splitting reaches 0.71 mmol/g.h, and CH4 evolution from CO2 conversion reaches 2.40 umol/g.h with 72% selectivity for methanation. The integrated strategy of this study has a high potential in developing active heterostructured catalysts for clean fuel production.</description>

      <title>Quantitative and Predictive Folding Models from Limited Single-Molecule Data Using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of biomolecular folding has been greatly advanced by single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), which enables the observation of the dynamics of individual molecules. However, extracting quantitative models of fundamental properties such as folding landscapes from SNFS data is very challenging due to instrumental noise, linker artifacts, and the inherent stochasticity of the process, often requiring extensive datasets and complex calibration experiments. Here, we introduce a framework based on simulation-based inference (SBI) that overcomes these limitations by integrating physics-based modeling with deep learning. We apply this framework to analyze constant-force measurements of a DNA hairpin. From a single, short experimental trajectory of only two seconds, we successfully reconstruct the hairpin's free energy landscape and folding dynamics, obtaining results that are in close agreement with established deconvolution methods that require approximately 100 times more data. Furthermore, the Bayesian nature of this approach robustly quantifies uncertainties for inferred parameter values, including the free-energy profile, diffusion coefficients, and linker stiffness, without needing independent measurements of instrumental properties. The inferred model is predictive, generating simulated trajectories that quantitatively reproduce the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the experimental data. This work establishes SBI as a highly efficient and powerful tool for analyzing single-molecule experiments. The ability to derive statistically robust models from minimal datasets is crucial for investigating complex biomolecular systems where extensive data collection is impractical or impossible. Consequently, our SBI framework enables the rigorous quantitative analysis of previously intractable biomolecular systems, paving the way for novel applications of SMFS.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws Surpass Chemical Accuracy for the Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02570v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, that neural scaling laws can deliver near-exact solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation across a broad range of realistic molecules. This progress is enabled by the Lookahead Variational Algorithm (LAVA), an effective optimization scheme that systematically translates increased model size and computational resources into greatly improved energy accuracy for neural network wavefunctions. Across all tested cases, including benzene, the absolute energy error exhibits a systematic power-law decay with respect to model capacity and computation resources. The resulting energies not only surpass the 1 kcal/mol "chemical-accuracy" threshold but also achieve 1 kJ/mol subchemical accuracy. Beyond energies, the scaled-up neural network also yields better wavefunctions with improved physical symmetries, alongside accurate electron densities, dipole moments, and other important properties. Our approach offers a promising way forward to addressing many long-standing challenges in quantum chemistry. For instance, we improve energetic properties for systems such as the potential energy curve of nitrogen dimer as dissociation is approached and the cyclobutadiene automerization reaction barrier, producing definitive benchmarks, particularly in regimes where experimental data are sparse or highly uncertain. We also shed light on the decades-old puzzle of the cyclic ozone stability with highly accurate calculations for the cyclic-to-open ozone barrier. These results provide near-exact reference calculations with unprecedented accuracy, universal reliability and practical applicability, establishing a foundation for AI-driven quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>FastCSP: Accelerated Molecular Crystal Structure Prediction with Universal Model for Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role in applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is challenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large search space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few kJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) provides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a large number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source, high-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with geometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of 28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently generates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per molecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs can be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning. Moreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for classical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with DFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly lowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be obtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal structure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Open Molecular Crystals 2025 (OMC25) Dataset and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of accurate and efficient machine learning models for predicting the structure and properties of molecular crystals has been hindered by the scarcity of publicly available datasets of structures with property labels. To address this challenge, we introduce the Open Molecular Crystals 2025 (OMC25) dataset, a collection of over 27 million molecular crystal structures containing 12 elements and up to 300 atoms in the unit cell. The dataset was generated from dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) relaxation trajectories of over 230,000 randomly generated molecular crystal structures of around 50,000 organic molecules. OMC25 comprises diverse chemical compounds capable of forming different intermolecular interactions and a wide range of crystal packing motifs. We provide detailed information on the dataset's construction, composition, structure, and properties. To demonstrate the quality and use cases of OMC25, we further trained and evaluated state-of-the-art open-source machine learning interatomic potentials. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to accelerate the development of more accurate and efficient machine learning models for molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>Ultimate resolution limits in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering is a widely used imaging technique that provides chemical contrast without the need for labels, making it an extremely valuable tool in physics, chemistry, and biology. In this work, we explore its fundamental precision limits by applying tools from quantum information theory. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that spatial mode demultiplexing--a technique already accessible in current experimental setups--can achieve these quantum limits and in many situations improve the sensitivity of conventional intensity measurements. Building on this, we introduce an advanced imaging scheme based on vortex beams, which we predict to enhance the image information in the final quantum state of light and thereby lead to even higher resolution and sensitivity. These findings establish a clear path for enhancing nonlinear imaging techniques using concepts from quantum science, bridging the gap between established microscopy methods and the emerging capabilities of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>QCBench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Domain-Specific Quantitative Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research, enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry, bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields. QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Low Spin to High Spin Transition in a [2x2] Fe(II) Metallogrid: Diode Laser-Pumped Photocrystallography at the P11 Beamline in PETRA III, DESY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the photoinduced spin crossover (SCO) transition from a 2HS-2LS to a 3HS-1LS state in a [2x2] Fe(II) metallogrid complex using molecular crystals with static photocrystallography at a first ever attempt in the beamline P11 of the PETRA III synchrotron, DESY. A class 3B diode laser was used to induce the transition under controlled irradiation conditions. Structural characterization was achieved through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) measurements post-irradiation, revealing significant changes in average Fe-N distances, consistent with SCO behavior. Our experimental setup enables precise alignment necessary for photo-excitation using a class 3B diode laser along with a compact focusing optics. The longest dimension of the combined setup of the diode head and the focusing optics is not more than 32cm. The setup showcasing the utility of a compact diode laser system which can even be conveniently used in synchrotron-based pump-probe photocrystallography experiments for a wide range of molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking total energies with Hund's J terms in Hubbard-corrected spin-crossover chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions for their improvement.</description>

      <title>Complexation of a Thermoresponsive Brush-Type Polyelectrolyte with an Oppositely Charged Surfactant: Effect of Temperature and Surfactant Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Responsive drug delivery vectors can be designed using oppositely charged polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes. As a model, we created a brush-type copolymer (PECop), combining alginate and Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), whose side chains respond to temperature. Aggregation of PECop with the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) was examined versus surfactant concentration and temperature. We used surface tension, electrophoretic mobility, zeta potential, potentiometry, light scattering, and atomic force microscopy to analyze the complexes. PECop/DTAB complexes form spherical, monodisperse aggregates in certain surfactant ranges, even though the copolymer itself is polydisperse. The binding isotherms combine features of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte/surfactant systems and hydrophobically modified polymers. Compared to alginate alone, PECop binds six times more DTAB at 1 mM surfactant concentration. Temperature responsiveness depends on surfactant concentration (cs). The surfactant triggers progressive collapse of polymer chains, maximized at cs = 2.8 mM, where thermo-responsiveness is lost. For cs 10 mM, size increases above LCST. This inversion in thermal response with rising surfactant concentration suggests changing aggregate structure, offering new avenues for drug delivery system design using these polymer-surfactant complexes.</description>

      <title>Quantum chemistry with provable convergence via randomized sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a recently proposed algorithm to approximate the ground-state wave function of many-body quantum systems on near-term and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In SQD, the quantum computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. A recently proposed SQD variant, Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is concentrated, i.e., has support on a small subset of the full Hilbert space. Implementations of SKQD on current utility-scale quantum computers are limited by the depth of time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. For many complex many-body Hamiltonians of interest, such as the molecular electronic-structure Hamiltonian, this depth exceeds the capability of state-of-the-art quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a new SQD variant that combines SKQD with the qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables SQD calculations at the utility scale on chemical Hamiltonians while preserving the convergence guarantees of SKQD. We apply SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Rovibrational computation of H$_3^+$ with permutationally invariant Pekeris coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pekeris coordinates provide a permutationally invariant set of coordinates for H$_3^+$. They are defined as linear combinations of the three internuclear distances that automatically fulfil the triangle inequality for all non-negative coordinate values. In this work, we test three discrete variable representations (DVR) for tightly converging the rovibrational energies up to and beyond the barrier to linearity using the Pekeris coordinates. The best performing representation is a cot-DVR-type approach adapted to the Pekeris problem. The two- and three-proton near coalescence region, which is also part of the direct product Pekeris grid but dynamically not relevant, is avoided by coordinate mapping and regulator functions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields for Liquid and Materials Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a sophisticated tool for cost-efficient atomistic simulations approaching DFT accuracy, with recent message passing MLFFs able to cover the entire periodic table. We present an invariant message passing MLFF architecture (MPNICE) which iteratively predicts atomic partial charges, including long-range interactions, enabling the prediction of charge-dependent properties while achieving 5-20x faster inference versus models with comparable accuracy. We train direct and delta-learned MPNICE models for organic systems, and benchmark against experimental properties of liquid and solid systems. We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties. Finally, we explore multi-task models for both inorganic and organic systems, which exhibit slightly decreased performance on domain-specific tasks but surprising generalization, stably predicting the gas phase structure of $\simeq500$ Pt/Ir organometallic complexes despite never training to organometallic complexes of any kind.</description>

      <title>The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.</description>

      <title>Enhanced 133cs Triple-Quantum Excitation in Solid-State NMR of Cs-Bearing Zeolites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geopolymers are aluminosilicate materials that exhibit effective immobilization properties for low-level radioactive nuclear waste, and more specifically for the immobilization of radioactive cesium. The identification of the cesium-binding sites and their distribution between the different phases making up the geopolymeric matrix can be obtained using solid-state NMR measurements of the quadrupolar spin 133Cs, which is a surrogate for the radioactive cesium species present in nuclear waste streams. For quadrupolar nuclei, acquiring two-dimensional multiple-quantum experiments allows the acquisition of more dispersed spectra when multiple sites overlap. However, 133Cs has a spin-7/2 and one of the smallest quadrupole moments, making multiple-quantum excitation highly challenging. In this work we present pulse schemes that enhance the excitation efficiency of 133Cs triple quantum coherences by a factor of ~2 with respect to a two-pulse excitation scheme. The improved schemes were developed by using numerical simulation and verified experimentally by applying one and two-dimensional triple-quantum solid-state NMR experiments to a mixture of cesium-exchanged hydrated zeolites A and X, which possess dynamically averaged small quadrupolar coupling constants in the order of 10 kHz.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum dynamics of methanol: full-dimensional ab initio potential energy surface of spectroscopic quality and variational vibrational states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The methanol molecule is a sensitive probe of astrochemistry, astrophysics, and fundamental physics. The first-principles elucidation and prediction of its rotation-torsional-vibrational motions are enabled in this work by the computation of a full-dimensional, \emph{ab initio} potential energy surface (PES) and numerically exact quantum dynamics. An active-learning approach is used to sample explicitly correlated coupled-cluster electronic energies, and the datapoints are fitted with permutationally invariant polynomials to obtain a spectroscopic-quality PES representation. Variational vibrational energies and corresponding tunnelling splittings are computed up to the first overtone of the C-O stretching mode by direct numerical solution of the vibrational Schr\"odinger equation with optimal internal coordinates and efficient basis and grid truncation techniques. As a result, the computed vibrational band origins finally agree with experiment within 5 cm$^{-1}$, allowing for the exploration of the large-amplitude quantum mechanical motion and tunnelling splittings coupled with the small-amplitude vibrational dynamics. These developments open the route towards simulating rovibrational spectra used to probe methanol in outer space and in precision science laboratories, as well as for probing interactions with external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Shake-down spectroscopy as state- and site-specific probe of ultrafast chemical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracking the multifarious ultrafast electronic and structural changes occurring in a molecule during a photochemical transformation is a challenging endeavor that benefits from recent experimental and computational progress in time-resolved techniques. Measurements of valence electronic states, which provide a global picture of the bonding structure of the molecule, and core electronic states, which provide insight into the local environment, traditionally require different approaches and are often studied separately. Here, we demonstrate that X-ray pulses from a seeded free-electron laser (FEL) enable the measurement of high-resolution, time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) that capture weak satellite states resulting from shake-down processes in a valence-excited molecule. This approach effectively combines the advantages of both valence- and core-state investigations. We applied this method to investigate photoexcited CS$_2$ molecules, where the role of internal conversion (IC) and intersystem crossing (ISC) in determining the pre-dissociation dynamics is controversial. We present XPS spectra from photoexcited CS$_2$, obtained at the FERMI FEL. High-resolution measurements, compared to the corresponding spectra obtained from accurate multireference quantum chemical calculations, reveal that shake-down satellite channels are highly sensitive to both valence electronic and geometric changes. Previous studies of the pre-dissociation dynamics have led to uncertain assignments of the branching between singlet and triplet excited states. We derive a propensity rule that demonstrates the spin-selectivity of the shake-downs. This selectivity allows us to unequivocally assign contributions from the bright and dark singlet excited states, with populations tracked along the pre-dissociation dynamic pathway.</description>

      <title>Geometric direct minimization for low-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that configuration state functions (CSF) with local orbitals can provide a compact reference state for low-spin open-shell electronic structures, such as antiferromagnetic states. However, optimizing a low-spin configuration using self-consistent field (SCF) theory has been a long-standing challenge, since each orbital must be an eigenfunction of a different Fock operator. Here, I introduce a low-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) algorithm to optimize any CSF at mean-field cost. This algorithm employs quasi-Newton Riemannian optimization on the orbital constraint manifold to provide robust convergence, extending the Geometric Direct Minimization approach to open-shell electronic structures with arbitrary genealogical spin coupling. Numerical calculations on transition metal aquo complexes show improved convergence over existing methodology, while the possibility of local CSF energy minima is demonstrated for iron-sulfur complexes. Finally, open-shell CSFs with different spin coupling patterns are used to qualitatively study the singlet ground state in polyacenes, revealing the onset of polyradical character for increasing chain length.</description>

      <title>On the Simulation of Conical Intersections in Water and Methanimine Molecules Via Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of methanimine (CH2NH) and water (H2O) molecules in an effort to locate conical intersections (CIs) using variational quantum algorithms. Our approach implements and compares a range of hybrid quantum-classical methods, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), VQE with Automatically-Adjusted Constraints (VQE-AC), and we explore molecular configurations of interest using a State-Average (SA) approach. Exact Diagonalization is employed as the classical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the quantum algorithms. We perform simulations across a range of molecular geometries, basis sets, and active spaces to compare each algorithm's performance and accuracy, and to enhance the detectability of CIs. This work confirms the quantum variational algorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules, as long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen. We also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing excited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good agreement within desired regions.</description>
