      <title>A First Look at Spatially Resolved Star Formation at $4.8&lt;z&lt;6.5$ with JWST FRESCO NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results on the spatial distribution of star formation in 454 star-forming galaxies at $4.8&lt;z&lt;6.5$ using H-Alpha emission-line maps and F444W imaging tracing the stellar continuum from the JWST FRESCO NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy Survey. Star-forming galaxies with stellar masses $6.8\leq$log($M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$)$&lt;11.1$ have positive H-Alpha equivalent width profiles, providing direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies just after the epoch of reionisation. GALFIT is used to calculate half-light radii, $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and central surface densities within 1 kiloparsec, $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc}}$ of H-Alpha and the continuum. At a fixed stellar mass of log$(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})=9.5$, $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha}$ is $1.3\pm0.1$ times higher than $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, C}}$ with consistent H-Alpha and continuum $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ that are both less than 1 kpc. These measurements suggest the rapid build up of compact bulges without a significant increase in their radii. By comparing to work done at lower redshifts with HST WFC3 Slitless Spectroscopy as part of the 3D-HST ($z=1$) and CLEAR ($z=0.5$) surveys, we find that $R_{\mathrm{eff}}(z)$ and $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc}}(z)$ evolve faster with redshift for H-Alpha. As a function of the Hubble parameter, $\frac{R_{\mathrm{eff, H}\alpha}}{R_{\mathrm{eff, C}}}=1.1h(z)^{-0.1}$ and $\frac{\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,H}\alpha}}{\Sigma _{1\mathrm{kpc,C}}}=h(z)^{0.3}$. These functions indicate there is a transition point at $2&lt;z&lt;4$ where the inside-out growth of the disk starts to dominate over the inside-out growth of the bulge towards lower redshifts. This is supported by the redshift evolution in EW(H$\alpha$) profiles, where there is rapid increase in EW(H$\alpha$) with radius within the half-light radius at $z=5.3$ but only significantly increasing EW(H$\alpha$) with radius in the outer disk at $z=0.5$.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes with PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most active phases of star formation and black hole accretion are strongly affected by dust extinction, making far-infrared (far-IR) observations the best way to disentangle and study the co-evolution of galaxies and super massive black holes. The plethora of fine structure lines and emission features from dust, ionised and neutral atomic and warm molecular gas in the rest-frame mid- and far-IR provide unmatched diagnostic power to determine the properties of gas and dust, measure gas-phase metallicities and map cold galactic outflows in even the most obscured galaxies. By combining multi-band photometric surveys with low and high-resolution far-IR spectroscopy, the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA), a concept for a far-IR, 1.8m-diameter, cryogenically cooled observatory, will revolutionise the field of galaxy evolution by taking advantage of this IR toolkit to find and study dusty galaxies across galactic time. In this work, we make use of the phenomenological simulation SPRITZ and the Santa Cruz semi-analytical model to describe how a moderately deep multi-band PRIMA photometric survey can easily reach beyond previous IR missions to detect and study galaxies down to $10^{11}\,L_{\odot}$ beyond cosmic noon and at least up to z=4, even in the absence of gravitational lensing. By decomposing the spectral energy distribution (SED) of these photometrically selected galaxies, we show that PRIMA can be used to accurately measure the relative AGN power, the mass fraction contributed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and the total IR luminosity. At the same time, spectroscopic follow up with PRIMA will allow to trace both the star formation and black hole accretion rates (SFR, BHAR), the gas phase metallicities and the mass outflow rates of cold gas in hundreds to thousands of individual galaxies to z=2.</description>

      <title>The Rotation Curve and Spiral Structure of Milky Way from the Hydrogen 21-cm Line Detection with Campus Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation curve is significant to research on dark matter and the structure of the Milky Way. But it is a great challenge to measure rotation curve accurately, and different ways obtain distinct results. In this work, we use a DIY small radio telescope to carry out hydrogen 21-cm line observations on campus, and calculate the rotation curve of inner disk by tangent method based on the model of Przemek et al. (the rotation speed of the Sun $v(R_0)=233.6\pm2.8$ km/s, and distance to the Galactic center $R_0=8.122\pm0.031$ kpc). Furthermore, we obtain the distribution of spiral arms in the Milky Way with our data by adopting different rotation curve models. We also compare our rotation curve result with previous works, analyse the possible measurement error in the tangent method, and discuss the consistence of our result with others.</description>

      <title>Widespread rapid quenching at cosmic noon revealed by JWST deep spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive quiescent galaxies in the young universe are expected to be quenched rapidly, but it is unclear whether they all experience starbursts before quenching and what physical mechanism drives rapid quenching. We study 16 massive quiescent galaxies ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &gt; 10$) at $z\sim2$ selected from a representative sample of the Blue Jay survey. We reconstruct their star formation histories by fitting spectral energy distribution models to the JWST/NIRSpec $R\sim1000$ spectra. We find that massive quiescent galaxies can be split into three categories with roughly equal numbers of galaxies according to their SFHs: 1) Relatively old galaxies quenched at early epochs; 2) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a flat or bursty formation history (depending on the assumed prior); 3) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a major starburst. Most recently quenched galaxies show neutral gas outflows, probed by blueshifted $\rm Na\,I\,D$ absorption, and ionized gas emission, with line ratios consistent with active galactic nucleus (AGN) diagnostics. This suggests that AGN activity drives multi-phase gas outflows, leading to rapid quenching. By tracing back the SFHs of the entire sample, we predict the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at $z=4-6$: $n=3.0\pm1.4\times10^{-5}\,\rm Mpc^{-3}$. The two oldest massive quiescent galaxies in our sample appear to have extremely early formation and quenching ($z\gtrsim6$), possibly descendants of early post-starbursts at $z&gt;3$. These galaxies still show neutral gas reservoirs and low-level star formation, consistent with weak H$\alpha$ emission, perhaps because the ejective AGN feedback that caused rapid quenching has weakened over time.</description>

      <title>Multiline observations of hydrogen, helium, and carbon radio-recombination lines toward Orion A: A detailed dynamical study and direct determination of physical conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of hydrogen, helium, and carbon millimeter-wave radio-recombination lines (RRLs) toward ten representative positions throughout the Orion Nebula complex, using the Yebes 40m telescope in the Q band (31.3 GHz to 50.6 GHz) at an angular resolution of about $45\arcsec$ ($\sim$0.09\,pc). The observed positions include the Orion Nebula (M42) with the Orion Molecular Core 1, M43, and the Orion Molecular Core 3 bordering on NGC 1973, 1975, and 1977. While hydrogen and helium RRLs arise in the ionized gas surrounding the massive stars in the Orion Nebula complex, carbon RRLs stem from the neutral gas of the adjacent photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). The high velocity resolution ($0.3\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) enables us to discern the detailed dynamics of the RRL emitting neutral and ionized gas. We compare the carbon RRLs with SOFIA/upGREAT observations of the [CII] $158\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ line and IRAM 30m observations of the $^{13}$CO (J=2-1) line. Using the [CII] and [$^{13}$CII] intensities with the carbon RRL intensities, we can infer physical conditions (electron temperature and electron density) in the PDR gas using non-LTE excitation models. Our observations are sensitive enough to detect faint lines toward two positions in OMC1, that may be attributed to RRLs of C$^+$ or O$^+$. In general, the RRL line widths of both the ionized and neutral gas, as well as the [CII] and $^{13}$CO line widths, are broader than thermal, indicating significant turbulence in the interstellar medium, which transitions from super-Alfv\'enic and subsonic in the ionized gas to sub-Alfv\'enic and supersonic in the molecular gas. At the scales probed by our observations, the turbulent pressure dominates the pressure balance in the neutral and molecular gas, while in the ionized gas the turbulent pressure is much smaller than the thermal pressure.</description>

      <title>Evidence that Eddington ratio depends upon a supermassive black hole's mass and redshift: Implications for radiative efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presently, it is unclear whether the Eddington ratio and radiative efficiency depend upon a supermassive black hole's (SMBH's) redshift z and mass MBH. We attempt to resolve this issue using published data for 132,000 SMBHs with MBH &gt;1E+7 Msun (solar masses) at ~0.1&lt;z&lt;2.4 covering ~10 billion years of cosmic time, with MBH determined using MgII lines and bolometric luminosities (Lbol) based on a weighted mean of Lbol from two or more monochromatic luminosities and a single uniformly applied correction factor. The SMBHs are sorted into 7 MBH bins separated from each other by half an order of magnitude. The Eddington ratio and z data in each bin are subjected to spline regression analysis. The results unambiguously show that for similar-size SMBHs, the Eddington ratio decreases as z decreases and that for a given redshift larger SMBHs have a lower Eddington ratio. These findings require that either a SMBH's accretion rate and/or its radiative efficiency be a function of z and MBH and, in the context of the Bondi accretion model, imply that radiative efficiency is an inverse function of a SMBH's redshift z and mass MBH. These findings suggest that SMBHs become less efficient (higher radiative efficiency) in accreting gases as the ambient gas density decreases with z and that larger SMBHs are more efficient (lower radiative efficiency) than smaller ones. The results leave little doubt that the current widespread practice of assigning radiative efficiency a standard value is untenable and gives erroneous estimates of accretion rates and growth times of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Superbubbles as the source of dynamical friction: gas migration, stellar and dark matter contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas distribution in galaxies is smooth on large scales but is usually inhomogeneous as well as time-dependent on smaller scales. The time-dependence originates from processes such as cloud formation, their collisions and supernovae (SNe) explosions. The inhomogeneities in the matter distribution give rise to variations in the local galactic gravitational potential, which can contribute towards dynamically coupling the gas disk to the stellar and the dark matter (DM) components of the galaxy. Specifically, multiple supernovae occurring in young stellar clusters give rise to superbubbles (SB), which modify the local acceleration field and alter the energy and momentum of stars of DM particles traversing them, in broad analogy to the dynamical friction caused by a massive object. We aim to quantify how the acceleration field from SBs causes dynamical friction and contributes to the secular evolution of galaxies. In order to assess this, we construct the density modifications to the gas distribution that mimics a SB. By evaluating the acceleration field from these density modifications, we see how the momentum or angular momentum of the gas hosting the SBs changes when stars pass through the SB. Combining the effects of all the stars and SBs we, construct an empirical approximation formula for the momentum loss in homogeneous and isotropic cases. We find that the rate at which the gas disc loses its specific angular momentum via the above process is up to 4% per Gyr, which translates to under half of its original value over the lifetime of the disc. Finally, we studied how the dynamical coupling of the gas disk with the DM halo depends on assumptions on the halo kinematics (e.g. rotation) and found a ~0.3% variation in the gas disc secular evolution between different DM kinematic models.</description>

      <title>New quasars behind the Magellanic Clouds. II. Spectroscopic confirmation of 136 near-infrared selected candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) are a basis for an absolute reference system for astrometric studies. There is a need for creating such system behind nearby galaxies, to facilitate the measuring of the proper motions of these galaxies. However, the foreground contamination from the galaxies themselves is a problem for the QSO identification. We search for new QSOs behind both Magellanic Clouds, the Magellanic Bridge, and the Magellanic Stream. We identify QSO candidates with a combination of near-infrared colors and variability criteria from the public ESO Visual and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Magellanic Clouds (VMC) survey. We confirm their nature from broad emission lines with low-resolution optical spectroscopy. We confirmed the QSO nature of 136 objects. They are distributed as follows: 12 behind the LMC, 37 behind the SMC, 63 behind the Bridge, and 24 behind the Stream. The QSOs span a redshift range from z~0.1 to z~2.9. A comparison of our quasar selection with the Quaia quasar catalog, based on Gaia low-resolution spectra, yields a selection and confirmation success rate of 6-19%, depending on whether the quality of the photometry, the magnitude ranges and the colors are considered. Our candidate list is rather incomplete, but the objects in it are likely to be confirmed as quasars with ~90% probability. Finally, we report a list of 3609 objects across the entire VMC survey that match our color and variability selection criteria; only 1249 of them have Gaia counterparts. Our combined infrared color and variability criteria for QSO selection prove to be efficient - ~90% of the observed candidates are bona fide QSOs and allow to generate a list of new high-probability quasar candidates.</description>

      <title>Inhibited destruction of dust by supernova in a clumpy medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decrease rate of dust mass due to strong shock waves ($v_s\geq 150$ km s$^{-1}$) from supernovae (SNe) estimated for the Milky Way interstellar medium significantly exceeds the overall production rate by both asymptotic giant branch stars and core collapse SNe. The interplay between the production and destruction rates is critically important for evaluation of the net dust outcome from SNe at different conditions. In light of this, we study the dynamics of initially polydisperse dust grains pre-existed in an ambient medium swept up the SN shock front depending on magnitude of inhomogeneity (clumpiness) in {the} medium. We find that dust destruction inside the bubble is inhibited in more inhomogeneous medium: the larger amount of dust survives for the higher dispersion of density. This trend is set by the interrelation between radiative gas cooling and dust sputtering in different environment. After several radiative times the mass fraction of the survived dust saturates at the level almost independent on the gas mean density. We note that for more clumpy medium the distributions of dust over thermal phases of a gas inside the bubble and over sizes are smoother and flatter in comparison with those in a nearly homogeneous medium.</description>

      <title>Studies of stationary features in jets: BL Lacertae II. Trajectory reversals and superluminal speeds on sub-parsec scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High resolution VLBI observations revealed a quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the relativistic jets of many blazars, which represents a standing recollimation shock. The VLBA monitoring of the BL Lacertae jet at 15~GHz shows the QSC at a projected distance of about 0.26~mas from the radio core. We study the trajectory and kinematics of the QSC in BL Lacertae on sub-parsec scales using 15~GHz VLBA maps of 164 observations over 20 years from the MOJAVE program and 2~cm VLBA Survey. To reconstruct the QSC's intrinsic trajectory, we use moving average and trajectory refinement procedures to smooth out the effects of core displacement and account for QSC positioning errors. We identified 22 QSC reversal patterns on spatial scales ranging from 0.01~mas to 0.05~mas and with a frequency of $\sim 1.5$ per year. Most reversals have an acute angle $&lt;90\degr$ at the turning point, and few have a loop-shaped or arc-shaped trajectory. The directions of reversals (clockwise or counterclockwise) appear to be random. Combinations of reversals show reversible and quasi-periodic motion. We propose a model in which the reverse motion of the QSC is due to the passage of a relativistic transverse jet wave through a fixed location of the QSC, similar to the transverse motion of a seagull on a wave. The QSC motion is governed by the amplitude, velocity, and tilt of the relativistic transverse wave. According to the model, relativistic waves are generated upstream of QSC. In the active state of the jet, the directions of the twisting waves are random, similar to the behaviour of the wave in a high-pressure hose, while in the jet stable state, the wave makes quasi-periodic oscillations with regular twisting. In this model the transverse speed of the QSC in the host galaxy frame is subluminal ($&lt;0.3\,c$), but to an observer it appears superluminal ($\sim 2\,c$).</description>

      <title>Turbulence statistics of HI clouds entrained in the Milky Way's nuclear wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) is ubiquitously turbulent across many physically distinct environments within the Galaxy. Turbulence is key in controlling the structure and dynamics of the ISM, regulating star formation, and transporting metals within the Galaxy. We present the first observational measurements of turbulence in neutral hydrogen entrained in the hot nuclear wind of the Milky Way. Using recent MeerKAT observations of two extra-planar HI clouds above (gal. lat.$\,\sim7.0^{\circ}$) and below (gal. lat.$\,\sim-3.9^{\circ}$) the Galactic disc, we analyse centroid velocity and column density maps to estimate the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v,\mathrm{3D}}$), the turbulent sonic Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), the volume density dispersion ($\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$), and the turbulence driving parameter ($b$). We also present a new prescription for estimating the spatial temperature variations of HI in the presence of related molecular gas. We measure these turbulence quantities on the global scale of each cloud, but also spatially map their variation across the plane-of-sky extent of each cloud by using a roving kernel method. We find that the two clouds share very similar characteristics of their internal turbulence, despite their varying latitudes. Both clouds are in the sub-to-trans-sonic Mach regime, and have primarily compressively-driven ($b\sim1$) turbulence. Given that there is no known active star-formation present in these clouds, this may be indicative of the way the cloud-wind interaction injects energy into the entrained atomic material on parsec scales.</description>

Abstract: From $\sim$ 5000 deg$^{2}$ of the combination of the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS) and Mayall $z$-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) which is also the northern sky region of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys, we selected a sample of 31,825 candidates of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) with the mean effective surface brightness 24.2 $&lt; \bar{\mu}_{\rm eff,g} &lt;$ 28.8 mag arcsec$^{\rm -2}$ and the half-light radius 2.5$^{\prime\prime}$ $&lt; r_{\rm eff} &lt;$ 20$^{\prime\prime}$ based on the released photometric catalogue and the machine learning model. The distribution of the LSBGs is of bimodality in the $g$ - $r$ color, indicating the two distinct populations of the blue ($g$ - $r &lt;$ 0.60) and the red ($g$ - $r &gt;$ 0.60) LSBGs. The blue LSBGs appear spiral, disk or irregular while the red LSBGs are spheroidal or ellipitcal and spatially clustered. This trend shows that the color has a strong correlation with galaxy morphology for LSBGs. In the spatial distribution, the blue LSBGs are more uniformly distributed while the red ones are highly clustered, indicating that red LSBGs preferentially populated denser environment than the blue LSBGs. Besides, both populations have consistent distribution of ellipticity (median $\epsilon\sim$ 0.3), half-light radius (median $r_{\rm eff} \sim$ 4$^{\prime\prime}$), and Sersic index (median $n$ = 1), implying the dominance of the full sample by the round and disk galaxies. This sample has definitely extended the studies of LSBGs to a regime of lower surface brightness, fainter magnitude, and broader other properties than the previously SDSS-based samples.</description>

      <title>Excitation mechanisms of C II optical permitted lines in ionized nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and its distribution is critical to understanding stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In optical studies of ionized nebulae, the only way to determine the C/H abundance is by using faint CII recombination lines (RLs). However, these lines give systematically higher abundances than their collisionally excited counterparts, observable at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Therefore, a proper understanding of the excitation mechanisms of the faint permitted lines is crucial for addressing this long-standing abundance discrepancy (AD) problem. Aims. In this study, we investigate the excitation mechanisms of CII lines {\lambda}{\lambda}3918, 3920, 4267, 5342, 6151, 6462, 7231, 7236, 7237 and 9903. Methods. We use the DEep Spectra of Ionized REgions Database (DESIRED) that contains spectra of HII regions, planetary nebulae and other objects to analyze the fluorescence contributions to these lines and the accuracy of the atomic recombination data used to model the C+ ion. Results. We find that CII {\lambda}{\lambda}4267, 5342, 6151, 6462 and 9903 arise exclusively from recombinations with no fluorescent contributions. In addition, the recombination theory for these lines is consistent with the observations. Our findings show that the AD problem for C2+ is not due to fluorescence in the widely used CII lines or errors in their atomic parameters, but to other phenomena like temperature variations or chemical inhomogeneities. On the other hand, CII {\lambda}{\lambda}3918, 3920, 6578, 7231, 7236, 7237 have important fluorescent contributions, which are inadvisable for tracing the C2+ abundances. We also discuss the effects of possible inconsistencies in the atomic effective recombination coefficients of CII {\lambda}{\lambda}6578, 7231, 7236 and 7237.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive kinematic model of the LMC disk from star clusters and field stars using Gaia DR3: Tracing the disk characteristics, rotation, bar, and the outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal kinematics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk have been modeled by several studies using different tracers with varying coverage, resulting in a range of parameters. Here, we modeled the LMC disk using 1705 star clusters and field stars, based on a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, using the Gaia DR3 data. The dependency of model parameters on the age, coverage, and strength of the clusters are also presented. This is the first comprehensive 2D kinematic study using star clusters. Red clump (RC) stars and young main-sequence stars are also modeled for comparison. The clusters and field stars are found to have distinctly different kinematic centers, disk inclination, position angle of the line of nodes, and scale radius. We also note a significant radial variation of the disk parameters. Clusters and young stars are found to have a large residual proper motion and a relatively large velocity dispersion when compared to the RC field population, which could be due to perturbation from the bar and spiral arms. We traced the presence of large residual proper motion and non-circular motion among clusters likely to be due to the bar and detected a decrease in the scale radius as a result of the possible evolution of the bar. The kinematically deviant clusters point to a spatio-temporal disturbance in the LMC disk, matching with the expected impact factor and time of the recent collision between the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy with SPH simulations: I. Stellar feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question regarding the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is the identification of the key physical mechanisms responsible for gas depletion. Here, we focus on the study of stellar feedback in isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, by performing numerical simulations using a modified version of the SPH code GADGET-3. The Milky Way satellite Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group was considered as our default model dwarf galaxy. The parameter space for the stellar feedback models was explored to match observational constraints of Leo II, such as residual gas mass, total mass within the tidal radius, star formation history, final stellar mass, stellar ages and metallicity. Additionally, we examined the impact of the binary fraction of stars, initial mass function, dark matter halo mass and initial gas reservoir. Many simulations revealed recent star formation quenching due to stellar feedback. In general, the gas depletion, expected star formation history, total mass of stars and total mass within the tidal radius were adequately reproduced in the simulations when compared to observational estimates. However, there were discrepancies in the distribution of stellar ages and metallicities, which suggested that the cosmic gas infall would play a more complex role in our dwarf spheroidal galaxy than captured by a monolithic infall scenario. Our results suggest that currently quenched dwarf galaxies may not necessarily need to evolve within clusters or groups, and that stellar feedback alone could be a sufficient factor in shaping at least some of these galaxies as we observe them today.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in the quasi-linear formulation of MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We explore the dynamical friction on a test mass in gravitational systems in the Quasi linear formulation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (QuMOND). Methods. Exploiting the quasi linearity of QuMOND we derive a simple expression for the dynamical friction in akin to its Newtonian counterpart in the standard Chandrasekhar derivation. Moreover, adopting a mean field approach based on the Liouville equation we obtain a more rigorous (though in integral form) dynamical friction formula that can be evaluated numerically for a given choice of the QuMOND interpolation function. Results. Consistently with previous work, we observe that dynamical friction is stronger in MOND with respect to a baryon only Newtonian system with the same mass distribution. This amounts to a correction of the Coulomb logarithmic factor via extra terms proportional to the MOND radius of the system. Moreover, with the aid of simple numerical experiments we confirm our theoretical predictions and those of previous work on MOND.</description>

      <title>Broadband Multi-wavelength Properties of M87 during the 2018 EHT Campaign including a Very High Energy Flaring Episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nearby elliptical galaxy M87 contains one of the only two supermassive black holes whose emission surrounding the event horizon has been imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In 2018, more than two dozen multi-wavelength (MWL) facilities (from radio to gamma-ray energies) took part in the second M87 EHT campaign. The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010. The flux above 350 GeV has more than doubled within a period of about 36 hours. We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image. Our results show the value of continued MWL monitoring together with precision imaging for addressing the origins of high-energy particle acceleration. While we cannot currently pinpoint the precise location where such acceleration takes place, the new VHE gamma-ray flare already presents a challenge to simple one-zone leptonic emission model approaches, and emphasises the need for combined image and spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>The NuSTAR Serendipitous Survey: the 80-month catalog and source properties of the high-energy emitting AGN and quasar population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of hard X-ray serendipitous sources detected in the first 80 months of observations by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). The NuSTAR serendipitous survey 80-month (NSS80) catalog has an unprecedented $\sim$ 62 Ms of effective exposure time over 894 unique fields (a factor of three increase over the 40-month catalog), with an areal coverage of $\sim $36 deg$^2$, larger than all NuSTAR extragalactic surveys. NSS80 provides 1274 hard X-ray sources in the $3-24$ keV band (822 new detections compared to the previous 40-month catalog). Approximately 76% of the NuSTAR sources have lower-energy ($&lt;10$ keV) X-ray counterparts from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift-XRT. We have undertaken an extensive campaign of ground-based spectroscopic follow-up to obtain new source redshifts and classifications for 427 sources. Combining these with existing archival spectroscopy provides redshifts for 550 NSS80 sources, of which 547 are classified. The sample is primarily composed of active galactic nuclei (AGN), detected over a large range in redshift ($z$ = 0.012-3.43), but also includes 58 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic sources. In addition, five AGN/galaxy pairs, one dual AGN system, one BL Lac candidate, and a hotspot of 4C 74.26 (radio quasar) have been identified. The median rest-frame $10-40$ keV luminosity and redshift of the NSS80 are $\langle{L_\mathrm{10-40 keV}}\rangle$ = 1.2 $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $\langle z \rangle = 0.56$. We investigate the optical properties and construct composite optical spectra to search for subtle signatures not present in the individual spectra, finding an excess of redder BL AGN compared to optical quasar surveys predominantly due to the presence of the host-galaxy and, at least in part, due to dust obscuration.</description>

      <title>Shaping the nebula around the symbiotic system R Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-dispersion spectroscopic observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) obtained with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) at the 2.1 m telescope of the San Pedro M\'artir Observatory (Mexico). An interpretation of these data is presented by means of the shape software to disclose the morpho-kinematics of the nebulosities associated with R Aqr. The best model that reproduces narrow-band images and position-velocity diagrams is composed by three structures: an outer (large) hourglass structure surrounding an inner bipolar with a spiral-like filament entwined around the later. Different expansion velocity patterns are predefined for each structure, which predict kinematic ages of $\tau_{1}$=450$\pm$25 yr (outer hourglass), $\tau_{2}$=240$\pm$20 yr (inner bipolar) and $\tau_{3}$=215$\pm$20 yr (spiral-like filament). We suggest that the spiral-like filament is tracing the regions of interaction of the precessing jet with the circumstellar material, which simultaneously carves the inner bipolar structure. If a similar process created the large hourglass structure, it means that the action of the jet ceased for about 230 yr. We discuss the implication for other unresolved symbiotic systems detected in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Luminous giants populate the dense Cosmic Web: The radio luminosity-environmental density relation for radio galaxies in action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant radio galaxies (GRGs, giant RGs, or giants) are megaparsec-scale, jet-driven outflows from accretion disks of supermassive black holes, and represent the most extreme pathway by which galaxies can impact the Cosmic Web around them. A long-standing but unresolved question is why giants are so much larger than other radio galaxies. It has been proposed that, in addition to having higher jet powers than most RGs, giants might live in especially low-density Cosmic Web environments. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis by pinpointing Local Universe giants and other RGs in physically principled, Bayesian large-scale structure reconstructions. More specifically, we localised a LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2-dominated sample of luminous ($l_\nu(\nu = 150\ \mathrm{MHz}) \geq 10^{24}\ \mathrm{W\ Hz^{-1}}$) giants and a control sample of LoTSS DR1 RGs, both with spectroscopic redshifts up to $z_\mathrm{max} = 0.16$, in the BORG SDSS Cosmic Web reconstructions. We measured the Cosmic Web density for each RG; for the control sample, we then quantified the relation between RG radio luminosity and Cosmic Web density. With the BORG SDSS tidal tensor, we also measured for each RG whether the gravitational dynamics of its Cosmic Web environment resemble those of clusters, filaments, sheets, or voids. Luminous giants populate large-scale environments that tend to be denser than those of general RGs. This shows that -- at least at high jet powers -- low-density environments are no prerequisite for giant growth. This result is corroborated by gravitational dynamics classification and a cluster catalogue crossmatching analysis. This work presents more than a thousand inferred megaparsec-scale densities around radio galaxies. Our findings are consistent with the view that giants are regular, rather than mechanistically special, members of the radio galaxy population.</description>

Abstract: We study the linear stability of regular $n$-gon rotating equilibria in the $n$-body problem with logarithm interaction. In the presence of a central mass $M$, linear stability is insured if $M$ is bounded below and above by constants depending on the number and mass of the (equal) outer $n$ bodies. Moreover, we provide explicit equations of these bounds. In the absence of a central mass we find that the regular $n$-gon is linearly stable for $n =2,3,\ldots 6$ only.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a [O III] Emission Shell Around the X-ray Binary CI Cam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of a $8' \times 12'$ emission shell brightest in [O III] centered on the X-ray binary B[e] star, CI Cameleopardalis (CI Cam). This shell, detected during a survey of optical emission associated with the Galactic supernova remnant G150.3+4.5, is seen outside but immediately adjacent to the remnant's optical filaments along its northwestern edge. Assuming this shell is related to CI Cam's strong winds and transient outbursts, the adoption of CI Cam's Gaia DR3 statistically corrected distance of 4.1$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ kpc yields shell dimensions $\simeq$ 9.5 pc $\times$ 14.3 pc. While the distance to the G150.3+4.5 remnant is uncertain, the appearance of CI Cam's emission shell so close to the SNR's optical filaments appears likely to be a chance coincidence.</description>

      <title>The Asymmetric Bipolar Fe II Jet and H2 Outflow of TMC1A Resolved with JWST's NIRSpec IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) Protostellar outflows exhibit large variations in their structure depending on the observed gas emission. This study analyzes the atomic jet and molecular outflow in the Class I protostar, TMC1A to characterize morphology and identify previously undetected spatial features with JWST's NIRSpec IFU. In addition to identifying a large number of Fe II and H2 lines, we have detected the bipolar Fe jet by revealing, for the first time, the presence of a red-shifted atomic jet. Similarly, the red-shifted component of the H2 slower wide-angle outflow is observed. Both Fe II and H2 red-shifted emission exhibit significantly lower flux densities compared to their blue-shifted counterparts. Additionally, we report the detection of a collimated high-velocity (100 km s-1), blue-shifted H2 outflow, suggesting the presence of a molecular jet in addition to the well-known wider angle low-velocity structure. The Fe II and H2 jets show multiple intensity peaks along the jet axis, which may be associated with ongoing or recent outburst events. In addition to the variation in their intensities, the H2 wide-angle outflow exhibits a "ring"-like structure. The blue-shifted H2 outflow also shows a left-right brightness asymmetry likely due to interactions with the surrounding ambient medium and molecular outflows. Using the Fe II line ratios, the extinction along the atomic jet is estimated to be between Av = 10-30 on the blue-shifted side, with a trend of decreasing extinction with distance from the protostar. A similar Av is found for the red-shifted side, supporting the argument for an intrinsic red-blue outflow lobe asymmetry rather than environmental effects such as extinction. This intrinsic difference revealed by the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST, suggests that younger outflows already exhibit the red-blue side asymmetry more commonly observed towards jets associated with Class II disks.</description>

Abstract: The green valley represents the population of galaxies that are transitioning from the actively star-forming blue cloud to the passively evolving red sequence. Studying the properties of the green valley galaxies is crucial for our understanding of the exact mechanisms and processes that drive this transition. The green valley does not have a universally accepted definition. The boundaries of the green valley are often determined by empirical lines that are subjective and vary across studies. We present an unambiguous definition of the green valley in the colour-stellar mass plane using the entropic thresholding. We first divide the galaxy population into the blue cloud and the red sequence based on a colour threshold that minimizes the intra-class variance and maximizes the inter-class variance. Our method splits the region between the mean colours of the blue cloud and the red sequence into three parts by maximizing the total entropy of that region. We repeat our analysis in a number of independent stellar mass bins to define the boundaries of the green valley in the colour-mass diagram. Our method provides a robust and natural definition of the green valley.</description>

      <title>Mapping the imprints of stellar and AGN feedback in the circumgalactic medium with X-ray microcalorimeters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Astro2020 Decadal Survey has identified the mapping of the circumgalactic medium (CGM, gaseous plasma around galaxies) as a key objective. We explore the prospects for characterizing the CGM in and around nearby galaxy halos with a future, large grasp X-ray microcalorimeter. We create realistic mock observations from hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba) that demonstrate a wide range of potential measurements, which will address the open questions in galaxy formation and evolution. By including all background and foreground components in our mock observations, we show why it is impossible to perform these measurements with current instruments, such as X-ray CCDs, and only microcalorimeters will allow us to distinguish the faint CGM emission from the bright Milky Way (MW) foreground emission lines. We find that individual halos of MW mass can, on average and depending on star formation rate, be traced out to large radii, around R500, and for larger galaxies even out to R200, using prominent emission lines, such as OVII, or OVIII. Furthermore, we show that emission line ratios for individual halos can reveal the radial temperature structure. Substructure measurements show that it will be possible to relate azimuthal variations to the feedback mode of the galaxy. We demonstrate the ability to construct temperature, velocity, and abundance ratio maps from spectral fitting for individual galaxy halos, which reveal rotation features, AGN outbursts, and enrichment.</description>

      <title>Open superclusters I: The most populated primordial groups of open clusters in the third quadrant of the Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open supercluster (OSC) is defined as a cluster of at least six open clusters (OCs) born from the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). We survey the recent catalogs of OCs based on Gaia data and relevant literature to find 17 OSCs of the third galactic quadrant, along with 190 likely members of them. OSCs are frequent enough to be considered an extra class of objects in the hierarchy of star formation. Some of these supersystems are new and most of them contain more members than previously thought. The detailed study of some OSCs has leaded to the discovery of four new young clusters that are members of them, named Casado-Hendy 2 to 5. In certain instances, subgroups with distinct PMs or 3D positions have been found within an OSC, suggesting the presence of multiple generations of stars formed from several bursts of star formation within the same GMC. OSCs are typically unbound and tend to disintegrate on timescales of 0.1 Gyr. The present results support the Primordial Group hypothesis (Casado 2022) and suggest that globular clusters are not formed from the accretion of open superclusters, at least in the local Universe at late times.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI and NIRCam Unveil Previously Unseen Infrared Stellar Populations in NGC 6822</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 6822 is a nearby (~490 kpc) non-interacting low-metallicity (0.2 Zsolar) dwarf galaxy which hosts several prominent H ii regions, including sites of highly embedded active star formation. In this work, we present an imaging survey of NGC 6822 conducted with the NIRCam and MIRI instruments onboard JWST. We describe the data reduction, source extraction, and stellar population identifications from combined near- and mid-infrared (IR) photometry. Our NIRCam observations reach seven magnitudes deeper than previous JHKs surveys of this galaxy, which were sensitive to just below the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). These JWST observations thus reveal for the first time in the near-IR the red clump stellar population and extend nearly three magnitudes deeper. In the mid-IR, we observe roughly two magnitudes below the TRGB with the MIRI F770W and F1000W filters. With these improvements in sensitivity, we produce a catalogue of ~900,000 point sources over an area of ~ 6.0 x 4.3 arcmin2. We present several NIRCam and MIRI colour-magnitude diagrams and discuss which colour combinations provide useful separations of various stellar populations to aid in future JWST observation planning. Finally, we find populations of carbon- and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars which will assist in improving our understanding of dust production in low-metallicity, early Universe analogue galaxies</description>

      <title>Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): Discovery of a starbursting galaxy group with a radio-luminous core at z=3.95</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of distant galaxy groups and clusters at the peak epoch of star formation is limited by the lack of a statistically and homogeneously selected and spectroscopically confirmed sample. Recent discoveries of concentrated starburst activities in cluster cores have opened a new window to hunt for these structures based on their integrated IR luminosities. Hereby we carry out the large NOEMA (NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array) program targeting a statistical sample of infrared-luminous sources associated with overdensities of massive galaxies at z&gt;2, the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). We present the first result from the ongoing NICE survey, a compact group at z=3.95 in the Lockman Hole field (LH-SBC3), confirmed via four massive (M_star&gt;10^10.5M_sun) galaxies detected in CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) lines. The four CO-detected members of LH-SBC3 are distributed over a 180 kpc physical scale, and the entire structure has an estimated halo mass of ~10^13Msun and total star formation rate (SFR) of ~4000Msun/yr. In addition, the most massive galaxy hosts a radio-loud AGN with L_1.4GHz, rest = 3.0*10^25W/Hz. The discovery of LH-SBC3 demonstrates the feasibility of our method to efficiently identify high-z compact groups or forming cluster cores. The existence of these starbursting cluster cores up to z~4 provides critical insights into the mass assembly history of the central massive galaxies in clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the detection of a magnetized dust ring (M0.8-0.2) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic Center. The results presented in this paper utilize the first data release (DR1) of the Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey (i.e., FIREPLACE I; Butterfield et al. 2023). The FIREPLACE survey is a 214 $\mu$m polarimetic survey of the Galactic Center using the SOFIA/HAWC+ telescope. The M0.8-0.2 ring is a region of gas and dust that has a circular morphology with a central depression. The dust polarization in the M0.8-0.2 ring implies a curved magnetic field that traces the ring-like structure of the cloud. We posit an interpretation in which an expanding shell compresses and concentrates the ambient gas and magnetic field. We argue that this compression results in the strengthening of the magnetic field, as we infer from the observations toward the interior of the ring.</description>

Abstract: We present the second data release (DR2) of the Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey. This survey utilized the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera plus (HAWC+) instrument at 214 $\mu$m (E-band) to observe dust polarization throughout the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way. DR2 consists of observations that were obtained in 2022 covering the region of the CMZ extending roughly from the Brick to the Sgr C molecular clouds (corresponding to a roughly 1$^{\circ}$ $\times$ 0.75$^{\circ}$ region of the sky). We combine DR2 with the first FIREPLACE data release to obtain full coverage of the CMZ (a 1.5$^{\circ}$ $\times$0.75$^{\circ}$ region of the sky). After applying total and polarized intensity significance cuts on the full FIREPLACE data set we obtain $\rm\sim$65,000 Nyquist-sampled polarization pseudovectors. The distribution of polarization pseudovectors confirms a bimodal distribution in the CMZ magnetic field orientations, recovering field components that are oriented predominantly parallel or perpendicular to the Galactic plane. These magnetic field orientations indicate possible connections between the previously observed parallel and perpendicular distributions. We also inspect the magnetic fields toward a set of prominent CMZ molecular clouds (the Brick, Three Little Pigs, 50 km s$\rm^{-1}$, Circum-nuclear Disk, CO 0.02-0.02, 20 km s$\rm^{-1}$, and Sgr C), revealing spatially varying magnetic fields that generally trace the morphologies of the clouds. We find evidence that compression from stellar winds and shear from tidal forces are prominent mechanisms influencing the structure of the magnetic fields observed within the clouds.</description>

      <title>The Hot Circum-Galactic Medium in the eROSITA All Sky Survey I. X-ray Surface Brightness Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a stacking technique to gain enough statistics to detect the hot CGM around galaxies. We use the X-ray data from the first four SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS:4). We discuss how the satellite galaxies could bias the stacking and carefully build the central galaxy samples based on the SDSS spectroscopic survey and halo-based group finder algorithm and isolated galaxy sample from the ninth data release of the DESI Legacy survey (LS DR9, photometric). We mask the detected X-ray point sources and carefully model the X-ray emission from the unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRB) to obtain the X-ray emission from the hot CGM. The X-ray surface brightness profiles are measured for $\log(M_*)&gt;10.0$ or $\log(M_{\rm 200m})&gt;11.5$ central galaxies, and $\log(M_*)&gt;9.5$ isolated galaxies. We detect the X-ray emission around MW-mass ($\log(M_*)=10.5-11.0$) and more massive central galaxies extending up to the virial radius ($R_{\rm vir}$). The signal-to-noise ratio of the extended emission around the MW-mass galaxy is about $8.1\sigma$ within $R_{\rm vir}$. We use the $\beta$ model to describe the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the hot CGM. We obtain a central surface brightness of $S_{\rm X,0}\approx 3.1\times10^{35}\rm erg/s/kpc^2$ and $\beta \approx0.42$ for MW-mass galaxy. We estimate the baryon budget of the hot CGM and obtain a value lower than the $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology predicted. Our results set a firm footing for the presence of a hot CGM around MW-mass and more massive central galaxies. These measurements constitute a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and possible implementations of feedback processes therein.</description>

      <title>The Hot Circum-Galactic Medium in the eROSITA All Sky Survey II. Scaling Relations between X-ray Luminosity and Galaxies' Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the hot circum-galactic medium (CGM) properties relate to the galaxy's properties can constrain galaxy evolution models. We aim to measure the scaling relations between the X-ray luminosity of the hot CGM and the fundamental properties of a galaxy, i.e., its stellar mass and halo mass. We calculate the X-ray luminosity of the hot CGM based on the surface brightness profiles of central galaxy samples measured in Zhang et al. (2024a, submitted) from Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA all-sky survey data. We relate the X-ray luminosity to the galaxies' stellar and halo mass. We compare the observed relations to the TNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations. The hot CGM X-ray luminosity correlates with the galaxy's stellar mass ($M_*$). It increases from $2.1 \pm 1.3\times10^{39} \rm erg/s$ to $2.0 \pm 0.1\times10^{41} \rm erg/s$, when $\log(M_*)$ increases from 10.0 to 11.5. A double power law describes the correlation, with a break at $\log(M_*)=11.28\pm 0.03$ and a power-law index or $1.9\pm 0.2$ ($4.2\pm0.1$) below (above) the break. The hot CGM X-ray luminosity as a function of halo mass is measured within $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=11.3-13.7$, extending our knowledge of the scaling relation by more than two orders of magnitude. $L_{\rm X,CGM}$ increases with $M_{\rm 500c}$ from $2.7 \pm 0.9\times10^{39}\ \rm erg/s$ at $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=11.3$ to $9.2 \pm 0.4\times10^{41}\ \rm erg/s$ at $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=13.7$. The relation follows a power law of $\log(L_{\rm X,CGM})= (1.35\pm 0.04)\times \log(M_{\rm 500c})+(23.8\pm0.5)$. We find a general agreement between simulations and observation. We explore, at the low mass end, the average scaling relations between the CGM X-ray luminosity and the galaxy's stellar mass or halo mass, which constitutes a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and feedback processes.</description>

      <title>Brightest Cluster Galaxy Offsets in Cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of offsets between the brightest cluster galaxies of galaxy clusters and the centroid of their dark matter distributions is a promising probe of the underlying dark matter physics. In particular, since this distribution is sensitive to the shape of the potential in galaxy cluster cores, it constitutes a test of dark matter self-interaction on the largest mass scales in the universe. We examine these offsets in three suites of modern cosmological simulations; IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG and BAHAMAS. For clusters above $10^{14}\rm{M_\odot}$, we examine the dependence of the offset distribution on gravitational softening length, the method used to identify centroids, redshift, mass, baryonic physics, and establish the stability of our results with respect to various nuisance parameter choices. We find that offsets are overwhelmingly measured to be smaller than the minimum converged length scale in each simulation, with a median offset of $\sim 1\rm{kpc}$ in the highest resolution simulation considered, TNG300-1, which uses a gravitational softening length of $1.48\rm{kpc}$. We also find that centroids identified via source extraction on smoothed dark matter and stellar particle data are consistent with the potential minimum, but that observationally relevant methods sensitive to cluster strong gravitational lensing scales, or those using the the "light traces mass" approach, in this context meaning gas is used as a tracer for the potential, can overestimate offsets by factors of $\sim10$ and $\sim30$, respectively. This has the potential to reduce tensions with existing offset measurements which have served as evidence for a nonzero dark matter self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>Ultra-deep imaging of NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4 to unravel their origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of scenarios have been proposed to explain the low velocity dispersion (and hence possible absence of dark matter) of the low surface brightness galaxies NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4. Most of the proposed mechanisms are based on the removal of dark matter via the interaction of these galaxies with other objects. A common feature of these processes is the prediction of very faint tidal tails, which should be revealed by deep imaging (mu_g &gt; 30 mag/arcsec2). Using ultra-deep images obtained with the Gemini telescopes, about 1 mag deeper than previously published data, we analyzed the possible presence of tidal tails in both galaxies. We confirm the presence of tidal tails in NGC1052-DF4, but see no evidence for tidal effects in NGC1052-DF2, down to surface brightnesses of mu_g=30.9 mag/arcsec2. We therefore conclude that while the absence of dark matter in NGC1052-DF4 could be attributed to the removal of dark matter by gravitational interactions, in the case of NGC1052-DF2 this explanation seems less plausible, and therefore other possibilities such as an incorrect distance measurement or that the system may be rotating could alleviate the dark matter problem.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Ghostly Remains of an Extremely Diffuse Satellite in the Remote Halo of NGC 253</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of NGC253-SNFC-dw1, a new satellite galaxy in the remote stellar halo of the Sculptor Group spiral, NGC 253. The system was revealed using deep resolved star photometry obtained as part of the Subaru Near-Field Cosmology Survey that uses the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. Although rather luminous ($\rm{M_{V}} = -11.7 \pm 0.2$) and massive ($M_* \sim 1.25\times 10^7~\rm{M}_{\odot}$), the system is one of the most diffuse satellites yet known, with a half-light radius of $\rm{R_{h}} = 3.37 \pm 0.36$ kpc and an average surface brightness of $\sim 30.1$ mag arcmin$^{-2}$ within the $\rm{R_{h}}$. The colour-magnitude diagram shows a dominant old ($\sim 10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($\rm{[M/H]}=-1.5 \pm 0.1$ dex) stellar population, as well as several candidate thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars. The distribution of red giant branch stars is asymmetrical and displays two elongated tidal extensions pointing towards NGC 253, suggestive of a highly disrupted system being observed at apocenter. NGC253-SNFC-dw1 has a size comparable to that of the puzzling Local Group dwarfs Andromeda XIX and Antlia 2 but is two magnitudes brighter. While unambiguous evidence of tidal disruption in these systems has not yet been demonstrated, the morphology of NGC253-SNFC-dw1 clearly shows that this is a natural path to produce such diffuse and extended galaxies. The surprising discovery of this system in a previously well-searched region of the sky emphasizes the importance of surface brightness limiting depth in satellite searches.</description>

      <title>Confusion of extragalactic sources in the far infrared: a baseline assessment of the performance of PRIMAger in intensity and polarization</title>

Abstract: Because of their limited angular resolution, far-infrared telescopes are usually affected by confusion phenomenon. Since several galaxies can be located in the same instrumental beam, only the brightest objects emerge from the fluctuations caused by fainter sources. The probe far-infrared mission for astrophysics imager (PRIMAger) will observe the mid- and far-infrared (25-235 $\mu$m) sky both in intensity and polarization. We aim to provide predictions of the confusion level and its consequences for future surveys. We produced simulated PRIMAger maps affected only by the confusion noise using the simulated infrared extragalactic sky (SIDES) semi-empirical simulation. We then estimated the confusion limit in these maps and extracted the sources using a basic blind extractor. By comparing the input galaxy catalog and the extracted source catalog, we derived various performance metrics as completeness, purity, and the accuracy of various measurements. In intensity, we predict that the confusion limit increases rapidly with increasing wavelength. The confusion limit in polarization is more than 100x lower. The measured flux density is dominated by the brightest galaxy in the beam, but other objects also contribute at longer wavelength (~30% at 235 $\mu$m). We also show that galaxy clustering has a mild impact on confusion in intensity (up to 25%), while it is negligible in polarization. In intensity, a basic blind extraction will be sufficient to detect galaxies at the knee of the luminosity function up to z~3 and 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ main-sequence galaxies up to z~5. In polarization for a conservative sensitivity, we expect ~8 000 detections up to z=2.5 opening a totally new window on the high-z dust polarization. Finally, we show that intensity surveys at short wavelength and polarization surveys at long wavelength tend to reach confusion at similar depth. There is thus a strong synergy.</description>

      <title>Stacking X-ray Observations of "Little Red Dots": Implications for their AGN Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent {\em James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)} observations have revealed a population of compact extragalactic objects at $z\gtrsim4$ with red near-infrared colors, which have been dubbed as ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). The spectroscopically-selected LRDs exhibit broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, which has led to the conclusion that type-I active galactic nuclei (AGN) are harbored in the galaxies' dust-reddened cores. However, other mechanisms, like strong outflowing winds, could also produce broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, and thus, the nature of LRDs is still under debate. In this work, we test the AGN hypothesis for LRDs by stacking the archival {\em Chandra} observations of 19 spectroscopically-selected LRDs. We obtain non-detections in both the soft $(0.5-2\text{ keV})$ and the hard $(2-8\text{ keV})$ X-ray band after stacking, and put upper limits on the X-ray luminosities of these LRDs. We find that the soft band upper limit is $\sim1$ dex lower than the expected level from the $L_\text{X}-L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ relation, while the hard band upper limit is consistent with this relation. This result suggests that LRDs and typical type-I AGNs have significantly different properties. We consider it unlikely that absorption is the main reason for the observed low $L_\text{X}/L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ ratios of LRDs. Alternatively, we discuss two plausible hypotheses: (1) LRDs have intrinsically weak X-ray emissions, (2) fast, galactic-scale outflows have a major contribution to the observed broad H$\alpha$ lines. Our findings indicate that empirical relations (e.g., for black hole mass measurements) established for typical type-I AGNs should be used with caution when analyzing the properties of LRDs.</description>

      <title>Large-scale motions and growth rate from forward-modelling Tully-Fisher peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peculiar velocities are an important probe of the mass distribution in the Universe and the growth rate of structure, directly measuring the effects of gravity on the largest scales and providing a test for theories of gravity. Comparing peculiar velocities predicted from the density field mapped by a galaxy redshift survey with peculiar velocities measured using a distance estimator such as the Tully-Fisher relation yields the growth factor for large-scale structure. We present a method for forward-modelling a sample of galaxy magnitudes and velocity widths that simultaneously determines the parameters of the Tully-Fisher relation and the peculiar velocity field. We apply this to the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) Tully-Fisher dataset, using the peculiar velocities predicted from the 2M++ redshift survey. After validating the method on mock surveys, we measure the product of the growth rate and mass fluctuation amplitude to be $f\!\sigma_8$ = 0.35$\pm$0.03 at an effective redshift of $z$ = 0.017. This is consistent at 3$\sigma$ with the Planck CMB prediction, even though the uncertainty does not fully account for all sources of sample variance. We find the residual bulk flow from gravitational influences outside the 2M++ survey volume to be $|V|$ = 227$\pm$11 km/s, $(l,b)$ = (303$^\circ$,$-$1$^\circ$) in Galactic polar coordinates and the CMB frame. Using simulations, we show that applying our methodology to the large new sample of Tully-Fisher peculiar velocities expected from the WALLABY HI survey of the southern sky can improve the constraints on the growth rate by a factor of 2-3.</description>

      <title>A quantitative comparison between velocity dependent SIDM cross sections constrained by the gravothermal and isothermal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One necessary step for probing the nature of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) particles with astrophysical observations is to pin down any possible velocity dependence in the SIDM cross section. Major challenges for achieving this goal include eliminating, or mitigating, the impact of the baryonic components and tidal effects within the dark matter halos of interest -- the effects of these processes can be highly degenerate with those of dark matter self-interactions at small scales. In this work we select 9 isolated galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with baryonic components small enough such that the baryonic gravitational potentials do not significantly influence the halo gravothermal evolution processes. We then constrain the parameters of Rutherford and Moller scattering cross section models with the measured rotation curves and stellar kinematics through the gravothermal fluid formalism and isothermal method. Cross sections constrained by the two methods are consistent at $1\sigma$ confidence level, but the isothermal method prefers cross sections greater than the gravothermal approach constraints by a factor of $\sim3$.</description>

      <title>Tidal Spin-up of Black Hole Progenitor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations indicate the existence of merging black holes (BHs) with high spin ($a\gtrsim0.3$), whose formation pathways are still an open question. A possible way to form those binaries is through the tidal spin-up of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star by its BH companion. In this work, we investigate this scenario by directly calculating the tidal excitation of oscillation modes in WR star models, determining the tidal spin-up rate, and integrating the coupled spin-orbit evolution for WR-BH binaries. We find that for short-period orbits and massive WR stars, the tidal interaction is mostly contributed by standing gravity modes, in contrast to Zahn's model of travelling waves which is frequently assumed in the literature. The standing modes are less efficiently damped than traveling waves, meaning that prior estimates of tidal spin-up may be overestimated. We show that tidal synchronization is rarely reached in WR-BH binaries, and the resulting BH spins have $a \lesssim 0.4$ for all but the shortest period ($P_{\rm orb} \! \lesssim 0.5 \, {\rm d}$) binaries. Tidal spin-up in lower-mass systems is more efficient, providing an anti-correlation between the mass and spin of the BHs, which could be tested in future gravitational wave data. Nonlinear damping processes are poorly understood but may allow for more efficient tidal spin-up. We also discuss a new class of gravito-thermal modes that appear in our calculations.</description>

Abstract: Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) form a mysterious class of variable stars with typical periods of tens of minutes and amplitudes above 0.1 mag. In this work, we present results of a variability search focused on timescales shorter than 1 h, conducted in OGLE-IV Galactic disk fields containing about 1.1 billion stellar sources down to I$\approx$20 mag. Twenty-five BLAPs have been detected, 20 of which are new discoveries. Their periods range from 8.4 min to 62.1 min. We have also found six new eclipsing binary systems with orbital periods from 38.3 min to 121.3 min and five short-period large-amplitude (&gt; 0.17 mag in the I-band) variable stars of unknown type.</description>

      <title>Scalable hierarchical BayeSN inference: Investigating dependence of SN Ia host galaxy dust properties on stellar mass and redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the hierarchical probabilistic SED model BayeSN to analyse a sample of 475 SNe Ia (0.015 &lt; z &lt; 0.4) from Foundation, DES3YR and PS1MD to investigate the properties of dust in their host galaxies. We jointly infer the dust law $R_V$ population distributions at the SED level in high- and low-mass galaxies simultaneously with dust-independent, intrinsic differences. We find an intrinsic mass step of $-0.049\pm0.016$ mag, at a significance of 3.1$\sigma$, when allowing for a constant intrinsic, achromatic magnitude offset. We additionally apply a model allowing for time- and wavelength-dependent intrinsic differences between SNe Ia in different mass bins, finding $\sim$2$\sigma$ differences in magnitude and colour around peak and 4.5$\sigma$ differences at later times. These intrinsic differences are inferred simultaneously with a difference in population mean $R_V$ of $\sim$2$\sigma$ significance, demonstrating that both intrinsic and extrinsic differences may play a role in causing the host galaxy mass step. We also consider a model which allows the mean of the $R_V$ distribution to linearly evolve with redshift but find no evidence for any evolution - we infer the gradient of this relation $\eta_R = -0.38\pm0.70$. In addition, we discuss in brief a new, GPU-accelerated Python implementation of BayeSN suitable for application to large surveys which is publicly available and can be used for future cosmological analyses; this code can be found here: https://github.com/bayesn/bayesn.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a hot post-AGB star in Galactic globular cluster E3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a new hot post-asymptotic giant branch (PAGB) star in the Galactic globular cluster (GC) E3, which is one of the first of the identified PAGB stars in a GC to show a binary signature. The star stands out as the brightest source in E3 in the \mbox{{\em Astrosat}}/UVIT images. We confirmed its membership with the cluster E3 using Gaia DR3 kinematics and parallax measurements. We supplemented the photometric observations with radial velocities (RVs) from high-resolution spectroscopic observations at two epochs and with ground- and space-based photometric observations from 0.13 $\mu$m to 22 $\mu$m. We find that the RVs vary over $\sim$6 \kms\ between the two epochs. This is an indication of the star being in a binary orbit. A simulation of possible binary systems with the observed RVs suggests a binary period of either 39.12 days or 17.83 days with mass ratio q$\geq$1.0. The [Fe/H] derived using the high-resolution spectra is $\sim -$0.7 dex, which closely matches the cluster metallicity. The spectroscopic and photometric measurements suggest \Teff\ and $\log g$ of the star as 17\,500$\pm$1\,000~K and 2.37$\pm$0.20~dex, respectively. Various PAGB evolutionary tracks on the Hertzsprung--Russell (H-R) diagram suggest a current mass of the star in the range 0.51$-$0.55 \Msun. The star is enriched with C and O abundances, showing similar CNO abundances compared to the other PAGB stars in GCs with the evidence of the third dredge-up on the AGB phase.</description>
