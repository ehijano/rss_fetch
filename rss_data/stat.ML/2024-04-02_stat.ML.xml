      <title>Convergence Guarantees for RMSProp and Adam in Generalized-smooth Non-convex Optimization with Affine Noise Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first tight convergence analyses for RMSProp and Adam in non-convex optimization under the most relaxed assumptions of coordinate-wise generalized smoothness and affine noise variance. We first analyze RMSProp, which is a special case of Adam with adaptive learning rates but without first-order momentum. Specifically, to solve the challenges due to dependence among adaptive update, unbounded gradient estimate and Lipschitz constant, we demonstrate that the first-order term in the descent lemma converges and its denominator is upper bounded by a function of gradient norm. Based on this result, we show that RMSProp with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-4})$. We then generalize our analysis to Adam, where the additional challenge is due to a mismatch between the gradient and first-order momentum. We develop a new upper bound on the first-order term in the descent lemma, which is also a function of the gradient norm. We show that Adam with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our complexity results for both RMSProp and Adam match with the complexity lower bound established in \cite{arjevani2023lower}.</description>

      <title>Fair MP-BOOST: Fair and Interpretable Minipatch Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble methods, particularly boosting, have established themselves as highly effective and widely embraced machine learning techniques for tabular data. In this paper, we aim to leverage the robust predictive power of traditional boosting methods while enhancing fairness and interpretability. To achieve this, we develop Fair MP-Boost, a stochastic boosting scheme that balances fairness and accuracy by adaptively learning features and observations during training. Specifically, Fair MP-Boost sequentially samples small subsets of observations and features, termed minipatches (MP), according to adaptively learned feature and observation sampling probabilities. We devise these probabilities by combining loss functions, or by combining feature importance scores to address accuracy and fairness simultaneously. Hence, Fair MP-Boost prioritizes important and fair features along with challenging instances, to select the most relevant minipatches for learning. The learned probability distributions also yield intrinsic interpretations of feature importance and important observations in Fair MP-Boost. Through empirical evaluation of simulated and benchmark datasets, we showcase the interpretability, accuracy, and fairness of Fair MP-Boost.</description>

      <title>FAIRM: Learning invariant representations for algorithmic fairness and domain generalization with minimax optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods often assume that the test data have the same distribution as the training data. However, this assumption may not hold due to multiple levels of heterogeneity in applications, raising issues in algorithmic fairness and domain generalization. In this work, we address the problem of fair and generalizable machine learning by invariant principles. We propose a training environment-based oracle, FAIRM, which has desirable fairness and domain generalization properties under a diversity-type condition. We then provide an empirical FAIRM with finite-sample theoretical guarantees under weak distributional assumptions. We then develop efficient algorithms to realize FAIRM in linear models and demonstrate the nonasymptotic performance with minimax optimality. We evaluate our method in numerical experiments with synthetic data and MNIST data and show that it outperforms its counterparts.</description>

      <title>Preventing Model Collapse in Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVMs) are a versatile family of unsupervised learning models, commonly used for dimensionality reduction. However, common challenges in modeling data with GPLVMs include inadequate kernel flexibility and improper selection of the projection noise, which leads to a type of model collapse characterized primarily by vague latent representations that do not reflect the underlying structure of the data. This paper addresses these issues by, first, theoretically examining the impact of the projection variance on model collapse through the lens of a linear GPLVM. Second, we address the problem of model collapse due to inadequate kernel flexibility by integrating the spectral mixture (SM) kernel and a differentiable random Fourier feature (RFF) kernel approximation, which ensures computational scalability and efficiency through off-the-shelf automatic differentiation tools for learning the kernel hyperparameters, projection variance, and latent representations within the variational inference framework. The proposed GPLVM, named advisedRFLVM, is evaluated across diverse datasets and consistently outperforms various salient competing models, including state-of-the-art variational autoencoders (VAEs) and GPLVM variants, in terms of informative latent representations and missing data imputation.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Robust Off-Policy Evaluation with Estimated Logging Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel doubly-robust (DR) off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimator for Markov decision processes, DRUnknown, designed for situations where both the logging policy and the value function are unknown. The proposed estimator initially estimates the logging policy and then estimates the value function model by minimizing the asymptotic variance of the estimator while considering the estimating effect of the logging policy. When the logging policy model is correctly specified, DRUnknown achieves the smallest asymptotic variance within the class containing existing OPE estimators. When the value function model is also correctly specified, DRUnknown is optimal as its asymptotic variance reaches the semiparametric lower bound. We present experimental results conducted in contextual bandits and reinforcement learning to compare the performance of DRUnknown with that of existing methods.</description>

      <title>When does Subagging Work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of subagging, or subsample aggregating, on regression trees, a popular non-parametric method in machine learning. First, we give sufficient conditions for pointwise consistency of trees. We formalize that (i) the bias depends on the diameter of cells, hence trees with few splits tend to be biased, and (ii) the variance depends on the number of observations in cells, hence trees with many splits tend to have large variance. While these statements for bias and variance are known to hold globally in the covariate space, we show that, under some constraints, they are also true locally. Second, we compare the performance of subagging to that of trees across different numbers of splits. We find that (1) for any given number of splits, subagging improves upon a single tree, and (2) this improvement is larger for many splits than it is for few splits. However, (3) a single tree grown at optimal size can outperform subagging if the size of its individual trees is not optimally chosen. This last result goes against common practice of growing large randomized trees to eliminate bias and then averaging to reduce variance.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Combinatorial Bandits with Switching Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of adversarial combinatorial bandit with a switching cost $\lambda$ for a switch of each selected arm in each round, considering both the bandit feedback and semi-bandit feedback settings. In the oblivious adversarial case with $K$ base arms and time horizon $T$, we derive lower bounds for the minimax regret and design algorithms to approach them. To prove these lower bounds, we design stochastic loss sequences for both feedback settings, building on an idea from previous work in Dekel et al. (2014). The lower bound for bandit feedback is $ \tilde{\Omega}\big( (\lambda K)^{\frac{1}{3}} (TI)^{\frac{2}{3}}\big)$ while that for semi-bandit feedback is $ \tilde{\Omega}\big( (\lambda K I)^{\frac{1}{3}} T^{\frac{2}{3}}\big)$ where $I$ is the number of base arms in the combinatorial arm played in each round. To approach these lower bounds, we design algorithms that operate in batches by dividing the time horizon into batches to restrict the number of switches between actions. For the bandit feedback setting, where only the total loss of the combinatorial arm is observed, we introduce the Batched-Exp2 algorithm which achieves a regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}\big((\lambda K)^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}}I^{\frac{4}{3}}\big)$ as $T$ tends to infinity. In the semi-bandit feedback setting, where all losses for the combinatorial arm are observed, we propose the Batched-BROAD algorithm which achieves a regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}\big( (\lambda K)^{\frac{1}{3}} (TI)^{\frac{2}{3}}\big)$.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve Job Shop Scheduling under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem where tasks need to be scheduled on machines in order to minimize criteria such as makespan or delay. To address more realistic scenarios, we associate a probability distribution with the duration of each task. Our objective is to generate a robust schedule, i.e. that minimizes the average makespan. This paper introduces a new approach that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to search for robust solutions, emphasizing JSSPs with uncertain durations. Key contributions of this research include: (1) advancements in DRL applications to JSSPs, enhancing generalization and scalability, (2) a novel method for addressing JSSPs with uncertain durations. The Wheatley approach, which integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and DRL, is made publicly available for further research and applications.</description>

      <title>Is Model Collapse Inevitable? Breaking the Curse of Recursion by Accumulating Real and Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of generative models, combined with pretraining on web-scale data, raises a timely question: what happens when these models are trained on their own generated outputs? Recent investigations into model-data feedback loops discovered that such loops can lead to model collapse, a phenomenon where performance progressively degrades with each model-fitting iteration until the latest model becomes useless. However, several recent papers studying model collapse assumed that new data replace old data over time rather than assuming data accumulate over time. In this paper, we compare these two settings and show that accumulating data prevents model collapse. We begin by studying an analytically tractable setup in which a sequence of linear models are fit to the previous models' predictions. Previous work showed if data are replaced, the test error increases linearly with the number of model-fitting iterations; we extend this result by proving that if data instead accumulate, the test error has a finite upper bound independent of the number of iterations. We next empirically test whether accumulating data similarly prevents model collapse by pretraining sequences of language models on text corpora. We confirm that replacing data does indeed cause model collapse, then demonstrate that accumulating data prevents model collapse; these results hold across a range of model sizes, architectures and hyperparameters. We further show that similar results hold for other deep generative models on real data: diffusion models for molecule generation and variational autoencoders for image generation. Our work provides consistent theoretical and empirical evidence that data accumulation mitigates model collapse.</description>

      <title>Can Biases in ImageNet Models Explain Generalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robust generalization of models to rare, in-distribution (ID) samples drawn from the long tail of the training distribution and to out-of-training-distribution (OOD) samples is one of the major challenges of current deep learning methods. For image classification, this manifests in the existence of adversarial attacks, the performance drops on distorted images, and a lack of generalization to concepts such as sketches. The current understanding of generalization in neural networks is very limited, but some biases that differentiate models from human vision have been identified and might be causing these limitations. Consequently, several attempts with varying success have been made to reduce these biases during training to improve generalization. We take a step back and sanity-check these attempts. Fixing the architecture to the well-established ResNet-50, we perform a large-scale study on 48 ImageNet models obtained via different training methods to understand how and if these biases - including shape bias, spectral biases, and critical bands - interact with generalization. Our extensive study results reveal that contrary to previous findings, these biases are insufficient to accurately predict the generalization of a model holistically. We provide access to all checkpoints and evaluation code at https://github.com/paulgavrikov/biases_vs_generalization</description>

      <title>Propensity Score Alignment of Unpaired Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning techniques typically rely on paired samples to learn common representations, but paired samples are challenging to collect in fields such as biology where measurement devices often destroy the samples. This paper presents an approach to address the challenge of aligning unpaired samples across disparate modalities in multimodal representation learning. We draw an analogy between potential outcomes in causal inference and potential views in multimodal observations, which allows us to use Rubin's framework to estimate a common space in which to match samples. Our approach assumes we collect samples that are experimentally perturbed by treatments, and uses this to estimate a propensity score from each modality, which encapsulates all shared information between a latent state and treatment and can be used to define a distance between samples. We experiment with two alignment techniques that leverage this distance -- shared nearest neighbours (SNN) and optimal transport (OT) matching -- and find that OT matching results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art alignment approaches in both a synthetic multi-modal setting and in real-world data from NeurIPS Multimodal Single-Cell Integration Challenge.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ denote a generative language model. Let $r$ denote a reward model that returns a scalar that captures the degree at which a draw from $p$ is preferred. The goal of language model alignment is to alter $p$ to a new distribution $\phi$ that results in a higher expected reward while keeping $\phi$ close to $p.$ A popular alignment method is the KL-constrained reinforcement learning (RL), which chooses a distribution $\phi_\Delta$ that maximizes $E_{\phi_{\Delta}} r(y)$ subject to a relative entropy constraint $KL(\phi_\Delta || p) \leq \Delta.$ Another simple alignment method is best-of-$N$, where $N$ samples are drawn from $p$ and one with highest reward is selected. In this paper, we offer a closed-form characterization of the optimal KL-constrained RL solution. We demonstrate that any alignment method that achieves a comparable trade-off between KL divergence and reward must approximate the optimal KL-constrained RL solution in terms of relative entropy. To further analyze the properties of alignment methods, we introduce two simplifying assumptions: we let the language model be memoryless, and the reward model be linear. Although these assumptions may not reflect complex real-world scenarios, they enable a precise characterization of the asymptotic behavior of both the best-of-$N$ alignment, and the KL-constrained RL method, in terms of information-theoretic quantities. We prove that the reward of the optimal KL-constrained RL solution satisfies a large deviation principle, and we fully characterize its rate function. We also show that the rate of growth of the scaled cumulants of the reward is characterized by a proper Renyi cross entropy. Finally, we show that best-of-$N$ is asymptotically equivalent to KL-constrained RL solution by proving that their expected rewards are asymptotically equal, and concluding that the two distributions must be close in KL divergence.</description>

      <title>Supervised Autoencoder MLP for Financial Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of financial time series forecasting with the use of neural networks through supervised autoencoders, aiming to improve investment strategy performance. It specifically examines the impact of noise augmentation and triple barrier labeling on risk-adjusted returns, using the Sharpe and Information Ratios. The study focuses on the S&amp;P 500 index, EUR/USD, and BTC/USD as the traded assets from January 1, 2010, to April 30, 2022. Findings indicate that supervised autoencoders, with balanced noise augmentation and bottleneck size, significantly boost strategy effectiveness. However, excessive noise and large bottleneck sizes can impair performance, highlighting the importance of precise parameter tuning. This paper also presents a derivation of a novel optimization metric that can be used with triple barrier labeling. The results of this study have substantial policy implications, suggesting that financial institutions and regulators could leverage techniques presented to enhance market stability and investor protection, while also encouraging more informed and strategic investment approaches in various financial sectors.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Combinatorial Maximization: Beyond Approximate Greedy Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study adaptive combinatorial maximization, which is a core challenge in machine learning, with applications in active learning as well as many other domains. We study the Bayesian setting, and consider the objectives of maximization under a cardinality constraint and minimum cost coverage. We provide new comprehensive approximation guarantees that subsume previous results, as well as considerably strengthen them. Our approximation guarantees simultaneously support the maximal gain ratio as well as near-submodular utility functions, and include both maximization under a cardinality constraint and a minimum cost coverage guarantee. In addition, we provided an approximation guarantee for a modified prior, which is crucial for obtaining active learning guarantees that do not depend on the smallest probability in the prior. Moreover, we discover a new parameter of adaptive selection policies, which we term the "maximal gain ratio". We show that this parameter is strictly less restrictive than the greedy approximation parameter that has been used in previous approximation guarantees, and show that it can be used to provide stronger approximation guarantees than previous results. In particular, we show that the maximal gain ratio is never larger than the greedy approximation factor of a policy, and that it can be considerably smaller. This provides a new insight into the properties that make a policy useful for adaptive combinatorial maximization.</description>

      <title>Robustly estimating heterogeneity in factorial data using Rashomon Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many statistical analyses, in both observational data and randomized control trials, ask: how does the outcome of interest vary with combinations of observable covariates? How do various drug combinations affect health outcomes, or how does technology adoption depend on incentives and demographics? Our goal is to partition this factorial space into ``pools'' of covariate combinations where the outcome differs across the pools (but not within a pool). Existing approaches (i) search for a single ``optimal'' partition under assumptions about the association between covariates or (ii) sample from the entire set of possible partitions. Both these approaches ignore the reality that, especially with correlation structure in covariates, many ways to partition the covariate space may be statistically indistinguishable, despite very different implications for policy or science. We develop an alternative perspective, called Rashomon Partition Sets (RPSs). Each item in the RPS partitions the space of covariates using a tree-like geometry. RPSs incorporate all partitions that have posterior values near the maximum a posteriori partition, even if they offer substantively different explanations, and do so using a prior that makes no assumptions about associations between covariates. This prior is the $\ell_0$ prior, which we show is minimax optimal. Given the RPS we calculate the posterior of any measurable function of the feature effects vector on outcomes, conditional on being in the RPS. We also characterize approximation error relative to the entire posterior and provide bounds on the size of the RPS. Simulations demonstrate this framework allows for robust conclusions relative to conventional regularization techniques. We apply our method to three empirical settings: price effects on charitable giving, chromosomal structure (telomere length), and the introduction of microfinance.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize the target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve nearly 100\% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on GPT-3.5/4, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Gemma-7B, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with 100\% success rate. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). We provide the code, prompts, and logs of the attacks at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.</description>

      <title>CP-PINNs: Data-Driven Changepoints Detection in PDEs Using Online Optimized Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in scenarios where the parameters of the given PDE dynamics may exhibit changepoints at random time. We employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) - universal approximators capable of estimating the solution of any physical law described by a system of PDEs, which serves as a regularization during neural network training, restricting the space of admissible solutions and enhancing function approximation accuracy. We demonstrate that when the system exhibits sudden changes in the PDE dynamics, this regularization is either insufficient to accurately estimate the true dynamics, or it may result in model miscalibration and failure. Consequently, we propose a PINNs extension using a Total-Variation penalty, which allows to accommodate multiple changepoints in the PDE dynamics and significantly improves function approximation. These changepoints can occur at random locations over time and are estimated concurrently with the solutions. Additionally, we introduce an online learning method for re-weighting loss function terms dynamically. Through empirical analysis using examples of various equations with parameter changes, we showcase the advantages of our proposed model. In the absence of changepoints, the model reverts to the original PINNs model. However, when changepoints are present, our approach yields superior parameter estimation, improved model fitting, and reduced training error compared to the original PINNs model.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian inference provides a methodology for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification in machine learning and deep learning methods. Variational inference and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods are used to implement Bayesian inference. In the past three decades, MCMC sampling methods have faced some challenges in being adapted to larger models (such as in deep learning) and big data problems. Advanced proposal distributions that incorporate gradients, such as a Langevin proposal distribution, provide a means to address some of the limitations of MCMC sampling for Bayesian neural networks. Furthermore, MCMC methods have typically been constrained to statisticians and currently not well-known among deep learning researchers. We present a tutorial for MCMC methods that covers simple Bayesian linear and logistic models, and Bayesian neural networks. The aim of this tutorial is to bridge the gap between theory and implementation via coding, given a general sparsity of libraries and tutorials to this end. This tutorial provides code in Python with data and instructions that enable their use and extension. We provide results for some benchmark problems showing the strengths and weaknesses of implementing the respective Bayesian models via MCMC. We highlight the challenges in sampling multi-modal posterior distributions for the case of Bayesian neural networks and the need for further improvement of convergence diagnosis methods.</description>

      <title>Samplet basis pursuit: Multiresolution scattered data approximation with sparsity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider scattered data approximation in samplet coordinates with $\ell_1$-regularization. The application of an $\ell_1$-regularization term enforces sparsity of the coefficients with respect to the samplet basis. Samplets are wavelet-type signed measures, which are tailored to scattered data. Therefore, samplets enable the use of well-established multiresolution techniques on general scattered data sets. They provide similar properties as wavelets in terms of localization, multiresolution analysis, and data compression. By using the Riesz isometry, we embed samplets into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the properties of the resulting functions. We argue that the class of signals that are sparse with respect to the embedded samplet basis is considerably larger than the class of signals that are sparse with respect to the basis of kernel translates. Vice versa, every signal that is a linear combination of only a few kernel translates is sparse in samplet coordinates.
  We propose the rapid solution of the problem under consideration by combining soft-shrinkage with the semi-smooth Newton method. Leveraging on the sparse representation of kernel matrices in samplet coordinates, this approach converges faster than the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and is feasible for large-scale data. Numerical benchmarks are presented and demonstrate the superiority of the multiresolution approach over the single-scale approach. As large-scale applications, the surface reconstruction from scattered data and the reconstruction of scattered temperature data using a dictionary of multiple kernels are considered.</description>

      <title>VC dimension of Graph Neural Networks with Pfaffian activation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged in recent years as a powerful tool to learn tasks across a wide range of graph domains in a data-driven fashion; based on a message passing mechanism, GNNs have gained increasing popularity due to their intuitive formulation, closely linked with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism, to which they have proven equivalent. From a theoretical point of view, GNNs have been shown to be universal approximators, and their generalization capability (namely, bounds on the Vapnik Chervonekis (VC) dimension) has recently been investigated for GNNs with piecewise polynomial activation functions. The aim of our work is to extend this analysis on the VC dimension of GNNs to other commonly used activation functions, such as sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, using the framework of Pfaffian function theory. Bounds are provided with respect to architecture parameters (depth, number of neurons, input size) as well as with respect to the number of colors resulting from the 1-WL test applied on the graph domain. The theoretical analysis is supported by a preliminary experimental study.</description>

      <title>Pathspace Kalman Filters with Dynamic Process Uncertainty for Analyzing Time-course Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kalman Filter (KF) is an optimal linear state prediction algorithm, with applications in fields as diverse as engineering, economics, robotics, and space exploration. Here, we develop an extension of the KF, called a Pathspace Kalman Filter (PKF) which allows us to a) dynamically track the uncertainties associated with the underlying data and prior knowledge, and b) take as input an entire trajectory and an underlying mechanistic model, and using a Bayesian methodology quantify the different sources of uncertainty. An application of this algorithm is to automatically detect temporal windows where the internal mechanistic model deviates from the data in a time-dependent manner. First, we provide theorems characterizing the convergence of the PKF algorithm. Then, we numerically demonstrate that the PKF outperforms conventional KF methods on a synthetic dataset lowering the mean-squared-error by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we apply this method to biological time-course dataset involving over 1.8 million gene expression measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for learning memory kernels in Generalized Langevin Equations. This approach initially utilizes a regularized Prony method to estimate correlation functions from trajectory data, followed by regression over a Sobolev norm-based loss function with RKHS regularization. Our method guarantees improved performance within an exponentially weighted L^2 space, with the kernel estimation error controlled by the error in estimated correlation functions. We demonstrate the superiority of our estimator compared to other regression estimators that rely on L^2 loss functions and also an estimator derived from the inverse Laplace transform, using numerical examples that highlight its consistent advantage across various weight parameter selections. Additionally, we provide examples that include the application of force and drift terms in the equation.</description>

Abstract: In cancer research there is much interest in building and validating outcome predicting outcomes to support treatment decisions. However, because most outcome prediction models are developed and validated without regard to the causal aspects of treatment decision making, many published outcome prediction models may cause harm when used for decision making, despite being found accurate in validation studies. Guidelines on prediction model validation and the checklist for risk model endorsement by the American Joint Committee on Cancer do not protect against prediction models that are accurate during development and validation but harmful when used for decision making. We explain why this is the case and how to build and validate models that are useful for decision making.</description>

      <title>Learning The Likelihood Test With One-Class Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an observation randomly generated from two alternative probability density functions (pdfs) P0 and P1, we consider the problem of deciding which pdf generated the observation. To design the decision technique we assume that we either know P0 or have a set of samples generated from it; the P1 pdf is instead completely unknown. Such a scenario arises, for example, in security contexts, where the attacker's behavior is completely unknown to the legitimate users. When the P0 pdf is known, we resort to the likelihood test (LT), while when a set of samples with its distribution is available, we resort to one-class classification (OCC). We focus on the problem of learning OCC models that operate as the LT. We show this occurs for the multilayer perceptron neural network (NN) and the one-class least-squares support vector machine (OCLSSVM) models properly trained as two-class classifiers using an artificial dataset for the negative class, obtained by generating samples uniformly distributed over the domain of the positive class dataset. The artificial dataset is used only for training, while the OCC is used on negative-class samples generated from a different pdf. We also derive a modified stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that provides OCC operating as LT without the need for the artificial dataset. Furthermore, we show that the OCLSSVM with suitable kernels operates as the LT at convergence. Lastly, we prove that the widely used autoencoder (AE) classifier generally does not provide the LT.</description>

      <title>Low Rank Matrix Completion via Robust Alternating Minimization in Nearly Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix $M\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, the low rank matrix completion problem asks us to find a rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ as $UV^\top$ for $U\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times k}$ and $V\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ by only observing a few entries specified by a set of entries $\Omega\subseteq [m]\times [n]$. In particular, we examine an approach that is widely used in practice -- the alternating minimization framework. Jain, Netrapalli, and Sanghavi [JNS13] showed that if $M$ has incoherent rows and columns, then alternating minimization provably recovers the matrix $M$ by observing a nearly linear in $n$ number of entries. While the sample complexity has been subsequently improved [GLZ17], alternating minimization steps are required to be computed exactly. This hinders the development of more efficient algorithms and fails to depict the practical implementation of alternating minimization, where the updates are usually performed approximately in favor of efficiency.
  In this paper, we take a major step towards a more efficient and error-robust alternating minimization framework. To this end, we develop an analytical framework for alternating minimization that can tolerate a moderate amount of errors caused by approximate updates. Moreover, our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde O(|\Omega| k)$, which is nearly linear in the time to verify the solution while preserving the sample complexity. This improves upon all prior known alternating minimization approaches which require $\widetilde O(|\Omega| k^2)$ time.</description>

      <title>The Rashomon Importance Distribution: Getting RID of Unstable, Single Model-based Variable Importance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13775v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying variable importance is essential for answering high-stakes questions in fields like genetics, public policy, and medicine. Current methods generally calculate variable importance for a given model trained on a given dataset. However, for a given dataset, there may be many models that explain the target outcome equally well; without accounting for all possible explanations, different researchers may arrive at many conflicting yet equally valid conclusions given the same data. Additionally, even when accounting for all possible explanations for a given dataset, these insights may not generalize because not all good explanations are stable across reasonable data perturbations. We propose a new variable importance framework that quantifies the importance of a variable across the set of all good models and is stable across the data distribution. Our framework is extremely flexible and can be integrated with most existing model classes and global variable importance metrics. We demonstrate through experiments that our framework recovers variable importance rankings for complex simulation setups where other methods fail. Further, we show that our framework accurately estimates the true importance of a variable for the underlying data distribution. We provide theoretical guarantees on the consistency and finite sample error rates for our estimator. Finally, we demonstrate its utility with a real-world case study exploring which genes are important for predicting HIV load in persons with HIV, highlighting an important gene that has not previously been studied in connection with HIV.

      <title>On the Stability of Iterative Retraining of Generative Models on their own Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00429v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have made tremendous progress in modeling complex data, often exhibiting generation quality that surpasses a typical human's ability to discern the authenticity of samples. Undeniably, a key driver of this success is enabled by the massive amounts of web-scale data consumed by these models. Due to these models' striking performance and ease of availability, the web will inevitably be increasingly populated with synthetic content. Such a fact directly implies that future iterations of generative models will be trained on both clean and artificially generated data from past models. In this paper, we develop a framework to rigorously study the impact of training generative models on mixed datasets -- from classical training on real data to self-consuming generative models trained on purely synthetic data. We first prove the stability of iterative training under the condition that the initial generative models approximate the data distribution well enough and the proportion of clean training data (w.r.t. synthetic data) is large enough. We empirically validate our theory on both synthetic and natural images by iteratively training normalizing flows and state-of-the-art diffusion models on CIFAR10 and FFHQ.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank MDPs with Continuous Action Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have recently emerged as a promising framework within the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), as they allow for provably approximately correct (PAC) learning guarantees while also incorporating ML algorithms for representation learning. However, current methods for low-rank MDPs are limited in that they only consider finite action spaces, and give vacuous bounds as $|\mathcal{A}| \to \infty$, which greatly limits their applicability. In this work, we study the problem of extending such methods to settings with continuous actions, and explore multiple concrete approaches for performing this extension. As a case study, we consider the seminal FLAMBE algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2020), which is a reward-agnostic method for PAC RL with low-rank MDPs. We show that, without any modifications to the algorithm, we obtain a similar PAC bound when actions are allowed to be continuous. Specifically, when the model for transition functions satisfies a H\"older smoothness condition w.r.t. actions, and either the policy class has a uniformly bounded minimum density or the reward function is also H\"older smooth, we obtain a polynomial PAC bound that depends on the order of smoothness.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference for pairwise comparison models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pairwise comparison models have been widely used for utility evaluation and ranking across various fields. The increasing scale of problems today underscores the need to understand statistical inference in these models when the number of subjects diverges, a topic currently lacking in the literature except in a few special instances. To partially address this gap, this paper establishes a near-optimal asymptotic normality result for the maximum likelihood estimator in a broad class of pairwise comparison models, as well as a non-asymptotic convergence rate for each individual subject under comparison. The key idea lies in identifying the Fisher information matrix as a weighted graph Laplacian, which can be studied via a meticulous spectral analysis. Our findings provide a unified theory for performing statistical inference in a wide range of pairwise comparison models beyond the Bradley--Terry model, benefiting practitioners with theoretical guarantees for their use. Simulations utilizing synthetic data are conducted to validate the asymptotic normality result, followed by a hypothesis test using a tennis competition dataset.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for max-sliced Wasserstein distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00666v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain essentially matching upper and lower bounds for the expected max-sliced 1-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure on a separable Hilbert space and its empirical distribution from $n$ samples. By proving a Banach space version of this result, we also obtain an upper bound, that is sharp up to a log factor, for the expected max-sliced 2-Wasserstein distance between a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on a Euclidean space and its symmetrized empirical distribution in terms of the operator norm of the covariance matrix of $\mu$ and the diameter of the support of $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Empowering Credit Scoring Systems with Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>
