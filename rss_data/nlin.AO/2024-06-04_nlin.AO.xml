      <title>Activity patterns in ring networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic and gap junction coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a ring network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with nonlocal synaptic and gap junction coupling. The corresponding neural field model supports solutions such as standing and travelling waves, and also lurching waves. We show that many of these solutions satisfy self-consistency equations which can be used to follow them as parameters are varied. We perform numerical bifurcation analysis of the neural field model, concentrating on the effects of varying gap junction coupling strength. Our methods are generally applicable to a wide variety of networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Renormalization Group: An introduction to heterogeneous coarse-graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) constitutes a fundamental framework in modern theoretical physics. It allows the study of many systems showing states with large-scale correlations and their classification in a relatively small set of universality classes. RG is the most powerful tool for investigating organizational scales within dynamic systems. However, the application of RG techniques to complex networks has presented significant challenges, primarily due to the intricate interplay of correlations on multiple scales. Existing approaches have relied on hypotheses involving hidden geometries and based on embedding complex networks into hidden metric spaces. Here, we present a practical overview of the recently introduced Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks. First, we present a brief overview that justifies the use of the Laplacian as a natural extension for well-known field theories to analyze spatial disorder. We then draw an analogy to traditional real-space renormalization group procedures, explaining how the LRG generalizes the concept of "Kadanoff supernodes" as block nodes that span multiple scales. These supernodes help mitigate the effects of cross-scale correlations due to small-world properties. Additionally, we rigorously define the LRG procedure in momentum space in the spirit of Wilson RG. Finally, we show different analyses for the evolution of network properties along the LRG flow following structural changes when the network is properly reduced.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to higher-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>
