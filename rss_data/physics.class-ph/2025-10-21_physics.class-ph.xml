      <title>The nonlinearity of helical springs: An energy-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general expression for the elastic potential energy of a helical spring is derived using the basic concepts of elasticity theory and geometry. Both the translational and the rotational displacement of the spring's moving ends are considered. The resulting expression is employed to derive the general relation between force and spring height, and corrections to Hooke's law are discussed. The results can be used to estimate the magnitude of non-linear effects in realistic situations, to predict how springs unwind under load, and to determine the spring constant when spring ends are allowed to rotate freely. This energy-based approach is suitable for inclusion in advanced mechanics courses. The results are validated via measurements on steel springs using a simple experimental setup appropriate for use in physics laboratories at all levels.</description>

      <title>Note on Jackson's formalism of gauge transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An outline is given of the derivation of two inhomogeneous wave equations in an influential 2002 AJP paper of Jackson on the transformation from the Lorenz gauge to other electromagnetic gauges. The derivation shows that, contrary to a statement in the paper, the function satisfying one of the equations is not associated with the Coulomb-gauge vector potential but is associated with the Lorenz-gauge vector potential instead.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic constitutive model for rubber-like materials based on the first Seth strain measures invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical behaviour of isotropic and incompressible vulcanized natural rubbers (NR's) and that of quasi-incompressible carbon black filled vulcanized natural rubbers (NR 70) are considered both theoretically and experimentally. Based on the Seth strain measures in terms of the first invariant, an original form of the strain energy density function W is derived. This function is actually a generalisation of that of the neo-Hookean model and satisfies the hypothesis of the Valanis-Landel function. In the present study the analytical form of W is identified by using only simple tension test data (simple tension and simple planar compression). In our experiments, the two-dimensional field of in-plane homogeneous displacements is determined by using a home-developed image analysis cross-correlation technique. Our model is also identified using results taken from the literature in the case of (NR's) tested under simple tension, equibiaxial tension and pure shear. Comparison of numerical results with the experimental data indicates that the present model can characterise the hyperelastic behaviour of NR's and that of NR 70 for all the tested modes of deformation. Moreover, it seems to be valid over a wide range of deformation.</description>

      <title>Lattice-induced sound trapping in biperiodic metasurfaces of acoustic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A referential example of a physical system that supports bound states in the continuum (BICs) with an infinite quality factor ($Q$-factor) is a subwavelength lattice of discrete scatterers (resonators) whose response can be significantly modified by exploiting lattice interactions. In this work, we explore the interference Friedrich-Wintgen mechanism for realizing acoustic BICs (trapped modes) at the $\Gamma$-point (in-plane Bloch wave vector $\mathbf{k}_{\parallel} = \mathbf{0}$) in biperiodic lattices of acoustic resonators with one resonator per unit cell. To do so, we expand the pressure field from the lattice into a series of scalar zonal ($m = 0$) spherical multipoles, carried by a normally incident plane wave, and formulate analytical conditions on the resonator's multipole moments under which an eigenmode becomes a BIC. The conditions allow us to determine the lattice constant and frequency values that enable the formation of the axisymmetric BIC due to the destructive interference of radiation from zonal multipole moments of a certain parity, although each moment radiates individually. By employing the T-matrix method for acoustic metasurfaces, we numerically investigate the BIC resonance in various structures, including finite arrays, and also the transformation of such resonances into high-$Q$ quasi-BIC regimes, which can be excited by a plane wave at normal incidence.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Classical Dirac particle I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we produce a classical Lagrangian description of an elementary spinning particle which satisfies Dirac equation when quantized. We call this particle a classical Dirac particle. We analyze in detail the way we arrive to this model and how the different observables and constants of the motion can be expressed in terms of the degrees of freedom and their derivatives, by making use of Noether's theorem. The main feature is that the particle has a center of charge r, moving at the speed of light, that satisfies fourth-order diferential equations and all observables can be expressed only in terms of this point and their time derivatives. The particle has also a center of mass q, that is a different point than the center of charge. This implies that two different spin observables can be defined, one S with respect to the point r and another SCM with respect to the point q, that satisfy different dynamical equations. The spin S satisfies the same dynamical equation than Dirac's spin operator. The fourth-order differential equations for the point r can be transformed into a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for the center of charge and center of mass. The dynamics can be described in terms of dimensionless variables. The possible interaction Lagrangians are described and we devote the main part of the work to the electromagnetic interaction of the Dirac particle with uniform and oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The numerical integrations of the dynamical equations are performed with different Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested reader.</description>
