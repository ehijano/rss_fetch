      <title>Large Cold Dust Reservoir Revealed in Transitional SN Ib 2014C by James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 2014C is a rare transitional event that exploded as a hydrogen-poor, helium-rich Type Ib SN and subsequently interacted with a hydrogen-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) a few months post explosion. This unique interacting object provides an opportunity to probe the mass-loss history of a stripped-envelope SN progenitor. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we observed SN 2014C with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer at 3477 days post explosion (rest frame), and the Near-InfraRed Spectrograph Integral Field Unit at 3568 days post explosion, covering 1.7 to 25 $\mu$m. The bolometric luminosity indicates that the SN is still interacting with the same CSM that was observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope 40--1920 days post explosion. JWST spectra and near-contemporaneous optical and near-infrared spectra show strong [Ne II] 12.831 $\mu$m, He 1.083 $\mu$m, H$\alpha$, and forbidden oxygen ([O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364, [O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7319, 7330, and [O III] $\lambda$$\lambda$4959, 5007) emission lines with asymmetric profiles, suggesting a highly asymmetric CSM. The mid-IR continuum can be explained by ~0.036 $M_\odot$ of carbonaceous dust at ~300 K and ~0.043 $M_\odot$ of silicate dust at $\sim$200 K. The observed dust mass has increased tenfold since the last Spitzer observation 4 yr ago, with evidence suggesting that new grains have condensed in the cold dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks. This dust mass places SN 2014C among the dustiest SNe in the mid-IR and supports the emerging observational trend that SN explosions produce enough dust to explain the observed dust mass at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Reflection Signatures of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary signatures and the feasibility of identifying them through X-ray reflection spectra. The X-ray emitting region is modeled as a set of two mini-disks bound to the individual SMBHs separated by 100 $GM/c^2$ and the spectra calculated as a function of the mass, mass ratio, and total accretion rate of the binary. The X-ray reflection features are strongly influenced by the accretion-inversion phenomenon expected in SMBH binaries, which results in a wide range of ionization conditions in the two mini-disks. These are imprinted in the resulting composite spectra and the double-peaked and time-variable relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles. To test whether these features can be used as evidence for the presence of an SMBH binary, we fit mock 100\,ks observations with a single AGN model. For a $10^9$ $M_\odot$ binary targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), at $z=0.1$ the single AGN model clearly fails to fit the data, while at $z=1$ the fit is acceptable but unable to converge on the SMBH spin. For a $10^6$ $M_\odot$ binary, a progenitor of a \textit{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (\textit{LISA}) source, spectral fitting is only possible at $z=0.1$, with the outcomes similar to the PTA binary at $z=1$. We also find that PTA binaries can be expected to show a distinct X-ray spectral variability in multi-epoch observations, whereas for \textit{LISA} precursors, orbital averaging results in the loss of spectral variability signatures.</description>

      <title>X-ray and radio polarimetry of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first X-ray and radio polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) atoll-source 4U 1728-34 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We discovered that the X-ray source was polarized at PD = 1.9 +/- 1.0% (3-sigma errors) with a polarization angle of PA = -41 +/- 16 degree (3-sigma errors). Simultaneous Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations show that the source was in a relatively hard state, marking it as the first IXPE observation of an NS atoll source in the hard state. We do not detect any significant linear polarization (LP) in the radio band, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 2% at 5.5 GHz and 1.8% at 9 GHz. Combining the radio datasets provides the deepest upper limits on the radio polarization at &lt; 1.5% on the linear and circular polarization (measured at 7.25 GHz). The X-ray polarimetric results suggest a source geometry with a Comptonization component possibly attributed to a boundary layer (BL) emission reflected off the disk, consistent with the other NS atoll sources.</description>

      <title>Binary Stars Approaching Supermassive Black Holes: Hydrodynamics of Stellar Collisions, Mass Fallback and Partial TDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When binaries are injected into low-angular-momentum orbits around a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), various outcomes can occur, including binary tidal breakup, double stellar disruptions and stellar collision. We use hydrodynamical simulations to study stellar collisions triggered by binary-SMBH encounters, examining both head-on and grazing collisions in deep ($\beta_b=5$) and gentle ($\beta_b=0.6$) encounters, where $\beta_b$ is the ratio of the binary tidal disruption radius to the binary pericenter distance to the SMBH. Head-on collisions consistently result in appreciable mass loss ($\sim 5\%$) and a single merger remnant. Grazing collisions in deep encounters typically leave two strongly disturbed stars with comparable mass loss, while in gentle encounters, multiple collisions eventually produce a single remnant with minimal mass loss ($\lesssim 1\%$). All merger remnants feature extended envelopes, making them susceptible to partial tidal disruptions when they return to the SMBH. The morphology and orbital energy distribution of collision-induced debris differ significantly from those of tidal disruption event (TDE) debris of single stars. Approximately half of the collision-generated debris falls back onto the SMBH, exhibiting a distinct time evolution of the fallback rate. We suggest that such mass loss and fallback can generate electromagnetic flares that mimic weak TDEs.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Origin of HFQPOs of GRS 1915+105 during 'Canonical' Soft States: An In-depth View using Multi-mission observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the 'canonical' soft state ($\gamma$, $\delta$, and $\phi$ spectral variability classes) of the black hole binary GRS 1915+105, using RXTE, AstroSat, and NuSTAR data from 1996 to 2017 to investigate the origin of High Frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs). Our findings reveal that HFQPOs occur only in the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ classes, with frequencies of $65.07-71.38$ Hz and are absent in the $\phi$ class. We observe an evolution of time-lag from hard-lag (1.59$-$7.55 ms) in RXTE to a soft-lag (0.49$-$1.68 ms) in AstroSat observations. Wide-band (0.7$-$50 keV) spectral modelling suggests that HFQPOs are likely observed with a higher covering fraction ($f_{cov} \gtrsim 0.5$), i.e., the fraction of seed photons being Comptonized in the corona, enhanced Comptonized flux ($\sim$ 38%), and lower optical depth ($\tau \lesssim 8.5$ ) in contrast to observations where HFQPOs are absent. We observed similar constraints for observing HFQPOs during an inter-class ($\phi \rightarrow \delta$) transition as well as in a few intra-class ($\delta \rightarrow \delta$) variations. We also find that the time-lag decreases as $\tau$ increases, indicating that a higher $\tau$ reduces Compton up-scattering, thereby decreasing the hard-lag. Interestingly, in RXTE observations, the hard-lag ($\sim$ 7 ms) gradually decreases as optical depth and Comptonization ratio increases, eventually becoming a soft-lag ($\sim$1 ms) in AstroSat observations. These constraints on spectro-temporal parameters for the likelihood of observing HFQPOs support a 'compact' coronal oscillation mechanism for generating HFQPOs, which we attempt to explain within the framework of a possible accretion scenario.</description>

      <title>Inferring Dense Confined Circumstellar Medium around Supernova Progenitors via Long-term Hydrodynamical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumstellar interaction of supernova (SN) ejecta is an essential process in its evolution and observations of SNe have found the signature of circumstellar interaction both in the early and late evolutionary phase of SNe. In this Letter, we show that if the SN forward shock plunges into tenuous stellar wind from dense circumstellar medium (CSM) in the vicinity of the progenitor (i.e., confined CSM), the subsequent time evolutions of the SN-CSM interaction system deviates from the prediction of self-similar solution. In this case, after all of the confined CSM is swept up by the SN forward shock (roughly $10$ days after the explosion), the propagation of the shocked shell will be driven by the freely expanding ram pressure of the confined CSM component, instead of the SN ejecta. Meanwhile, the forward shock decelerates faster than the prediction of thin-shell approximation once the confined CSM component reaches homologous expansion. This lasts until the reverse shock in the confined CSM component reaches the head of the SN ejecta, leading to the restoration of the system into the evolutionary model without confined CSM, where the SN ejecta drives the expansion of the system. We also show that this peculiar evolution will be reflected in observational signatures originating from SN-CSM interaction, taking rapid decline and rebrightening of radio emission as examples. Our results shed light on the importance of taking into account the effect of initial SN-CSM interaction even when we focus on observational properties of SNe a few years after the explosion.</description>

      <title>Examining Lorentz invariance violation with three remarkable GRB photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation in photons can be quantified by measuring the difference in arrival times between high- and low-energy photons originating from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). When analyzing data, it is crucial to consider the inherent time delay in the emission of these photons at the source of the GRB. In a recent study, three distinct models were evaluated to explain the intrinsic emission times of high-energy photons by analyzing 14 multi-GeV photon events detected from 8 GRBs using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST). In this study, we examine three remarkable GRB photons recorded by different observatories: the 99.3~GeV photon from GRB 221009A observed by FGST, the 1.07~TeV photon from GRB 190114C detected by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope, and the 12.2~TeV photon from GRB 221009A observed by the Large High Altitude Air-shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our analysis indicates that the newly proposed model with a linear relationship between photon energy and intrinsic emission time can offer a consistent framework to explain the behavior of all three exceptional photons with a Lorentz violation scale $E_{\rm LV}\sim 3\times 10^{17}$~GeV.</description>

      <title>The impact of ultraviolet suppression on the rates and properties of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae detected by LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to discover up to two orders of magnitude more strongly lensed supernovae per year than have so far been observed. Of these, Type IIn supernovae have been predicted to be detected more frequently than any other supernova type, despite their small relative detection fraction amongst non-lensed supernovae. However, previous studies that predict a large population of lensed Type IIn supernova detections model their time evolving spectrum as a pure blackbody. In reality, there is a deficit in the UV flux of supernovae relative to the blackbody continuum due to line-blanketing from iron-group elements in the ejecta and scattering effects. In this work we quantify the effect of this UV suppression on the detection rates by LSST of a simulated population of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae, relative to a pure blackbody model, using a mock LSST observing run. With a blackbody model, we predict to detect $\sim$70 lensed Type IIn supernova per year with LSST. By modelling a similar UV deficit to that seen in superluminous supernovae, we recover 60 - 80% of the detections obtained using a pure blackbody model, of which $\sim$10 detections per year are sufficiently bright ($m_\textrm{i} &lt; 22.5$ mag) and detected early enough (&gt; 5 observations before lightcurve peak) to enable high-cadence spectroscopic follow up.</description>

      <title>Red Supergiant problem viewed from the nebular phase spectroscopy of type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The red supergiant (RSG) problem refers to the observed dearth of luminous RSGs identified as progenitors of Type II supernovae (SNe II) in pre-SN imaging. Understanding this phenomenon is essential for studying pre-SN mass loss and the explodability of core-collapse SNe. In this work, we re-assess the RSG problem using late-phase spectroscopy of a sample of 50 SNe II. The [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6363 emission in the spectra is employed to infer the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass distribution of the progenitors, which is then transformed into a luminosity distribution via an observation-calibrated mass-luminosity relation. The resulting luminosity distribution reveals an upper cutoff at log $L/L_{\odot} = 5.21^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex, and the RSG problem is statistically significant at the 2$\sigma$ to 3$\sigma$ level. Assuming single RSG progenitors that follow the mass-luminosity relation of KEPLER models, this luminosity cutoff corresponds to an upper ZAMS mass limit of $20.63^{+2.42}_{-1.64}$ $M_{\odot}$. Comparisons with independent measurements, including pre-SN imaging and plateau-phase light curve modeling, consistently yield an upper ZAMS mass limit below about 25 $M_{\odot}$, with a significance level of 1-3$\sigma$. While each individual method provides only marginal significance, the consistency across multiple methodologies suggests that the lack of luminous RSG progenitors may reflect a genuine physical problem. Finally, we discuss several scenarios to account for this issue should it be confirmed as a true manifestation of stellar physics.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarization of the BL Lac Type Blazar H 1426+428</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the X-ray polarization properties of the high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac H 1426+428, based on two-epoch observational data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). For the first observation, only an upper limit of polarization degree ($\Pi_{\rm X}$), $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;19.5\%$, at the 99\% confidence level (C.L.) is determined. In contrast, for the second observation, we derive $\Pi_{\rm X}=20.6\%\pm2.9\%$ with a polarization angle ($\psi_{\rm X}$) of $\psi_{\rm X}=116.1^{\circ}\pm4.1^{\circ}$ at a C.L. of 7.1 $\sigma$. The time-resolved and energy-resolved polarization analysis reveals no significant variation in $\psi_{\rm X}$ and no detectable polarization within narrower energy bins for the first observation, while the polarization during the second observation is predominantly dominated by low-energy photons. Furthermore, the X-rays during the second observation are found to be in a higher flux state with a harder spectrum compared to that observed during the first observation, consistent with a {\it harder-when-brighter} behavior. We propose that the plasma responsible for the X-ray emission during the first observation propagates downstream and encounters a shock, leading to electron acceleration and more ordered of the magnetic fields. The enhanced X-ray emission observed during the second observation is produced by shock-accelerated electrons within an ordered magnetic field region via synchrotron radiation. No significant detection of polarization during the first IXPE observation may be due to the limited number of detected photons.</description>

      <title>Quasi-thermal Photosphere Emission from Structured Jets of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is supposed to be released from the relativistic jet launched from the central engine. Apart from the non-thermal nature of the spectra in a majority of GRBs, there is evidence for the presence of quasi-thermal components in the prompt emission of a few GRBs according to observations by Fermi satellite. On the other hand, the GRB jet has been revealed as structured in recent research. The theoretical observed spectra of photosphere emissions by an off-axis observer and the dependence of the spectra on the viewing angle under the assumption of structured jets remain unexplored. In this paper, we numerically calculate the instantaneous photosphere spectra by different viewing angles from a structured jet, from which relevant temporal and spectral characteristics are derived. Moreover, we address the necessity of proper treatment of the outflow boundary in the photosphere emission scenario. Furthermore, our calculations suggest that the Einstein Probe and Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Object Monitor will have the capability to detect the short GRBs similar to GRB 170817A up to a luminosity distance of 200Mpc if the off-axis viewing angle is less than 10 degrees.</description>

Abstract: A search was carried out for pulsars with periods (P) from 2 to 90 s in daily observations carried out over an interval of 5 years in a area measuring 6300 sq.deg. The data was obtained on a Large Phased Array (LPA) at a frequency of 111 MHz. The periodograms calculated using the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA) were used for the search. To increase the sensitivity, the periodograms obtained in different observation sessions were added together. Of the 14 known pulsars that entered the study area, with periods of P&gt;2 s and dispersion measures (DM) less than 200 pc/cm$^3$, 9 were detected. 2 new pulsars have been found. The mean profiles of pulsars are obtained and estimates of their flux densities are given. The open pulsar J1951+28, with a period of P = 7.3342 s and DM = 3.5 pc/cm$^3$, turned out to be one of the pulsars closest to the Sun. The absence of new pulsars with periods of tens of seconds with a search sensitivity of 1 mJy outside the Galactic plane indicates a low probability of the existence of pulsars with extremely long periods. Most likely, the recently found sources of periodic radiation with periods from a minute to tens of minutes are white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Modeling transport in weakly collisional plasmas using thermodynamic forcing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How momentum, energy, and magnetic fields are transported in the presence of macroscopic gradients is a fundamental question in plasma physics. Answering this question is especially challenging for weakly collisional, magnetized plasmas, where macroscopic gradients influence the plasma's microphysical structure. In this paper, we introduce thermodynamic forcing, a new method for systematically modeling how macroscopic gradients in magnetized or unmagnetized plasmas shape the distribution functions of constituent particles. In this method, we propose to apply an anomalous force to those particles inducing the anisotropy that would naturally emerge due to macroscopic gradients in weakly collisional plasmas. We implement thermodynamic forcing in particle-in-cell (TF-PIC) simulations using a modified Vay particle pusher and validate it against analytic solutions of the equations of motion. We then carry out a series of simulations of electron-proton plasmas with periodic boundary conditions using TF-PIC. First, we confirm that the properties of two electron-scale kinetic instabilities -- one driven by a temperature gradient and the other by pressure anisotropy -- are consistent with previous results. Then, we demonstrate that in the presence of multiple macroscopic gradients, the saturated state can differ significantly from current expectations. This work enables, for the first time, systematic and self-consistent transport modeling in weakly collisional plasmas, with broad applications in astrophysics, laser-plasma physics, and inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes are the sources of the strongest gravitational fields that can be found today in the Universe and are ideal laboratories for testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In this letter, I show that the possibility of an interstellar mission to send small spacecrafts to the nearest black hole, although very speculative and extremely challenging, is not completely unrealistic. Certainly we do not have the necessary technology today, but it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The mission may last 80-100 years, but we would be able to obtain very valuable information about black holes and General Relativity that could be unlikely obtained in other ways.</description>

      <title>The fate of the progenitors of Luminous Red Novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) discovered in the last three decades. In all these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. Instead, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR), and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in $Spitzer$ images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and $JWST$ NIR images 27 years after the outburst. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) is consistent with that of a red supergiant star with a photospheric temperature of 3200 K and a radius of 220 $R_{\odot}$, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation, as the source is not detected at 4.5 $\mu$m. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by $JWST$ 12.5 years after the outburst. From its SED, we find evidence for three black-body components: a warm/hot stellar component, a colder component from cool dust at 425 K, emitting between 3 and 6 $\mu$m, and a third even colder component responsible for the excess at 8 $\mu$m, possibly due to an IR echo. We construct the $[3.6]-[4.5]$ colour curves extending up to +7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: the MIR colour is $\sim0$ before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer ($\sim-0.5$ mag) at around +1 year, then it gradually turns to redder colours ($\sim+0.5$ mag) in the following years, before reaching $[3.6]-[4.5]\sim+1.5$ mag 7 years after the outburst. Finally, we also estimate the masses and the temperatures of newly-formed dust years after the LRN onset for different chemical compositions (silicates or graphite) and grain sizes (0.1 or 1.0 $\mu$m). We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (0.1-30)$\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ between 3.6 and 13 years after the outbursts, with temperatures in the range from 350 to 770 K.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Survival Guide: Searching for Stars in the Galactic Center That Endure Partial Tidal Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Once per 10,000-100,000 years, an unlucky star may experience a close encounter with a supermassive black hole (SMBH), partially or fully tearing apart the star in an exceedingly brief, bright interaction called a tidal disruption event (TDE). Remnants of partial TDEs are expected to be plentiful in our Galactic Center, where at least six unexplained, diffuse, star-like "G objects" have already been detected which may have formed via interactions between stars and the SMBH. Using numerical simulations, this work aims to identify the characteristics of TDE remnants. We take 3D hydrodynamic FLASH models of partially disrupted stars and map them into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to examine the properties of these remnants from tens to billions of years after the TDE. The remnants initially exhibit a brief, highly luminous phase, followed by an extended cooling period as they return to stable hydrogen burning. During the initial stage (&lt; 10,000 yr) their luminosities increase by orders of magnitude, making them intriguing candidates to explain a fraction of the mysterious G objects. Notably, mild TDEs are the most common and result in the brightest remnants during this initial phase. However, most remnants exist in a long-lived stage where they are only modestly offset in temperature and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of equivalent mass. Nonetheless, our results indicate remnants will sustain abnormal, metal-enriched envelopes that may be discernible through spectroscopic analysis. Identifying TDE survivors within the Milky Way could further illuminate some of the most gravitationally intense encounters in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time, a topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual and combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.</description>

      <title>Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the highest-energy astroparticle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superheavy dark matter has been attractive as a candidate of particle dark matter. We propose a "natural" particle model, in which the dark matter serves as the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles at energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \, \text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the inflation. A scalar field responsible to dilute the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation. Since the dark matter must be a spin zero scalar, we study carefully the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions and two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger bounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy scale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event, KM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further alleviate $\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable predictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons that are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of spectral indices, $\alpha_s\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of light new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider experiments. Further measurements of high energy cosmic rays, including their components and detailed coordinates may provide insight into not only the origin of the cosmic rays but also inflation.</description>

      <title>Fast neutrino flavor conversions in a supernova: Emergence, evolution, and effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) of neutrinos, which can occur in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), are multiangle effects. They depend on the angular distribution of the neutrino's electron lepton number (ELN). In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the FFCs by solving the multienergy and multiangle quantum kinetic equations with an extended set of collisional weak processes based on a static and spherically symmetric CCSN matter background profile. We investigate the emergence and evolution of FFCs in models featuring different ELN angular distributions, considering scenarios with two and three neutrino flavors. The spectrogram method is utilized to illustrate the small-scale spatial structure, and we show that this structure of neutrino flavor coherence and number densities in the nonlinear regime is qualitatively consistent with the dispersion relation analysis. On the coarse-grained level, we find that different asymptotic states can be achieved following the FFCs depending on the locations and shapes of the ELN distributions, despite sharing a common feature of the elimination of the ELN angular crossing. While equilibration among different neutrino flavors may be achieved immediately after the prompt FFCs, it is not a general outcome of the asymptotic state, as subsequent feedback effects from collisional neutrino-matter interactions come into play, particularly for cases where FFCs occur inside the neutrinosphere. The impacts of FFCs and the feedback effect on the net neutrino heating rates, the equilibrium electron fraction of CCSN matter, and the free-streaming neutrino energy spectra are quantitatively assessed. Other aspects including the impact of the vacuum term and the coexistence with other type of flavor instabilities are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter is hypothesized to interact with ordinary matter solely through gravity and may be present in compact objects such as strange quark stars. We treat strange quark stars admixed with dark matter as two-fluid systems to investigate the potential effects of dark matter on strange quark stars. Quark matter is described by the quasiparticle model and the extended MIT bag model for comparison. Dark matter is treated as asymmetric, self-interacting, and composed of massive fermionic particles. The two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations are employed to solve for specific stellar properties. Our analysis yields relations between central energy density and mass, radius and mass, as well as tidal deformability and mass. The calculated curves generally align with observational data. In particular, we find that the pattern in which fermionic asymmetric dark matter affects the properties of strange quark stars may not be influenced by the equation of state (EOS) of strange quark matter.</description>

      <title>The Soft X-ray Aspect of Gamma-ray Bursts in the Einstein Probe Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, dedicated at time-domain high-energy astrophysics and multi-messenger astronomy, was recently launched and successfully put into operation. The wide-field X-ray telescope (WXT, 0.5-4 keV) onboard has identified multiple gamma-ray burst (GRB) events, with an average duration of several hundred seconds. This duration is several times longer than the average duration of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which typically stands at several tens of seconds. Additionally, EP has detected some unknown X-ray transients whose connection to GRBs is uncertain, due to the absence of gamma-ray counterparts and efficient follow-up observation at multi-wavelengths. Several main factors could account for the longer time, including the Doppler effect of off-axis viewing, the spectral lag effect of the synchrotron spectrum of cooling electrons, and some unknown prolonged intrinsic X-ray activities. Our studies indicate that EP GRBs may primarily consist of off-axis viewed bursts, forming a unique population among the GRB zoo, yet the intrinsic origin for the specific bursts could not be excluded. By analyzing the statistical properties of the historical LGRB samples, we explored observable properties of on-axis and off-axis LGRBs in the soft X-ray band. The predicted characteristics of off-axis viewed GRBs, including the duration, energy fluence, low-energy spectral index, and the slopes of Amati and Yonetoku relations, could be tested with a larger sample of GRB events detected by EP in the future.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model of Kilonovae and GRBs in Binary Mergers Establishes Neutron Stars as the Central Engines of Short GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand the theoretical framework by Gottlieb el al. (2023), which connects binary merger populations with long and short binary gamma-ray bursts (lbGRBs and sbGRBs), incorporating kilonovae as a key diagnostic tool. We show that lbGRBs, powered by massive accretion disks around black holes (BHs), should be accompanied by bright, red kilonovae. In contrast, sbGRBs - if also powered by BHs - would produce fainter, red kilonovae, potentially biasing against their detection. However, magnetized hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnants that precede BH formation can produce jets with power ($P_{\rm NS} \approx 10^{51}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) and Lorentz factor ($\Gamma&gt;10$), likely compatible with sbGRB observations, and would result in distinctly bluer kilonovae, offering a pathway to identifying the sbGRB central engine. Recent modeling by Rastinejad et al. (2024) found luminous red kilonovae consistently accompany lbGRBs, supporting lbGRB originating from BH-massive disk systems, likely following a short-lived HMNS phase. The preferential association of sbGRBs with comparably luminous kilonovae argues against the BH engine hypothesis for sbGRBs, while the bluer hue of these KNe provides additional support for an HMNS-driven mechanism. Within this framework, BH-NS mergers likely contribute exclusively to the lbGRB population with red kilonovae. Our findings suggest that GW170817 may, in fact, have been an lbGRB to on-axis observers. Finally, we discuss major challenges faced by alternative lbGRB progenitor models, such as white dwarf-NS or white dwarf-BH mergers and accretion-induced collapse forming magnetars, which fail to align with observed GRB timescales, energies, and kilonova properties.</description>

      <title>Secular evolution of quasi-periodic eruptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. In this work, we propose an osculating trajectory method for efficiently calculating secular evolution of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) that are perturbed by an accretion disk. This method accelerates the calculation of EMRI orbital evolution by orders of magnitude and lays the foundation for analyzing long-term QPE observations. Applying this method to orbital analyses of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2, the two most stable QPE sources, we find informative constraints on the SMBH mass, the radiation efficiency of QPEs, the SMO nature, the accretion disk surface density and the accretion disk viscosity. Combining all the QPE sources available, we find the QPE EMRIs can be divided into two populations according to their orbital eccentricities, where the orbital periods and the SMBH masses in the low-eccentricity population follow a scaling relation $T_{\rm obt}\propto M_{\bullet}^n$ with $n\approx 0.8$.</description>

      <title>The BTSbot-nearby discovery of SN 2024jlf: rapid, autonomous follow-up probes interaction in an 18.5 Mpc Type IIP supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2024jlf, including spectroscopy beginning just 0.7 days ($\sim$17 hours) after first light. Rapid follow-up was enabled by the new $\texttt{BTSbot-nearby}$ program, which involves autonomously triggering target-of-opportunity requests for new transients in Zwicky Transient Facility data that are coincident with nearby ($D&lt;60$ Mpc) galaxies and identified by the $\texttt{BTSbot}$ machine learning model. Early photometry and non-detections shortly prior to first light show that SN 2024jlf initially brightened by $&gt;$4 mag/day, quicker than $\sim$90% of Type II SNe. Early spectra reveal weak flash ionization features: narrow, short-lived ($1.3 &lt; \tau ~\mathrm{[d]} &lt; 1.8$) emission lines of H$\alpha$, He II, and C IV. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w=50$ km s$^{-1}$, these properties indicate that the red supergiant progenitor exhibited enhanced mass-loss in the last year before explosion. We constrain the mass-loss rate to $10^{-4} &lt; \dot{M}~\mathrm{[M_\odot~yr^{-1}]} &lt; 10^{-3}$ by matching observations to model grids from two independent radiative hydrodynamics codes. $\texttt{BTSbot-nearby}$ automation minimizes spectroscopic follow-up latency, enabling the observation of ephemeral early-time phenomena exhibited by transients.</description>

      <title>Hyperluminous Supersoft X-Ray Sources in the Chandra Catalog</title>

Abstract: Hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources, such as bright extragalactic sources characterized by particularly soft X-ray spectra, offer a unique opportunity to study accretion onto supermassive black holes in extreme conditions. Examples of hyperluminous supersoft sources are tidal disruption events, systems exhibiting quasi-periodic eruptions, changing-look AGN, and anomalous nuclear transients. Although these objects are rare phenomena amongst the population of X-ray sources, we developed an efficient algorithm to identify promising candidates exploiting archival observations. In this work, we present the results of a search for hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources in the recently released Chandra catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources. This archival search has been performed via both a manual implementation of the algorithm we developed and a novel machine-learning-based approach. This search identified a new tidal disruption event, which might have occurred in an intermediate-mass black hole. This event occurred between 2001 and 2002, making it one of the first tidal disruption events ever observed by Chandra.</description>

      <title>Modeling fast X-ray variability around an accreting black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray inter-band time lags are observed during the outbursts of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). Timing analysis of fast variability in low Fourier frequency bands shows that high-energy photons lag behind low-energy photons, a phenomenon referred to as hard lag. Conversely, in high Fourier frequency bands, low-energy photons lag behind high-energy photons, known as soft lag. This frequency-dependent lag spectrum suggests that the lags arise from different physical processes. Notably, a trend has been observed wherein the lags shift towards shorter timescales during the rising hard state, indicating an evolution in the inner accretion flow. In this study, we simulate these inter-band lags by conducting Monte Carlo simulations of the rapid variability within the geometry of a jet base corona. We consider both inward propagating accretion rate fluctuations and reverberation (light crossing) delays in our simulations. We successfully reproduce both low-frequency hard lags and high-frequency soft lags in a self-consistent manner. We replicate the observed evolution of the frequency-dependent lag spectra by varying the geometrical scale of the corona and the viscous frequency of the disc. Finally, we discuss the potential of a spherical corona and emphasize that polarization observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP) will be crucial for distinguishing the corona's geometry in future studies.</description>

      <title>Disk reflection and energetics from the accreting millisecond pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting millisecond pulsars (AMSPs) are excellent laboratories to study reflection spectra and their features from an accretion disk truncated by a rapidly rotating magnetosphere near the neutron star surface. These systems also exhibit thermonuclear (type-I) bursts that can provide insights on the accretion physics and fuel composition. We explore spectral properties of the AMSP SRGA J144459 observed during the outburst that recently led to its discovery in February 2024. We aim to characterize the spectral shape of the persistent emission and to analyze type-I bursts properties employing XMM + NuSTAR overlapping observations taken during the most recent outburst. We perform spectral analysis of the time-averaged persistent (i.e., non-bursting) emission. For this, we first employ a semi-phenomenological continuum model made of a dominant thermal Comptonization plus two thermal contributions. A separate fit has also been performed employing a physical reflection model. We also perform time-resolved spectral analysis of a type-I burst employing a blackbody model. We observe a broadened iron emission line, thus suggesting relativistic effects, supported by the physical model accounting for relativistically blurred reflection. The resulting accretion disk extends down to 6 gravitational radii, inclined at ~$53^{\circ}$, and only moderately ionized (log$\xi\simeq2.3$). We observe an absorption edge at ~9.7 keV that can be interpreted as an Fe XXVI edge blueshifted by an ultrafast ($\simeq0.04$c) outflow. Our broadband observations of type-I bursts do not find evidence of photospheric radius expansion. The burst recurrence time shows a dependence on the count rate with the steepest slope ever observed in these systems. We also observe a discrepancy of ~3 between the observed and expected burst recurrence time, which we discuss in the framework of fuel composition and high NS mass scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Chinese pulsar timing array data release I. Polarimetry for 56 millisecond pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present polarization pulse profiles for 56 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) monitored by the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaboration using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The observations centered at 1.25 GHz with a raw bandwidth of 500 MHz. Due to the high sensitivity ($\sim$16 K/Jy) of the FAST telescope and our long integration time, the high signal-to-noise ratio polarization profiles show features hardly detected before. Among 56 pulsars, the polarization profiles of PSRs J0406$+$3039, J1327$+$3423, and J2022$+$2534 were not previously reported. 80\% of MSPs in the sample show weak components below 3\% of peak flux, 25\% of pulsars show interpulse-like structures, and most pulsars show linear polarization position angle jumps. Six pulsars seem to be emitting for full rotation phase, with another thirteen pulsars being good candidates for such a 360$^\circ$ radiator. We find that the distribution of the polarization percentage in our sample is compatible with the normal pulsar distribution. Our detailed evaluation of the MSP polarization properties suggests that the wave propagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere are important in shaping the MSP polarization pulse profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 12 observations of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Aql X-1, taken from August 2022 to October 2023 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope at 1250 MHz. These observations covered both the quiescence and X-ray outburst states, as determined by analyzing the X-ray data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. Periodicity and single-pulse searches were conducted for each observation, but no pulsed signals were detected. The obtained upper limit flux densities are in the range of 2.86-5.73 uJy, which provide the lowest limits to date. We discuss several mechanisms that may prevent detection, suggesting that Aql X-1 may be in the radio-ejection state during quiescence, where the radio pulsed emissions are absorbed by the matter surrounding the system.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernova explosions hindered by eV-mass sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.</description>

      <title>Forming a clumpy circumstellar material in energetic pre-supernova activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate by three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of energy deposition into the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) model the inflation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable envelope that forms a compact clumpy circumstellar material (CSM). Our simulations mimic vigorous core activity years to months before a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion that deposits energy to the outer envelope. The fierce core nuclear activity in the pre-CCSN explosion phase might excite waves that propagate to the envelope. The wave energy is dissipated where envelope convection cannot carry the energy. We deposit this energy into a shell in the outer envelope with a power of L(wave)=2.6e6Lo or L(wave)=5.2e5Lo for 0.32 year. The energy-deposition shell expands while its pressure is higher than its surroundings, but its density is lower. Therefore, this expansion is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and develops instability fingers. Most of the inflated envelope does not reach the escape velocity in the year of simulation but forms a compact and clumpy CSM. The high density of the inflated envelope implies that if a companion is present in that zone, it will accrete mass at a very high rate and power a pre-explosion outburst.</description>

      <title>A search for periodic activity in multi-peaked long gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sizeable fraction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs) features a sequence of peaks, which holds information on the unknown way energy is dissipated into gamma-rays over time. Traditional searches for periodic signals in GRB LCs turned out to be inconclusive, partly because they are challenging as a consequence of the short-lived, coloured-noise, and non-stationary nature of the LCs themselves. Yet, recent claims have revived the issue. We searched for periodic components in GRB LCs through a new approach to GRBs, that avoids most of the issues faced by traditional techniques. We identified peaks through a well tested algorithm and selected GRBs with at least 10 peaks out of 5 GRB catalogues (Swift/BAT, CGRO/BATSE, Fermi/GBM, Insight-HXMT, BeppoSAX/GRBM). Each GRB was simply treated as a discrete point process, whose realisation coincides with the sequence of peak times. We searched for possible periodic recurrences based on the multinomial distribution, after accounting for the clustering of peaks due to the non-stationarity of the GRB signals. The best candidate has a p-value of 3e-4 that there is no periodic recurrence. However, accounting for the multiple trials of 555 searched GRBs, its statistical significance is demoted to 17%. The overall distribution of the p-values obtained for all GRBs is compatible with a uniform distribution in [0,1]. We found no robust evidence for multi-peaked GRBs with periodic recurrences. We can exclude that a sizeable fraction (&gt;~ 0.75) of peaks of each GRB with at least 10 peaks are periodic. While our result does not necessarily clash with claimed periodicities based on Fourier techniques, it constrains the putative recurrent behaviour, which would not manifest itself through the sequence of peaks, but, evidently, in a more elusive way.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore their effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of H$_2$ and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continuous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. We estimate the alignment degree of SPEs from superparmagnetic (SPM) grains and find that it is only significant for SPM grains having large iron clusters and fast rotation. We suggest that low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned superparamagnetic grains with large iron inclusions induced by CRs might cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>Evolutions of in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross sections and stiffness of dense nuclear matter from Bayesian analyses of FOPI proton flow excitation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within a Bayesian statistical framework using a Gaussian Process (GP) emulator for an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions with momentum-independent Skyrme interactions, we infer from the proton directed and elliptical flow in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies from 150 to 1200 MeV/nucleon taken by the FOPI Collaboration the posterior Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross section (BBSCS) modification factor $X$ (with respect to their free-space values) and the stiffness parameter $K$ of dense nuclear matter. We find that the most probable value of $X$ evolves from around 0.7 to 1.0 as the beam energy $E_{beam}/A$ increases. On the other hand, the posterior PDF($K$) may have dual peaks having roughly the same height or extended shoulders at high $K$ values. More quantitatively, the posterior PDF($K$) changes from having a major peak around 220 MeV characterizing a soft EOS in the reaction at $E_{beam}/A$=150 MeV to one that peaks around 320 MeV indicating a stiff EOS in the reactions at $E_{beam}/A$ higher than about 600 MeV. The transition from soft to stiff happens in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies around 250 MeV/nucleon in which $K=220$ MeV and $K=320$ MeV are approximately equally probable. Altogether, the FOPI proton flow excitation function data indicate a gradual hardening of hot and dense nuclear matter as its density and temperature increase in reactions with higher beam energies.</description>

Abstract: The measurement of spin-precession and orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals is a key priority in GW astronomy, as these effects not only provide insights into the astrophysical formation and evolution of compact binaries but also, if neglected, could introduce significant biases in parameter estimation, searches, and tests of General Relativity. Despite the growing potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and future detectors to measure eccentric-precessing signals, accurately and efficiently modeling them remains a challenge. In this work, we present pyEFPE, a frequency-domain post-Newtonian (PN) waveform model for the inspiral of precessing-eccentric compact binaries. pyEFPE improves upon previous models by introducing analytical expressions for the Fourier mode amplitudes, enhancing the numerical stability of the multiple scale analysis framework, and adding recently derived PN corrections, critical to accurately describe signals in GW detectors. Additionally, we simplify the numerical implementation and introduce a scheme to interpolate the amplitudes, achieving a speedup of up to ~O(15) in the waveform computations, making the model practical for data analysis applications. We thoroughly validate pyEFPE by comparing it to other waveform models in the quasi-circular and eccentric-spin-aligned limits, finding good agreement. Additionally, we demonstrate pyEFPE's capability to analyze simulated GW events, accurately recovering the parameters of signals described by both pyEFPE and IMRPhenomXP. While pyEFPE still lacks important physical effects, such as higher-order PN corrections, higher-order modes, mode asymmetries, tidal interactions or the merger-ringdown phase, it represents a significant step towards more complete waveform models, offering a flexible and efficient framework that can be extended in future work to incorporate these effects.</description>
