      <title>Optimal illness policy for an unethical daycare center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While businesses are typically more profitable if their workers and communities are minimally exposed to diseases, the same is not true for daycare centers. Here it is shown that a daycare center could maximize its profits by maintaining a population of sick children within the center, with the intention to infect more children who then do not attend. Through a modification of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for disease spread we find the optimal number of sick children who should be kept within the center to maximize profits. We show that as disease infectiousness increases, the optimal attendance rate of sick children approaches zero, while the potential profit increases.</description>

      <title>Rate-induced tipping in a solvable model with the Allee effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel exactly solvable ordinary differential equation model for rate-induced tipping: a dynamic phenomenon of dynamical systems where a time-dependent parameter triggers the transition of stability of a system. Our model contains an Allee effect that induces a saddle point and admits an explicit solution along with the extinction threshold of a time-dependent Allee parameter. More specifically, we derive an integral inequality that serves as a necessary condition for the occurrence of rate-induced tipping. A remarkable point in the proposed model is that it can handle population extinction such that the solution completely vanishes in a finite amount of time. An unconditionally stable cubature method suitable for our model is proposed, and its superiority over the classical forward Euler method is discussed. We also discuss a fisheries application where inland fisheries rose and fell from modern times to the present in Japan. The proposed model serves as a tractable mathematical tool for studying rate-induced tipping phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20531v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of self-similar measures, particularly when the IFS does not satisfy the separation condition, but the sub-IFS at some level satisfies the separation condition. Further, we study the approximation of the space of Borel probability measures $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^m)$ with respect to the geometric mean error, i.e., the quantization dimension of order zero.</description>

      <title>Sustainable and Optimal Harvesting in a Seasonally Harvested Fishery with a Marine Protected Area: A Two-Patch Model with Bang-Bang and Singular Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a bioeconomic model for optimal fishery harvesting in a spatially heterogeneous habitat comprising both harvestable and preservation (reserve) zones. The population dynamics are governed by a hybrid system coupling continuous time within-season dynamics -mortality, harvesting, and dispersal -with a discrete-time Beverton-Holt reproduction map. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition $Fr &gt; 1$ for long-term population persistence, where $F$ encapsulates within-season survival including harvesting effects and $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate. Through bifurcation analysis, we demonstrate that marine protected areas (MPAs) significantly expand the sustainable parameter space. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we characterize the optimal harvesting strategy as a composite Bang-Singular-Bang control. We derive an explicit state-feedback formula for the singular arc and verify its optimality via the Generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition. Numerical simulations reveal that this dynamic strategy significantly outperforms constant maximum-effort policies, yielding higher cumulative revenue while maintaining the population above the critical collapse threshold through a stable "sawtooth" trajectory. Our results highlight that modest preservation (20-30% of habitat) allows for more intensive, profitable harvesting in open zones without risking resource extinction.</description>

      <title>Data-driven sparse identification of vector-borne disease dynamics with memory effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the human burden of vector-borne diseases from limited surveillance data remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of nonlinear transmission dynamics and delayed effects arising from vector ecology and human behavior. We develop a data-driven framework based on an extension of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to systems with distributed memory, enabling discovery of transmission mechanisms directly from time series data. Using severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) as a case study, we show that this approach can uncover key features of tick-borne disease dynamics using only human incidence and local temperature data, without imposing predefined assumptions on human case reporting. We further demonstrate that predictive performance is substantially enhanced when the data-driven model is coupled with mechanistic representations of tick-host transmission pathways informed by empirical studies. The framework supports systematic sensitivity analysis of memory kernels and behavioral parameters, identifying those most influential for prediction accuracy. Although the approach prioritizes predictive accuracy over mechanistic transparency, it yields sparse, interpretable integral representations suitable for epidemiological forecasting. This hybrid methodology provides a scalable strategy for forecasting vector-borne disease risk and informing public health decision-making under data limitations.</description>

      <title>Cheap2Rich: A Multi-Fidelity Framework for Data Assimilation and System Identification of Multiscale Physics -- Rotating Detonation Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the sim2real gap between computationally inexpensive models and complex physical systems remains a central challenge in machine learning applications to engineering problems, particularly in multi-scale settings where reduced-order models typically capture only dominant dynamics. In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence of a Unique Solution to Gamma Moment Closure for the Stochastic Ricker Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic Ricker difference equation $X_{n+1} = X_n \exp(r(1-X_n)) \varepsilon_n$, where $X_n$ is a random variable representing the population size and $\{\varepsilon_n\}$ denotes independent random perturbations with $E[\varepsilon_n] = 1$ and $E[\varepsilon_n^2] = v &gt; 1$. We derive a closed system of difference equations for the mean and variance of $X_n$ using the Gamma moment-closure technique and numerically verify the validity of the Gamma moment-closure approximation. By constructing an auxiliary function, we establish the necessary and sufficient condition, $v &lt; (2 - e^{-r})^2$, for the existence of the positive unique feasible equilibrium. We further verify its local stability with numerical analysis. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the validity of the Gamma moment approximation and illustrate how the interplay between the intrinsic growth rate $r$ and noise intensity $v$ determines population persistence. The results provide a unified theoretical framework for analyzing stochastic Gamma dynamics, offering new biological insights into the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of environmental variability.</description>

      <title>On global rigidity of transversely holomorphic Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study transversely holomorphic flows, i.e. those whose holonomy pseudo-group is given by biholomorphic maps. We prove that for Anosov flows on smooth compact manifolds, the strong unstable (respectively, stable) distribution is integrable to complex manifolds, on which the flow acts holomorphically. Furthermore, assuming its complex dimension to be one, it is uniquely integrable to complex affine one-dimensional manifolds, each moreover affinely diffeomorphic to $\mathbb C$, on which the flow acts affinely. In this case, the weak stable (respectively, unstable) foliation is transversely holomorphic, and even transversely projective if the flow is assumed to be topologically transitive. By combining these facts in low dimensions, our main result is as follows : if a transversely holomorphic Anosov flow on a smooth compact five-dimensional manifold is topologically transitive, then it is either $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the suspension of a hyperbolic automorphism of a complex torus, or, up to finite covers, $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the geodesic flow of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of boundary orbits (separatrices) of canonical regions (basins/neighbourhoods of equilibria) in holomorphic flows with real-valued time. We establish the continuity of transit times along these boundary orbits and classify possible path components of the boundary of flow-invariant domains. Thus, we provide central tools for topological and geometric constructions aimed at examining the role of blow-up scenarios in separatrix configurations of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors:
  First, we prove that the separatrices of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices with a blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time.
  Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in ["The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows", K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions.
  Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of Inhomogeneous sub-self-similar (ISSS) sets, building upon the foundations laid by Falconer (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 347 (1995) 3121-3129) in the study of sub-self-similar sets and drawing inspiration from Barnsley's work on inhomogeneous self-similar sets (Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 399 (1985), no. 1817, 24). We explore a range of examples of ISSS sets and elucidate a method to construct ISSS sets. We also investigate the upper and lower box dimensions of ISSS sets and discuss the continuity of the Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>On the intersection of Cantor sets and products of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kenyon and Peres (1991) showed that the Hausdorff dimension of intersections of randomly translated Cantor sets can be expressed in terms of the top Lyapunov exponent of a product of random matrices, and this exponent can be written as an integral with respect to stationary measures on the projective line. Although explicit computations are available when stationary measures are discrete, the continuous case has remained challenging.
  In this paper we introduce new combinatorial and analytic tools that allow us to compute the Lyapunov exponent, and hence the Hausdorff dimension, in a broad class of examples where stationary measures are continuous. As an application, we complete the dimension computation in the setting where a single digit is forbidden; for example, we determine the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of the middle-seventh Cantor set with a random translate of itself.</description>

      <title>Extinction and Persistence in a Stochastic Mpox Model with Hawkes-type Self-Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic human-rodent compartment model for Mpox transmission that combines diffusion noise with Hawkes self-exciting jumps in the human infection dynamics. Including Hawkes processes allows, for instance, to model the short but significant spikes in transmission happening after crowded events. For the coupled human-rodent system, we prove global existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions, derive a basic reproduction number R_0 that guarantees almost sure extinction when R_0 &lt; 1, and obtain explicit persistence-in-the-mean conditions for both infected rodents and humans, which define persistence thresholds for the joint dynamics. Numerical experiments show how clustered human transmission events, environmental variability and control measures shift these thresholds and shape the frequency and size of Mpox outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Affine mappings of translation surfaces: shrinking targets and Diophantine properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a translation surface whose Veech group $\Gamma$ is a lattice. We prove that the generic orbit of the group of affine homeomorphisms of $(X,\omega)$ can be used to approximate each point of $X$ with Diophantine precision. The proof utilizes an induced $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$-action on a fiber bundle $Y$ whose base is $SL_2(\mathbb{R})/\Gamma$ and whose fiber is $X$. We observe that this bundle embeds as an $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$-orbit closure in the moduli space of once marked translation surfaces, and hence we may invoke the spectral gap results of Avila and Gou\"ezel and a quantitative mean ergodic theorem for the $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$-action on the mean-zero, square-integrable functions on $Y$.</description>

      <title>Quasiregular maps of Sierpi\'nski carpet Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $f$ and $g$ are postcritically finite rational maps whose Julia sets $\mathcal{J}(f), \mathcal{J}(g)$, respectively, are Sierpi\'nski carpets, and if $\xi$ is a quasiregular map of the Riemann sphere $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ with $\xi^{-1}(\mathcal{J}(g))=\mathcal{J}(f)$, then $\xi$ is the restriction of a rational map to the Julia set $\mathcal{J}(f)$. Moreover, when $g=f$ we prove that, for some positive integers $k$ and $l$, $f^k\circ \xi^l=f^{2k}$. These conclusions extend the main results of M. Bonk, M. Lyubich, S. Merenkov, Quasisymmetries of Sierpi\'nski carpet Julia sets, Adv. Math, 301 (2016), 383-422. Finally, we demonstrate that when Julia sets of postcritically finite rational maps are not Sierpi\'nski carpets, say they are tree-like or gaskets, the above conclusions no longer hold.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Random Walks in the Quarter Plane and Periodic $4$-bar Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, of Darboux from 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with the finite group of random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$, obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. Explicit examples of random walks with the groups of orders higher than 10 are presented here for the first time, including orders 12, 14, 16. The same method applies to any higher order. We consider cases with singular biquadratics in a systematic manner. We establish a new two-way relationship between diagonal random walks and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar links for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem: after $n$ iterations, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one of the same orientation, that he solved for $n=2$, which was recently extended to $n=3$. We also study $k$-semi-periodicity as a natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing a new object, the secondary $(2,2)$ correspondence, and the related secondary cubic of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form, while the case $k=2$ was solved recently.</description>
