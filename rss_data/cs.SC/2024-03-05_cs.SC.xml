      <title>On the arithmetic complexity of computing Gr\"obner bases of comaximal determinantal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ matrix of homogeneous linear forms over a field $\Bbbk$. If the ideal $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ generated by minors of size $n-1$ is Cohen-Macaulay, then the Gulliksen-Neg{\aa}rd complex is a free resolution of $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$. It has recently been shown that by taking into account the syzygy modules for $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ which can be obtained from this complex, one can derive a refined signature-based Gr\"obner basis algorithm DetGB which avoids reductions to zero when computing a grevlex Gr\"obner basis for $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$. In this paper, we establish sharp complexity bounds on DetGB. To accomplish this, we prove several results on the sizes of reduced grevlex Gr\"obner bases of reverse lexicographic ideals, thanks to which we obtain two main complexity results which rely on conjectures similar to that of Fr\"oberg. The first one states that, in the zero-dimensional case, the size of the reduced grevlex Gr\"obner basis of $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ is bounded from below by $n^{6}$ asymptotically. The second, also in the zero-dimensional case, states that the complexity of DetGB is bounded from above by $n^{2\omega+3}$ asymptotically, where $2\le\omega\le 3$ is any complexity exponent for matrix multiplication over $\Bbbk$.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network for Constraint Acquisition through Tailored Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02042</link>

Abstract: The significance of learning constraints from data is underscored by its potential applications in real-world problem-solving. While constraints are popular for modeling and solving, the approaches to learning constraints from data remain relatively scarce. Furthermore, the intricate task of modeling demands expertise and is prone to errors, thus constraint acquisition methods offer a solution by automating this process through learnt constraints from examples or behaviours of solutions and non-solutions. This work introduces a novel approach grounded in Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on Symbolic Regression that, by setting suitable loss functions, constraints can be extracted directly from datasets. Using the present approach, direct formulation of constraints was achieved. Furthermore, given the broad pre-developed architectures and functionalities of DNN, connections and extensions with other frameworks could be foreseen.</description>

      <title>On Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} series of affine semi-regular polynomial sequences and related Gr\"{o}bner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07768</link>

Abstract: Gr\"{o}bner bases are nowadays central tools for solving various problems in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. A typical use of Gr\"{o}bner bases is the multivariate polynomial system solving, which enables us to construct algebraic attacks against post-quantum cryptographic protocols. Therefore, the determination of the complexity of computing Gr\"{o}bner bases is very important both in theory and in practice: One of the most important cases is the case where input polynomials compose an (overdetermined) affine semi-regular sequence. The first part of this paper aims to present a survey on Gr\"{o}bner basis computation and its complexity. In the second part, we shall give an explicit formula on the (truncated) Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} series associated to the homogenization of an affine semi-regular sequence. Based on the formula, we also study (reduced) Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideals generated by an affine semi-regular sequence and its homogenization. Some of our results are considered to give mathematically rigorous proofs of the correctness of methods for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideal generated by an affine semi-regular sequence.</description>
