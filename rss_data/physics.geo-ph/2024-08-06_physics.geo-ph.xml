      <title>Certain aspects of prestack deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we had shown that because of varying angles of incidence there is a varying degree of convolution down a trace and across a gather, necessitating deconvolution operators varying with time and offset. This idea is examined further in $t$-$x$ as well as $\tau$-$p$ domain. We suggest better ways to deconvolve data in $\tau$-$p$ domain, taking into account varying degree of convolution in this domain. We derive formulae for periods of surface multiples in $\tau$-$p$ domain, e.g., water column peg-legs and reverberations, which have a fixed period depending only on the value of $p$ -- and suggest a way to check/revise the picked velocity using the formulae, provided the multiples are well separated from the primary. Periodicity of two way surface multiples is also studied.</description>

      <title>Inner core heterogeneity induced by a large variation in lower mantle heat flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic mapping of the top of the inner core indicates two distinct areas of high P-wave velocity, the stronger one located beneath Asia, and the other located beneath the Atlantic. This two-fold pattern supports the idea that a lower-mantle heterogeneity can be transmitted to the inner core through outer core convection. In this study, a two-component convective dynamo model, where thermal convection is near critical and compositional convection is strongly supercritical, produces a substantial inner core heterogeneity in the rapidly rotating strongly driven regime of Earth's core. While the temperature profile that models secular cooling ensures that the mantle heterogeneity propagates as far as the inner core boundary (ICB), the distribution of heat flux at the ICB is determined by the strength of compositional buoyancy. A large heat flux variation $q^*$ of $O(10)$ at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), where $q^*$ is the ratio of the maximum heat flux difference to the mean heat flux at the CMB, produces a core flow regime of long-lived convection in the east and time-varying convection in the west. Here, the P-wave velocity estimated from the ICB heat flux in the dynamo is higher in the east than in the west, with the hemispherical difference of the same order as the observed lower bound, 0.5%. Additional observational constraints are satisfied in this regime -- the variability of high-latitude magnetic flux in the east is lower than that in the west; and the stratified F-layer at the base of the outer core, which is fed by the mass flux from regional melting of the inner core and magnetically damped, attains a steady-state height of $\sim$ 200 km.</description>

      <title>4D-Var using Hessian approximation and backpropagation applied to automatically-differentiable numerical and machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraining a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model with observations via 4D variational (4D-Var) data assimilation is often difficult to implement in practice due to the need to develop and maintain a software-based tangent linear model and adjoint model. One of the most common 4D-Var algorithms uses an incremental update procedure, which has been shown to be an approximation of the Gauss-Newton method. Here we demonstrate that when using a forecast model that supports automatic differentiation, an efficient and in some cases more accurate alternative approximation of the Gauss-Newton method can be applied by combining backpropagation of errors with Hessian approximation. This approach can be used with either a conventional numerical model implemented within a software framework that supports automatic differentiation, or a machine learning (ML) based surrogate model. We test the new approach on a variety of Lorenz-96 and quasi-geostrophic models. The results indicate potential for a deeper integration of modeling, data assimilation, and new technologies in a next-generation of operational forecast systems that leverage weather models designed to support automatic differentiation.</description>

      <title>Towards improved understanding of spontaneous imbibition into dry porous media using pore-scale direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to mathematically describe spontaneous imbibition are usually based on either macro-scale models, such as Richards equation, or simplified pore-scale models, such as the bundle of capillary tubes (BCTM) or pore-network modeling (PNM). It is well known that such models cannot provide full microscopic details of the multiphase flow processes and that many pore-scale mechanisms still lack proper mathematical descriptions. To improve the predictive capabilities of traditional models, a fundamental understanding of pore-scale dynamics is needed. The focus of this paper is obtaining detailed insight and consistent explanation of particular processes during capillary-controlled water imbibition into dry porous media. We use two-dimensional model geometries and perform fully dynamic volume-of-fluid based direct numerical simulations of air-water multiphase flow at the pore-scale, to study processes that generally are not considered in traditional models. More specifically, we investigate differences between converging and diverging geometries, dynamic pressure and meniscus reconfiguration during pore-filling events, and the influence of inertia and pore size on imbibition dynamics and the occurrence of capillary barriers. Furthermore, we perform a detailed comparison between non-interacting and interacting BCTM and study the impact of the narrow contractions on imbibition dynamics and the trapping of the non-wetting phase. Obtained knowledge can be used to improve predictive models, which are broadly relevant considering the importance of spontaneous imbibition in many different natural and industrial processes.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>
