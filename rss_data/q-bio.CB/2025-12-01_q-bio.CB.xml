      <title>Comment on "Repair of DNA Double-Strand Breaks Leaves Heritable Impairment to Genome Function"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bantele and colleagues recently reported that repair of a single CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) in the c-MYC topologically associated domain leads to a persistent depletion of chromatin interactions and long-term transcriptional attenuation across multiple generations of human cells. They interpret this observation as evidence for a previously unrecognized principle--"chromatin fatigue"--in which DSB repair generates a stable architectural defect that acts as a heritable impairment to genome function. Such an idea, if correct, would carry profound implications for genome biology, epigenetic inheritance, cancer evolution, aging, and the safety of therapeutic genome editing. However, our detailed reassessment of the experimental design, underlying assumptions, and data interpretation reveals that the evidence provided is inadequate to support these sweeping conclusions. Instead, the observed outcomes are more plausibly explained by a combination of Cas9 persistence, off-target DNA damage, repair-factor retention, MYC enhancer plasticity, and the well-documented genomic instability of HeLa cells. The study does not demonstrate mechanistic causality, does not exclude simpler explanations, and does not provide data consistent with true chromatin memory or heritable architectural change. Moreover, its statistical inferences are based on noisy measurements that fall within expected variability of unstable oncogenic loci. Here, we present a comprehensive critical analysis showing that the proposed model of chromatin fatigue is unsupported by the available evidence. We offer a corrected interpretation in which the chromatin landscape experiences a temporary, repair-associated perturbation that resolves without leaving enduring or heritable impairment.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Direct Targeting and Regulation of RNA Polymerase II by Cell Signaling Kinases"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dabas et al. in Science 2025 report that approximately 117 human kinases directly phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), proposing an extensive, direct biochemical bridge between signal transduction and transcriptional control. Such a sweeping claim that one-fourth of the human kinome directly targets the CTD represents a profound revision of canonical transcriptional biology. However, the evidence presented relies primarily on in vitro kinase assays using short CTD peptides, sparse in-cell validation, and mechanistically incomplete models of nuclear trafficking, chromatin targeting, structural compatibility, and catalytic specificity. In this extended critique, we demonstrate that the conclusions of this study are not supported by current biochemical, structural, cell biological, or genomic data. We outline severe shortcomings in assay design, lack of quantitative kinetics, incompatibilities with known Pol II structural constraints, unsupported assumptions about nuclear localization, inappropriate extension to "direct-at-gene" mechanisms, absence of global transcriptional effects, failure to align with the essential role of canonical CDKs, and missing transparency in dataset reporting. We conclude that the central claims of the study are premature and contradicted by decades of established transcriptional research. Substantial new evidence is required before revising the mechanistic model of Pol II CTD regulation.</description>
