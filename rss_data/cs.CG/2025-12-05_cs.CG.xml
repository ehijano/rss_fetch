      <title>Unavoidable patterns and plane paths in dense topological graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $C_{s,t}$ be the complete bipartite geometric graph, with $s$ and $t$ vertices on two distinct parallel lines respectively, and all $s t$ straight-line edges drawn between them. In this paper, we show that every complete bipartite simple topological graph, with parts of size $2(k-1)^4 + 1$ and $2^{k^{5k}}$, contains a topological subgraph weakly isomorphic to $C_{k,k}$. As a corollary, every $n$-vertex simple topological graph not containing a plane path of length $k$ has at most $O_k(n^{2 - 8/k^4})$ edges. When $k = 3$, we obtain a stronger bound by showing that every $n$-vertex simple topological graph not containing a plane path of length 3 has at most $O(n^{4/3})$ edges. We also prove that $x$-monotone simple topological graphs not containing a plane path of length 3 have at most a linear number of edges.</description>

Abstract: This book introduces the new research area of Geometric Data Science, where data can represent any real objects through geometric measurements.
  The first part of the book focuses on finite point sets. The most important result is a complete and continuous classification of all finite clouds of unordered points under rigid motion in any Euclidean space. The key challenge was to avoid the exponential complexity arising from permutations of the given unordered points. For a fixed dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, the times of all algorithms for the resulting invariants and distance metrics depend polynomially on the number of points.
  The second part of the book advances a similar classification in the much more difficult case of periodic point sets, which model all periodic crystals at the atomic scale. The most significant result is the hierarchy of invariants from the ultra-fast to complete ones. The key challenge was to resolve the discontinuity of crystal representations that break down under almost any noise. Experimental validation on all major materials databases confirmed the Crystal Isometry Principle: any real periodic crystal has a unique location in a common moduli space of all periodic structures under rigid motion. The resulting moduli space contains all known and not yet discovered periodic crystals and hence continuously extends Mendeleev's table to the full crystal universe.</description>

      <title>Simpler is Faster: Practical Distance Reporting by Sorting Along a Space-Filling Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Range reporting is a classical problem in computational geometry. A (rectangular) reporting data structure stores a point set $P$, such that, given a (rectangular) query region $\Delta$, it returns all points in $P \cap \Delta$. A variety of data structures support such queries with differing asymptotic guarantees such as k-d trees, range trees, R-trees, and quadtrees. A common variant of range queries are distance reporting queries, where the input is a query point $q$ and a radius $\delta$, and the goal is to report all points in $P$ within distance $\delta$ of $q$. Such queries frequently arise as subroutines in geometric data structures. Practical implementations typically answer distance queries through rectangular range queries using the data structures listed before.
  This paper revisits a simple and practical heuristic for distance reporting, originally proposed in TCS'97: sort the input point set~$P$ along a space-filling curve. Queries then reduce to scanning at most four contiguous ranges along the sorted curve. The fact that sorting along a space-filling curve is beneficial for range reporting is well-known. Many implementations use this technique to speed up their query and construction times. The point that this paper makes is subtle, but interesting: we argue that often, it is the space-filling curve rather than the overall data structure that provides the performance benefits. Thus, we offer a simple but effective alternative: only sort $P$ along a space-filling curve instead.
  We compare this approach to eight range searching implementations, across an elaborate test suite of real-world and synthetic data. Our experiments confirm this simple 200-line code approach out-performs all high-end implementations in terms of space usage and construction time. It presents almost always the best query times. In a dynamic setting, our approach dominates in performance.</description>

      <title>Stability of 0-dimensional persistent homology in enriched and sparsified point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give bounds for dimension 0 persistent homology and codimension 1 homology of Vietoris--Rips, alpha, and cubical complex filtrations from finite sets related by enrichment (adding new elements), sparsification (removing elements), and aligning to a grid (uniformly discretizing elements). For enrichment we use barycentric subdivision, for sparsification we use a minimum separating distance, and for aligning to a grid we take the quotient when dividing each coordinate value by a fixed step size. We are motivated by applications presenting large and irregular datasets, and the development of persistent homology to better work with them. In particular, we consider an application to ecology, in which the state of an observed species is inferred through a high-dimensional space with environmental variables as dimensions. This ``hypervolume'' has geometry (volume, convexity) and topology (connectedness, homology), which are known to be related to the current and potentially future status of the species. We offer an approach for the analysis of hypervolumes with topological guarantees, complementary to current statistical methods, giving precise bounds between persistence diagrams of Vietoris--Rips and alpha complexes, and a duality identity for cubical complexes. Implementation of our methods, called TopoAware, is made available in C++, Python, and R, building upon the GUDHI library.</description>
