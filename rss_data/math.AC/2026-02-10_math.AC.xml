      <title>Generalized binomial edge ideals of whisker graphs via an extension of generalized corona products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of generalized binomial edge ideals of whisker graphs by working within a substantially broader class of graphs. We extend the notion of generalized corona products, and through this enlarged framework, investigate fundamental algebraic invariants such as depth, (Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity, and the Cohen-Macaulay property. In particular, we establish a sharp lower bound on the depth of generalized binomial edge ideals for our extended class, and further obtain explicit depth formula for a broad subclass of this family, which in turn recovers the depth formula for whisker graphs. We also establish sharp upper bounds for the regularity, and in the case of binomial edge ideals of whisker graphs over gap-free graphs, determine the exact value of the regularity. Finally, for our extended class, we provide a combinatorial classification of all Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals, which in turn yields a new construction of Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals.</description>

      <title>On homological invariants and Cohen-Macaulayness of closed neighborhood ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and $NI(G)$ be the closed neighborhood ideal of $G$ in the polynomial ring $S=K[V(G)]$. In this paper, we study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, projective dimension and Cohen-Macaulayness of this ideal. For any chordal graph $G$, we show that $\text{reg}(S/NI(G))=\tau(G)$, where $\tau(G)$ denotes the vertex cover number of $G$. This generalizes the corresponding result for trees shown in \cite{CJRS}, as in trees $\tau(G)$ is the same as the matching number of $G$. When $G$ is a bipartite graph or a very well-covered graph, we notice that $\text{reg}(S/NI(G))\geq \tau(G)$ and that this inequality can be strict in general. Moreover, we describe the projective dimension of $S/NI(G)$ for some families of graphs. Finally, we give a characterization of very well-covered graphs $G$ for which the ring $S/NI(G)$ is Cohen-Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Modules of minimal multiplicity over one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finitely generated modules of minimal multiplicity, a notion introduced by Puthenpurakal that extends the classical concept of minimal multiplicity from rings to modules. Our main result characterizes when trace ideals or reflexive ideals yield modules of minimal multiplicity over one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local rings. As a consequence, we show that a one-dimensional non-Gorenstein reduced local ring with a canonical module has minimal multiplicity if and only if its canonical module has minimal multiplicity as a module. We also construct several examples and compare them with Burch and Ulrich modules, highlighting cases where minimal multiplicity coincides with the Burch or Ulrich property.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Diagonalizing Matrices of Formal Power Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the unitary diagonalization of matrices over formal power series rings. Our main result shows that a normal matrix is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial completely splits over the ring and the associated spectral projections have entries in the ring. Building on this characterization, we develop an algorithm for deciding the unitary diagonalizability of matrices over regular local rings of algebraic varieties. A central ingredient of the algorithm is a decision procedure for determining whether a polynomial splits over a formal power series ring; we establish this using techniques from prime decomposition and the relative smoothness of integral closures in ramification theory.</description>

      <title>Elementary characterisation of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ by its absolute Galois group -- A modern perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1927, Artin and Schreier showed that a field is real closed if and only if its absolute Galois group has order two. Inspired by this characterisation and drawing on earlier work of Neukirch, Pop conjectured the following $p$-adic analogue: a field is $p$-adically closed if and only if its absolute Galois group is isomorphic to that of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. In 1995, the conjecture was independently solved by Efrat for $p \ne 2$ and by Koenigsmann in full generality. Using novel techniques in the theory of valued fields developed over the last 25 years, we give a new elementary and self-contained proof of this theorem, which does not rely on local class field theory and Galois cohomology. We further highlight connections to the recent work of Jahnke-Kartas on perfectoid fields and model-theoretic transfer techniques. We provide a systematic account of all of our methods to encourage further investigations.</description>

Abstract: In this note we analyse the scrollar invariants of $k:1$ covers of $\mathbb P^1$ that factor through the normalisation of a nodal curve in the $m$-th Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb F_m$.

      <description>arXiv:2402.17852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a descent result for finite projective modules, motivated by a question in perfectoid geometry. Given a commutative ring $A$, we formulate a descent problem for descending a finite projective module over the Novikov ring with coefficients in $A$ to a finite projective module over $A$. The main theorem of this paper is that all such descent data are effective. As an application, we prove for every perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra $A$, a vector bundle on $\operatorname{Spd} A$ always descends to a vector bundle on $\operatorname{Spec} A$.</description>

      <title>On the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem over General Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rings over which an analogue of the Weierstrass preparation theorem holds for power series. We show that a commutative ring $R$ admits a factorization of every power series in $R[[x]]$ as the product of a polynomial and a unit if and only if $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local principal ideal rings. We also characterize Noetherian rings $R$ for which this factorization holds under the weaker condition that the coefficients of the series generate the unit ideal: this occurs precisely when $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local Noetherian integral domains. Beyond this, we investigate the failure of Weierstrass-type preparation in finitely generated rings and prove a general transcendence result for zeros of $p$-adic power series, producing a large class of power series over number rings that cannot be written as a polynomial times a unit. Finally, we show that for a finitely generated infinite commutative ring $R$, the decision problem of determining whether an integer power series (with computable coefficients) factors as a polynomial times a unit in $R[[x]]$ is undecidable.</description>

      <title>On $\mathfrak{m}$-adic Continuity of $F$-Splitting Ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $\mathfrak{m}$-adic continuity of Frobenius splitting dimensions and ratios for divisor pairs $(R,\Delta)$ in an $F$-finite local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m},k)$ of prime characteristic $p&gt;0$. Our main result states that if $R$ is an $F$-finite, $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein, Cohen-Macaulay local ring of prime characteristic $p&gt;0$, the Frobenius splitting numbers $a^{\Delta}_e(R)$ remain unchanged under a suitable small perturbation. Moreover, we establish a desirable inequality of Frobenius splitting dimensions under general perturbations. That is, $\dim (R/(\mathcal{P}(R/(f),\Delta|_{f})))\leq \dim (R/(\mathcal{P}(R/(f+\varepsilon),\Delta|_{(f+\varepsilon)})))$ for all $\varepsilon \in \mathfrak{m}^{N\gg0}$, providing an example that demonstrates strict improvement can occur.</description>

      <title>Radical splittings of toric ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $I_A \subset K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a toric ideal. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the toric variety $V(I_A)$, over an algebraically closed field, to be expressed as the set-theoretic intersection of other toric varieties. We also introduce the radical splitting number of $I_A$, denoted by ${\rm Split}_{\rm rad}(I_A)$, and compute its exact value in several cases, with particular emphasis on toric ideals arising from graphs. In particular, we show that ${\rm Split}_{\rm rad}(I_A)=3$ for toric ideals of complete bipartite graphs. Additionally, we prove that ${\rm Split}_{\rm rad}(I_A)$ coincides with the binomial arithmetical rank of $I_A$ when the height of $I_A$ is equal to 2.</description>

      <title>Uniformly S-projective relative to a module and its dual</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of uniformly S-projective (u-S-projective) relative to a module. Let S be a multiplicative subset of a ring R and M an R-module. An R-module P is said to be u-S-projective relative to M if for any u-S-epimorphism f : M \to N, the induced map HomR(P, f ): HomR(P, M ) \to HomR(P, N ) is a u-S-epimorphism. Dually, we also introduce u-S-injective relative to a module. Some properties of these notions are discussed. Several characterizations of u-S-semisimple modules are given in terms of these notions. The notions of u-S-quasi-projective and u-S-quasi-injective modules are also introduced, and some of their properties are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study the monoid algebra ${}_{n}\mathcal{T}_{m}$ of semistandard Young tableaux, which coincides with the Gelfand--Tsetlin semigroup ring $\mathcal{GT}_{n}$ when $m = n$. Among others, we show that this algebra is commutative, Noetherian, reduced, Koszul, and Cohen--Macaulay. We provide a complete classification of its maximal ideals and compute the topology of its maximal spectrum. Furthermore, we classify its irreducible modules and provide a faithful semisimple representation. We also establish that its associated variety coincides with a toric degeneration of certain partial flag varieties constructed by Gonciulea--Lakshmibai. As an application, we show that this algebra yields injective embeddings of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-crystals, extending a result of Bossinger--Torres.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the higher divisorial ideal $D(I):= Ann(Ext^g_R(R/I,R))$ associated to an ideal I of grade g. Our main focus is the containment problem $D(I) \subseteq \overline{I}$.
  We show that this inclusion holds for broad classes of ideals, including unmixed ideals of finite projective dimension over $3$-dimensional quasi-normal rings, parameter ideals in quasi-Gorenstein rings, and powers of perfect ideals under suitable homological conditions. Conversely, we construct explicit examples demonstrating the necessity of these hypotheses. We develop structural properties of D(I), relating it to unmixed parts, reflexive closures, symbolic powers, Frobenius closure, and trace ideals. Applications include criteria for the triviality of reflexive modules and vector bundles on punctured spectra, as well as new connections among annihilators of Ext, conductor ideals, and local cohomology.</description>

      <title>The Ideal Membership Problem and Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given polynomials $f_0,\dots, f_k$ the Ideal Membership Problem, IMP for short, asks if $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1,\dots, f_k$. In the search version of this problem the task is to find a proof of this fact. The IMP is a well-known fundamental problem with numerous applications. For instance, it underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as Nullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. Although the IMP is in general intractable, in many important cases it can be efficiently solved.
  Mastrolilli [SODA'19] initiated a systematic study of IMPs for ideals arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), parameterized by constraint languages, denoted IMP($\Gamma$). The ultimate goal of this line of research is to classify all such IMPs accordingly to their complexity. Mastrolilli achieved this goal for IMPs arising from CSP($\Gamma$) where $\Gamma$ is a Boolean constraint language, while Bulatov and Rafiey [STOC'22] advanced these results to several cases of CSPs over finite domains. In this paper we consider IMPs arising from CSPs over `affine' constraint languages, in which constraints are subgroups (or their cosets) of direct products of Abelian groups. This kind of CSPs include systems of linear equations and are considered one of the most important types of tractable CSPs. Some special cases of the problem have been considered before by Bharathi and Mastrolilli [MFCS'21] for linear equation modulo 2, and by Bulatov and Rafiey [STOC'22] to systems of linear equations over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime. Here we prove that if $\Gamma$ is an affine constraint language then IMP($\Gamma$) is solvable in polynomial time assuming the input polynomial has bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Stable sheaf cohomology on flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an effective stabilization result for the sheaf cohomology groups of line bundles on flag varieties parametrizing complete flags in k^n, as well as for the sheaf cohomology groups of polynomial functors applied to the cotangent sheaf Omega on projective space. In characteristic zero, these are natural consequences of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, but in characteristic p&gt;0 they are non-trivial. Unlike many important contexts in modular representation theory, where the prime characteristic p is assumed to be large relative to n, in our study we fix p and let n go to infinity. We illustrate the general theory by providing explicit stable cohomology calculations in a number of cases of interest. Our examples yield cohomology groups where the number of indecomposable summands has super-polynomial growth, and also show that the cohomological degrees where non-vanishing occurs do not form a connected interval. In the case of polynomial functors of Omega, we prove a Kunneth formula for stable cohomology, and show the invariance of stable cohomology under Frobenius, which combined with the Steinberg tensor product theorem yields calculations of stable cohomology for an interesting class of simple polynomial functors arising in the work of Doty. The results in the special case of symmetric powers of Omega provide a nice application to commutative algebra, yielding a sharp vanishing result for Koszul modules of finite length in all characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Assuming G\"odel's axiom of constructibility $V=L$, we construct a $\chi$-free abelian group $G$ of singular cardinality for some suitable cardinal $\chi$ which is regular and uncountable, equipped with the property that for every nontrivial subgroup $G' \subseteq G$ of smaller cardinality, $Hom(G',\mathbb{Z}) \neq 0$, while $Hom(G,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This provides a consistent counterexample to the singular compactness of nontrivial duality with respect to the functor $Hom(-,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>A monotonicity conjecture for the local maximal singularity of the Hilbert scheme of points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino conjecture predicts the maximum singularity of the Hilbert scheme of a tetrahedral number of points. As for the maximal singularities of the Hilbert scheme of a non-tetrahedral number of points, the second named author gave some separate conjectural necessary and sufficient conditions. In this paper, we provide a conjectural sufficient condition for the necessary condition, and propose a monotonicity conjecture which predicts that for a fixed colength $l$, the maximal dimension of the tangent space over all the Borel-fixed ideals of colength $l$ is increasing with respect to the smallest pure exponent of the ideal.</description>

Abstract: We prove two results, generalizing certain theorems by Jin and Moosa, on the internality of the system of differential equations \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned} x' &amp;= f(x)\\ y' &amp;= g(x)y,\\ \end{aligned} \end{equation*}where $f$ and $g$ are rational functions in one variable.</description>

      <title>Differential graded algebras with divided powers and homotopy Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $A$ and a quotient $A$-algebra $A/I$, we construct a resolution of $A/I$ as an $A$-module such that it is also a differential graded (dg) algebra with divided powers (PD). This construction makes use of symmetric tensors in the symmetric tensor category of dg $A$-modules and does not require a Noetherian assumption on $A$. Moreover, the resolution has many lifting properties which we leverage to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to the pair $(A,A/I)$, which is defined as the cohomology of the PD derivations of this PD dg algebra. Finally we investigate the complete intersection case in more details as well as connect it to the finite generation of the Yoneda algebra.</description>
