      <title>The gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor of conformally invariant theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor of up to fourth-order conformally invariant theories of gravity. Then we linearize the pseudo-tensor and use its average over a macroscopic region to find the energy and momentum carried by the plane gravitational waves of the three main conformally invariant theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>The scalar-torsion gravity corrections in the first-order inflationary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the corrections to the cosmological models based on the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity induced by the non-minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion. To determine these corrections, we consider a power-law parametrization of the deviations between the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and the scalar-torsion gravity. The estimates of the possible influence of the non-minimal coupling of the scalar field and torsion on the background cosmological parameters and the parameters of cosmological perturbations for the inflationary models implying linear relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index of the scalar perturbations are obtained. A procedure for verifying these inflationary models based on observational constraints on the values of cosmological perturbation parameters is also considered.</description>

      <title>Black hole event horizons are cosmologically coupled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that an exactly static black hole event horizon cannot be embedded in a time-dependent geometry. Forcing it to do so results in a naked null singularity at the would-be horizon. Therefore, since the universe is expanding, black holes must couple to the cosmological expansion, which was suggested as the growth mechanism for supermassive black holes in galaxies, with implications for the dark energy puzzle.</description>

      <title>Exponential correction to Friedmann equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, employing the exponential corrected entropy (Chatterjee and Ghosh in Phys Rev Lett 125:041302, 2020), we derive the modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics at apparent horizon and Verlinde's entropic gravity scenario. First, we derive the modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics. We investigate the validity of generalised second law (GSL) of thermodynamics and find that it is always satisfied for the all eras of universe. Moreover, we investigate the deceleration parameter for the case $k=0$ in two frameworks. Finally, we numerically study the bouncing behaviour for the modified Friedmann equations obtained from entropic gravity. The results indicate that the bouncing behaviour is possible for the cases $k=1$ and $k=-1$.</description>

      <title>Effects of the non-canonical dynamics in a high-dimensional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revisiting Einstein's gravitational theory, we build a five-dimensional braneworld. Within this framework, one announces the appearance of symmetric and asymmetric domain walls. Furthermore, it examines the emergent four-dimensional gravity from a theory with non-canonical dynamics. Exploring the physical and mathematical aspects, e.g., brane's energy density and the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum, one verifies that brane splitting is absent in the canonical and non-canonical theories. Additionally, we note the localization of the four-dimensional fluctuation projection on the 3-branes, which ensures the theory's stability. Thereby, one can conclude that the behavior of gravitational perturbations of the domain wall maintains a profile similar to a stable and non-localizable tower of massive modes. In contrast, within the brane core, the matter sector generates new barriers and potential wells, resulting in massive modes with approximately symmetric amplitudes. However, the non-canonical dynamics generate massive modes with asymmetric amplitudes far from the 3-brane.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on generic models of non-minimal curvature-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of non-minimally coupled curvature-matter models in the FLRW universe with a perfect fluid and analyze their cosmological implications using Supernova Ia, Observed Hubble Data, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements. Non-minimal coupling is introduced via an additional term $\int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \mathcal{G}({\cal L}_{m}) f_2(R)$ in the Einstein-Hilbert action. To obtain observational constraints, we use an exponential-type fluid-pressure profile $p = p_0e^{ak}$ characterized by the dimensionless parameter $k$ and parameterize $f_2(R)$ as $R^n$ with another dimensionless parameter $n$. Two additional parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the functional form of $\mathcal{G}({\cal L}_{m})$ determine the coupling strength. We identify significant regions in the $(n, k)$-parameter space for fixed coupling strength values where non-minimally coupled models align with observed late-time cosmic evolution. Additionally, we explore and discuss features of energy transfer between the curvature and matter sectors using observational data.</description>

      <title>Observational and theoretical aspects of Superspinars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article delves into the observational signatures and theoretical underpinnings of rotating astrophysical objects, with a particular focus on superspinars -exotic objects characterized by preventing the formation of event horizons due to their high angular momentum.
  While solutions within General Relativity (Kerr superspinars) predict such objects, their classical forms harbor naked singularities, violate causality, and exhibit problematic repulsive gravitational effects. These characteristics render classical superspinars theoretically objectionable, leading to the consideration of them as physically implausible. On the other hand, the incompatibility between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics suggests the exploration of alternative models, particularly those in which Quantum Gravity dominates the core, yielding regular superspinars.
  This work demonstrates that regular superspinars avoid all the complications associated with Kerr superspinars. From a phenomenological standpoint, it is shown that the silhouettes of regular superspinars are markedly distinct from those of black holes and classical Kerr superspinars. To substantiate these differences, we perform a comprehensive analysis of inner null geodesics and investigate the structure of the Planckian region within regular superspinars. Our study reveals that only regular superspinars provide the potential for distant observers to directly observe the extremely high curvature regions within their interiors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational tensor and scalar modes in $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational waves generated in $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity, i.e., a theory of gravity described by a non-metric compatible connection, free of torsion and curvature. It is an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity, equipped with a boundary term $B$. This theory exhibits gravitational waves regardless of the gauge adopted: they are the standard massless tensors plus a massive scalar gravitational wave like in the case of $f(R)$ gravity. It is precisely the boundary term $B$ that generates the massive scalar mode with an effective mass $m_{B}$ associated to a Klein-Gordon equation in the linearized boundary term. As in $f(Q)$ gravity also in $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity, a free test particle follows a geodesic motion due to the covariant conservation with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of the energy and momentum densities on shell. Therefore, in $f(Q,B)$ gravity, the proper acceleration between two neighboring worldlines traveled by two free point-like particle is governed by a first-order geodesic deviation equation in the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$. Thanks to this approximate linear equation, $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity shows three polarization modes: two massless transverse tensor radiation modes, with helicity equal to 2, reproducing the standard plus and cross modes, exactly as in General Relativity, and an additional massive scalar wave mode with transverse polarization of zero helicity. We obtain the same result both by considering the coincidence gauge and by leaving the gauge free. In summary, three degrees of freedom propagate in the $f(Q,B)$ linearized theory with amplitudes $\tilde{h}^{(+)}$ and $\tilde{h}^{(\times)}$ for tensor modes and amplitude $\tilde{h}^{(s)}$ for the scalar mode. Specifically, both $f(Q,B)$ and $f(R)$ gravity involve the same massive transverse scalar perturbation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of gravitational radiation generated by type D black holes with positive cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The criterion for existence of gravitational radiation at conformal infinity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant is applied to a general family of exact solutions representing generic (pairs of) black holes of algebraic type D. Our analysis shows that only accelerating black holes generate gravitational radiation measurable at infinity. This very satisfactory result confirms the goodness of the criterion. To that end, a new metric form of the family of exact type D black holes is constructed -- including any cosmological constant and a (double-aligned) non-null electromagnetic field -- whose expression is suitable for investigation of the asymptotic structure of this large family of spacetimes. The family depends on seven physical parameters, namely $m$, $a$, $l$, $\alpha$, $e$, $g$, and $\Lambda$ that characterize mass, specific angular momentum parameter, NUT parameter, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and the cosmological constant, respectively.</description>

      <title>Background gravitational waves as signature of the adiabatic expansion of a black body that represents the dark universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a toy model of a spherical universe made up of an exotic dark gas with temperature $T$ in thermal equilibrium with a black-body in adiabatic expansion. Each particle of this exotic gas mimics a kind of particle of dark energy represented by the vacuum energy, being quantized into virtual particles with extremely small masses that form such gas representng the own tissue of the expanding space-time governed by a negative pressure whose origin is the equation of state (EOS) of vacuum, i.e., $p=-\rho$, where $\rho$ is the vacuum energy density. So, each vacuum particle occupies a tiny area of space so-called Planck area $L_p^{2}$, which represents the minimum area of the whole space-time given by the spherical surface with area $4\pi R_H^2$, where $R_H$ is the Hubble radius. We realize that such spherical surface is the surface of the black-body for representing the dark universe as if it were the surface of an expanding balloon. Thus, we are able to derive the law of universal gravitation, thus leading us to understand the cosmological anti-gravity. We estimate the very small order of magnitude of the cosmological constant and the acceleration of expansion of the dark sphere. In this toy model, as the dark universe can be thought of as a large black body, when we obtain its power and frequency of emission of radiation, we find very low values. We conclude that such radiation and frequency of the black body made up of dark energy is a background gravitational wave with very low frequency in the order of $10^{-17}$Hz due to the slight stretching of the fabric of space-time.</description>

      <title>News tensor on null hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric definition of news tensor on null hypersurfaces in four space-time dimensions is presented. When the conformal Einstein field equations hold, this news tensor yields the correct expression for the radiative components of the rescaled Weyl tensor at infinity with vanishing cosmological constant in arbitrary conformal gauge. Also, a generalised transport equation for the Geroch tensor is derived. Important differences between null hypersurfaces in the bulk of the space-time and null infinity with vanishing cosmological constant are reviewed, and their impact on the role of the news is discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergent electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of emergent electric field. This is distinguished from the fundamental one in that the emergent electric field directly appears in observations through the Lorentz force, while the latter enters the phase space as the canonical momentum of the electromagnetic field. In Hamiltonian classical electromagnetism this concept naturally appears after introducing the topological $\theta$ term. Furthermore, we show that in the spherically symmetric model the concept of emergent electric field allows us to formulate a modified theory of electromagnetism that is otherwise impossible. The relation between the fundamental and the emergent electric fields is derived from the imposition of general covariance of the electromagnetic strength tensor, which is a nontrivial task in the canonical formulation the modified theory is based on. We couple this theory to emergent modified gravity, where a similar distinction between spacetime and gravity is made such that the spacetime, which defines the observable geometry, is an emergent field composed of the fundamental gravitational field. In this more encompassing emergent field theory coupling gravity and electromagnetism, we show that the spherically symmetric model contains a nonsingular black hole solution where not only modified gravity but also modified electromagnetism is crucial for a robust singularity resolution and to avoid the existence of (super)extermal black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$-gravity allows for the presence of a perfect fluid with a tilted velocity in the Kantowski-Sachs geometry. In this dipole model, we consider an ideal gas and we investigate the evolution of the physical parameters. The tilt parameter is constrained by the nonlinear function $f(Q)$ through the non-diagonal equations of the field equations. We find that the dynamics always reduce to the vacuum solutions of STEGR. This includes the Kasner universe, when no cosmological term is introduced by the $f(Q)$ function, and the isotropic de Sitter universe, where $f\left( Q\right) $ plays the role of the cosmological constant. In the extreme tilt limit, the universe is consistently anisotropic and accelerated. However, the final solution matches that of STEGR.</description>

      <title>Bridging Dark Energy and Black Holes with EFT: Frame Transformation and Gravitational Wave Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, constraints on parameters of the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy have been obtained in the Jordan frame, where matter fields are minimally coupled to gravity. To connect these constraints with those of the EFT of black hole perturbations with a timelike scalar profile, it is necessary to perform a frame transformation on the EFT in general. In this paper, we study the conformal/disformal transformation of EFT parameters on an arbitrary background. Furthermore, we explore the effect of an EFT operator $M_6(r) \bar{\sigma}^{\mu}_{\nu} \delta K^{\nu}_{\alpha} \delta K^{\alpha}_{\mu}$, which is elusive to the LIGO/Virgo bound on gravitational-wave speed, on the dynamics of odd-parity black hole perturbations. Intriguingly, a deviation from luminal propagation shows up only in the vicinity of the black hole, and the speeds of perturbations in the radial and angular directions are different in general due to the traceless part $\bar{\sigma}^\mu_\nu$ of the background extrinsic curvature. This study establishes an important link between cosmological constraints and those obtained in the black hole regime.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bounce Scenario with a Novel Parametrization of Bulk Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied how incorporating viscous fluids leads to exact bounce cosmological solutions in general relativity (GR) framework. Specifically, we propose a novel parameterization of bulk viscosity coefficient of the form $\zeta = \zeta_0 (t-t_0)^{-2n} H$, where $\zeta_0$, $n$ being some positive constants and $t_0$ is the bounce epoch. We investigate how this form of bulk viscosity may assist in explaining the early universe's behaviour, with a particular focus on non-singular bounce scenario by studying the various energy conditions and other related cosmological observables and how the model parameters affect the evolution of the Universe. We demonstrate that the NEC and SEC violation occurs at the bounce point while DEC is satisfied. Finally, we carried out a stability check based on linear order perturbation to the Hubble parameter. We found that the perturbation vanishes asymptotically at later times, which indicates a stable behaviour of the bounce scenario</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of fermion localization within the framework of $f(T, B)$ gravity featuring non-minimal couplings. Starting from the Dirac action for a spin-$1/2$ fermion in a five-dimensional spacetime governed by torsional $f(T, B)$ gravity, we derive the Dirac equation and we explore its solutions under various non-minimal coupling functions. We examine two realistic forms of the torsional non-minimal coupling and reveal distinct behaviors that impact the localization of both massless and massive fermionic modes on the brane. Additionally, we employ probabilistic measurements, including Shannon entropy theory, Fisher information theory, and relative probability, to analyze the localization of these fermionic modes. The observed effects offer potential insights into probing torsional modifications.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of quasinormal modes of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15191</link>

Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at avoided crossing near exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics inconsistencies in cosmological unimodular gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the thermodynamics of a cosmological unimodular gravity model at late times by considering two different energy diffusion functions that emerges in these scenarios, and that encodes the current for the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, usually termed as $Q(t)$. Specifically, we discuss the barotropic and the continuous spontaneous localization models as energy diffusion functions. The consistency conditions demanded for the entropy of the system in terms of the cosmological parameters of the model: positive production ($dS/dt&gt;0$) and convexity condition ($d^{2}S/dt^{2} &lt;0$), are investigated. We show that these conditions strongly constraint the viavility of these models. Additionally, we comment about our results and compare with those obtained in recent works where the restriction of the parameters for these two diffusion models was implemented with the use of cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Information Dynamics: The Landauer Principle and Cosmological Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the information loss at the cosmological apparent horizon in an expanding universe has a direct correspondence with the Landauer principle of information dynamics. We show that the Landauer limit is satisfied in this case, which implies that the information erasure at the cosmological apparent horizon happens in the most efficient way possible. We also show that our results hold for extensions of the standard entropy formulations. This is the first work which directly provides a correspondence between information dynamics and expanding cosmic horizons, and we discuss several interesting implications of this result.</description>

      <title>Kerr--Newman Memory Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bring the Kerr--Newman spacetime into the Bondi--Sachs gauge by means of zero angular momentum, null geodesics. We compute the memory effect produced at the black hole horizon by a transient gravitational shock wave, which from future null infinity is seen as a Bondi-Metzner-Sachs supertranslation. This results in a change of the supertransformation charges at infinity between the spacetime geometries defined by the black hole before, and after, the shockwave scattering. For an extremal Kerr--Newman black hole, we give the complementary description of this process in the near-horizon limit, as seen by an observer hovering over the horizon. In this limit, we compute the supertranformation charges and compare them to those calculated at null infinity. We analyze the effect of these transformations on the electromagnetic gauge field and explore the self-interaction between this and the angular momentum of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction through Comisso-Asenjo process from a Kerr-Newman black hole in perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, a novel mechanism recently proposed by Comisso and Asenjo, for a Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Our studies focus on the impact of black hole spin $a$, electric charge $Q$ and PFDM parameter $\lambda$ on the horizons, ecoregions and circular geodesics at the equatorial plane of this black hole, and how they further influence the reconnection efficiency and energy extraction rate. Our results show that the size of ergoregion does not vary monotonically with increasing dark matter parameters $\lambda$, but it can significantly increase at faster spins ($a&gt;0.8$) as the dark matter parameter $\lambda$ decreases, given the electric charge stays within $Q\in [0.2,0.5]$. We identify the optimal conditions for the combination of $a$, $Q$ and $\lambda$ that enable efficient energy extraction even when the black hole is not rapidly spinning. The Kerr-Newman black hole in PFDM allows for achieving high energy extraction rates comparable to those of most previously studied rotating black holes, which typically require near-extremal spin to reach similar efficiency levels.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on FLRW, Bianchi type I and V brane models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the compatibility of Covariant Extrinsic Gravity (CEG) with current cosmological observations. We employ the chi-square statistic and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the FLRW and Bianchi type-I and V brane models to the latest datasets, including Hubble, Pantheon+ Supernova samples, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the structure growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z)$. Parameters for FLRW universe consist $\left(\Omega^{\text{(b)}}_0, \Omega^{\text{(cd)}}_0, \Omega^{\text{(k)}}_0, H_0, \gamma, \sigma_8\right)$, while for the Bianchi model are $\left(\Omega^{\text{(b)}}_0, \Omega^{\text{(cd)}}_0, \Omega^{{(\beta)}}_0, H_0, \gamma, \Omega^{(\theta)}_0, \sigma_8\right)$. We determine the best values for cosmological parameters. For the FLRW model, these values depend on the sign of $\gamma$: $\gamma &gt; 0$ yields $\gamma =0.00008^{+0.00015}_{-0.00011}$, and $\Omega^{\text{(k)}}_0=0.014^{+0.024}_{-0.022}$ and $\gamma &lt; 0$ leads to $\gamma =-0.0226^{+0.0054}_{-0.0062}$, and $\Omega^{\text{(k)}}_0=0.023^{+0.039}_{-0.041}$. In both cases $\Omega^{\text{(k)}}_0&gt;0$ represents a closed universe. Similarly, for the Bianchi type-V brane model, the parameter values vary with the sign of $\gamma$, resulting in $\gamma = 0.00084^{+0.00019}_{-0.00021}$, $\Omega^{(\beta)}_0 =0.0258^{+0.0052}_{-0.0063} $, and $\Omega^{\theta}_0(\times 10^{-5} ) = 4.19^{+0.67}_{-0.75}$ (as with the density parameter of stiff matter) for $\gamma &gt; 0$, and $\gamma = -0.00107^{+0.00019}_{-0.00020}$, $\Omega^{(\beta)}_0 = 0.0259^{+0.0050}_{-0.0062} $, and $\Omega^{\theta}_0(\times 10^{-5} ) = 4.17^{+0.91}_{-0.98}$ for $\gamma &lt; 0$. In both cases $\Omega^{(\beta)}_0&gt;0$, which represents the Bianchi type-V, because in the Bianchi type-I, $\beta=0$. Utilizing these obtained best values, we analyze the behavior of key cosmological parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an inference method for determining neutron star parameters and constraining the nuclear equation of state (EOS) using the RIFT parameter inference engine. We incorporate externally-produced prior information about the EOS to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the inference process. We apply this method to the GW170817 event and assess its performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating prior EOS information in the inference process, leading to sharper conclusions and more rapid inference on new detections. This approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of neutron stars and the nuclear EOS in future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Coupled phantom cosmological model motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a coupled phantom dark-energy cosmological model in which the coupling term between a phantom scalar field with an exponential potential and a pressureless dark-matter fluid is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm. Using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems, complemented by numerical solutions of the evolution equations, we study the late-time behavior of our model. We show that contrary to the uncoupled scenario, the coupled phantom model admits accelerated scaling solutions. However, they do not correspond to a final state of the universe's evolution and, therefore, cannot be used to solve the cosmological coincidence problem. Furthermore, we show that, for certain coupling parameter values, the total equation-of-state parameter's asymptotic behavior is significantly changed when compared to the uncoupled scenario, allowing for solutions less phantom even for steeper potentials of the phantom scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the decoherence of a spatially superposed electrically neutral spin-$\frac12$ particle in the presence of a relativistic quantum electromagnetic field in Minkowski spacetime. We demonstrate that decoherence due to the spin-magnetic field coupling can be categorized into two distinct factors: local decoherence, originating from the two-point correlation functions along each branch of the superposed trajectories, and nonlocal decoherence, which arises from the correlation functions between the two superposed trajectories. These effects are linked to phase damping and amplitude damping. We also show that if the quantum field is prepared in a thermal state, decoherence monotonically increases with the field temperature.</description>

      <title>Spoofing Entanglement in Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A defining property of Hawking radiation is that states with very low entanglement masquerade as highly mixed states; this property is captured by a quantum computational phenomenon known as spoofing entanglement. Motivated by the potential implications for black hole information and the emergence of spacetime connectivity, as well as possible applications of spoofing entanglement, we investigate the geometrization of two types of entanglement spoofers in AdS/CFT: so-called EFI pairs and pseudoentangled state ensembles. We show that (a strengthened version of) EFI pairs with a semiclassical bulk dual have a Python's Lunch; the maximally mixed state over the pseudoentangled state ensemble likewise features a Python's Lunch. Since a Python's Lunch must lie behind an event horizon, we find that black holes are the exclusive gravitational source of entanglement spoofing in the semiclassical limit. Finally, we use an extant construction of holographic pseudorandom states to yield a candidate example of a pseudoentangled state ensemble with a semiclassical bulk dual.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Duet by Resonating Binary Black Holes with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We leverage gravitational wave observations to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on axion-like particles (ALPs). This study investigates the resonant effects of ALPs with binary black hole systems, where their oscillatory nature induces time-dependent forces on the black holes. By employing a detailed Fisher matrix analysis, we not only probe a new parameter space for ALPs, characterized by their mass and decay constants, but also assess how these parameters affect gravitational waveforms during black hole mergers. Our approach is distinct as it does not assume interactions of ALPs with photons or nucleons. We demonstrate that as binary black holes spiral inward and lose energy, their orbital frequencies may resonate with those of ALPs, producing distinct oscillatory patterns in gravitational waves detectable by upcoming experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). This work broadens the potential of gravitational wave astronomy as a tool for dark matter searches, offering a promising avenue for studying elusive components of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-wavelength polarized light signals from supermassive black holes have sparked a range of studies on polarized images of accretion disks and hotspots. However, the polarization patterns within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) region remain to be explored. In this study, we focus on two specific types of orbits, namely the plunging geodesics inward from the ISCO and homoclinic geodesics, to uncover the polarization features associated with non-circular motion in a Kerr spacetime. For an on-axis observer, we specifically develop an approximate function to describe gravitational lensing along the azimuthal direction, and establish a simplified synchrotron emission model. Based on these, we analyze the polarized patterns of hotspots accumulated over time and their Stokes parameters. Moreover, we explore the polarized image of the plunging region within a thin accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Constraints on interacting dark energy models from the DESI BAO and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent results from the first year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full five-year observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM for the IDE model with $Q=\beta H_0\rho_{\rm de}$ reaches the $3\sigma$ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with $Q\propto\rho_{\rm c}$, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient $\Gamma$. The IDE model with $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ yields $\beta=0.0003\pm 0.0011$, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have played a significant role in understanding the nature of dark energy. In this article, we investigate the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state, utilizing high-precision CMB data from multiple experiments. We begin by examining the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, a commonly used and recognized framework for describing the dark energy equation of state. We then explore the general Exponential parametrization, which incorporates CPL as its first-order approximation, and extensions of this parametrization that incorporate nonlinear terms. We constrain these scenarios using CMB data from various missions, including the Planck 2018 legacy release, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT), as well as combinations with low-redshift cosmological probes such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Pantheon sample. While the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology remains consistent within the 68\% confidence level, we observe that the extensions of the CPL parametrization are indistinguishable for Planck data. However, for ACT and SPT data, the inclusion of additional terms begins to reveal a peak in $w_{\rm a, DE}$ that was previously unconstrained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have enabled direct detections of compact binary coalescences (CBCs). However, their poor sky localisation and the typical lack of observable electromagnetic (EM) counterparts make it difficult to confidently identify their hosts, and study the environments that nurture their evolution. In this work, we show that $\textit{detailed}$ information of the host environment (e.g. the mass and steepness of the host potential) can be directly inferred by measuring the kinematic parameters (acceleration and its time-derivatives) of the binary's center of mass using GWs alone, without requiring an EM counterpart. We consider CBCs in various realistic environments such as globular clusters, nuclear star clusters, and active galactic nuclei disks to demonstrate how orbit and environment parameters can be extracted for CBCs detectable by ground- and space-based observatories, including the LIGO detector at A+ sensitivity, Einstein Telescope of the XG network, LISA, and DECIGO, $\textit{on a single-event basis}$. These constraints on host stellar environments promise to shed light on our understanding of how CBCs form, evolve, and merge.</description>

Abstract: We study integrability and non-integrability of non-SUSY quivers in 4d that are dual to marginal deformations of Gaiotto-Maldacena geometry in 10d. We explore the dual operator spectrum and the fate of Liouvillian non-integrability both in the presence and the absence of the flavour degrees of freedom. We also comment about the factorised scattering and the associated integrability or non-integrability of the sigma model. Our analysis reveals the mutual compatibility between two seemingly different approaches that has existed in the literature for a long time.</description>

      <title>Probing the shape of the primordial curvature power spectrum and the energy scale of reheating with pulsar timing arrays</title>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) provides a unique opportunity to probe the early Universe, potentially encoding information about the primordial curvature power spectrum and the energy scale of reheating. Recent observations by collaborations such as NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, and CPTA have detected a stochastic common-spectrum signal, which may originate from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by primordial curvature perturbations during inflation. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that the NANOGrav signal is sourced by SIGWs and aim to constrain the shape of the primordial curvature power spectrum and the reheating energy scale using the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We model the primordial curvature power spectrum with a lognormal form and focus on the case where the equation of state during reheating is $w=1/6$, corresponding to an inflaton potential $V(\phi) \sim \phi^{14/5}$. Employing Bayesian inference, we obtain posterior distributions for the lognormal power spectrum parameters and the reheating temperature. Our results indicate a narrow peak in the primordial power spectrum ($\Delta &lt; 0.001$ at 90\% confidence) and a lower bound on the reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh} \geq 0.1 {\rm GeV}$), consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints. The best-fit SIGW energy density spectrum exhibits a distinct turning point around $f \sim 10^{-8.1}\,{\rm Hz}$, corresponding to the transition from reheating to the radiation-dominated era. This feature, combined with the sharp high-frequency decrease due to the narrow primordial power spectrum peak, offers a unique signature for probing early Universe properties.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dark energy on weighing neutrinos after DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>A fast frequency-domain expression for the time-dependent detector response of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors to compact binary signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For proposed third-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, whose sensitive bands are proposed to extend down to 5 Hz or below, the signals of low-mass compact binaries such as binary neutron stars remain in the detector's sensitive band long enough (up to a few days for the smallest proposed low-frequency cutoff of 1 Hz) that one cannot neglect the effects of the Earth's rotation on the detector's response and the changing Doppler shift of the signal. In the latter case, one also needs to consider the effects of the Earth's orbital motion, which is currently only included in analyses of compact binary signals using continuous wave techniques. These effects are also relevant for current detectors and signals from putative subsolar-mass binaries. Here we present simple Fourier series methods for computing these effects in the frequency domain, giving explicit expressions for the Earth's orbital motion in terms of low-order Fourier series, which will be sufficiently accurate for all compact binary signals except for those from very low-mass subsolar-mass binaries. The expression for the effects of the Earth's rotation on the antenna pattern functions does not use the stationary phase approximation (SPA), so we are able to show that the SPA is indeed quite accurate in these situations and present a Fourier series expression equivalent to it which is an order of magnitude faster. We also provide illustrations of these effects on detector sensitivity and the accumulation of information about various binary parameters with frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the initial clustering of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) beyond a Poisson distribution can efficiently enhance the matter power spectrum, and thus the halo mass function. As a result, the population of initially clustered SMPBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^9M_\odot$ and the fraction of energy density $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-3}$ (consistent with current constraints on SMPBHs) has the potential to naturally explain high-redshift massive galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled gravity as a physically viable fit to DESI 2024 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the DESI collaboration have presented an indication for dynamical dark energy, when adopting the $(w_0,w_a)$ parametrization of the equation of state. The associated posterior constraints imply a crossing of the phantom divide. The latter, however, has profound theoretical implications because not all models can do so without developing incurable instabilities. Simple quintessence models of dark energy, for instance, would be ruled out if such a crossing is confirmed. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the equation of state, and confirm that crossing of the phantom divide is required by the DESI BAO data. We then explore the theory space of Horndeski gravity employing a reconstruction method based on the effective field theory of dark energy, and show that for most of the models it is still difficult to safely cross the divide. We identify non-minimal coupling to gravity as the key modification which sustains a stable phantom crossing in the general Horndeski theory space and fits DESI observations. Guided by these insights, we propose the \textit{Thawing Gravity} model which has the same number of parameters as $w_0w_a$CDM and naturally realizes non-minimal coupling when dark energy becomes non-negligible. \textit{Thawing Gravity} improves the fit over $\Lambda$CDM for DESI BAO, CMB as well as type Ia Supernovae.</description>

      <title>I-Love-Q anisotropically: Universal relations for compact stars with scalar pressure anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:1503.02726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain physical quantities that characterize neutron stars and quark stars (e.g. their mass, spin angular momentum and quadrupole moment) are interrelated in a way that is approximately insensitive to their internal structure. Such approximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data analysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although the pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain scenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase transitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the approximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future observations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and tidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third order in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only weakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to the isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in explaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity variation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the emergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality. Anisotropy does not affect the universal relations to a sufficient level to prevent their use in gravitational wave astrophysics or in experimental relativity. We provide an explicit example of the latter in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. The increase in variability of the universal relations due to pressure anisotropy could affect their use in future X-ray observations. Given expected observational uncertainties, however, the relations remain sufficiently universal for use in such observations if the anisotropic modifications to the moment of inertia and the quadrupole moment are less than 10% of their isotropic values.</description>

Abstract: This work is focused on the exploration of the thermodynamics foundations of the matter creation scenario when a generalized form of the second law of thermodynamics for this scheme is implemented. In this scenario we consider an expanding cosmology in which the created matter is trapped by the apparent horizon. The scheme leads to phantom evolution but at first glance it lacks of physical consistency. However, the inclusion of chemical potential into the description solves the thermodynamics issues of the model and determines the behavior of the cosmic fluid, in other words, the cosmic fluid now can behave as phantom dark energy or as quintessence one.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the possibility of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solution within the context of the Maxwell-Weyl gauge theory of gravity. To achieve this, we utilize the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory as an analogy and represent the Maxwell gauge field in terms of two time-dependent scalar fields. We derive the modified Friedmann equations, integrating the contributions from the Maxwell gauge fields and an effective cosmological constant that depends on the Dirac scalar field. Our analysis reveals how these modifications influence various cosmological scenarios, including power-law evolution, de Sitter-like expansion, inflationary phases, non-singular bounce cosmologies, and cyclic cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Black-hole spectroscopy: quasinormal modes, ringdown stability and the pseudospectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16227v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the Kerr nature of astrophysical compact objects and their environment. The observation of multiple ringdown modes in gravitational waveforms could soon lead to high-precision gravitational-wave spectroscopy, thus it is critical to understand if the quasinormal mode spectrum itself is affected by astrophysical environments, quantum corrections, and other generic modifications. In this chapter, we will review the black-hole spectroscopy program and its challenges regarding quasinormal mode detection, the overtone status and the recent evidence that supports the existence of nonlinearities in the spectrum of black holes. We will then discuss a newly introduced non-modal tool in black-hole physics, namely the pseudospectrum; a mathematical notion that can shed light on the spectral stability of quasinormal modes, and discuss its novel applications in black holes and exotic horizonless compact objects. We will show that quasinormal modes generically suffer from spectral instabilities, explore how such phenomena can further affect black-hole spectroscopy, and discuss potential ringdown imprints and waveform stability issues in current and future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the free energy $\mathcal{F}$ and temperature $T$ of black holes, considered as a thermodynamic system, can be viewed as an $A$-discriminant of an appropriately-defined polynomial. As such, mathematical results about $A$-discriminants may lead to implications about black hole thermodynamics. In particular, for static spacetimes with spherical, planar, or hyperbolic symmetry, the number of distinct thermodynamic phases depend on the number of distinct terms in the metric component $g_{tt}$. We prove that if $g_{tt}$ consists of $N_f$ distinct terms, then the $\mathcal{F}$-$T$ curve consists of $N_f-2$ cusps, which in turn leads to $N_f-1$ distinct thermodynamic phases. This result is applied to explicit examples of the Schwarzschild-AdS, Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m, power-law Maxwell, and Euler--Heisenberg black holes.</description>

      <title>Detecting the tidal heating with the generic extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15532v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The horizon of a classical black hole (BH), functioning as a one-way membrane, plays a vital role in the dynamic evolution of binary BHs, capable of absorbing fluxes entirely. Tidal heating, stemming from this phenomenon, exerts a notable influence on the production of gravitational waves(GWs). If at least one member of a binary is an exotic compact object (ECO) instead of a BH, the absorption of fluxes is expected to be incomplete and the tidal heating would be different. Thus, tidal heating can be utilized for model-independent investigations into the nature of compact object. In this paper, assuming that the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) contains a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive ECO with a reflective surface, we compute the GWs from the generic EMRI orbits. Using the accurate and analytic flux formulas in the black hole spacetime, we adapted these formulas in the vicinity of the ECO surface by incorporating a reflectivity parameter. Under the adiabatic approximation, we can evolve the orbital parameters and compute the EMRI waveforms. The effect of tidal heating for the spinning and non-spinning objects can be used to constrain the reflectivity of the surface at the level of 10^-6 by computing the mismatch and fisher information matrix.</description>

Abstract: We review notions of mass of asymptotically locally Anti-de Sitter three-dimensional spacetimes, and apply them to some known solutions. For two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets the mass is not invariant under asymptotic symmetries, but a unique mass parameter can be obtained either by minimisation, or by a monodromy construction, or both. We give an elementary proof of positivity, and of a Penrose-type inequality, in a natural gauge. We apply the "Maskit gluing construction" to time-symmetric asymptotically locally hyperbolic vacuum initial data sets and derive mass/entropy formulae for the resulting manifolds. Finally, we show that all mass aspect functions can be realised by constant scalar curvature metrics on complete manifolds which are smooth except for at most one conical singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in detail the weak-field gravitational lensing of a relativistic neutral massive particle induced by a regular black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole proposed by Simpson and Visser. Starting with the calculation of the gravitational deflection of the massive particle up to the third post-Minkowskian order, the Virbhadra-Ellis lens equation is solved perturbatively beyond the weak-deflection limit to achieve the expressions for the lensing observables of the primary and secondary images of a point-like particle source. The main observables contain not only the positions, the flux magnifications, and the gravitational time delays of the individual images, but also the positional relations, the magnification relations (including the total magnification), the magnification centroid, and the differential time delay. We then discuss the velocity-induced effects originated from the deviation of the particle's initial velocity from the speed of light on the black-bounce-Schwarzschild lensing observables of the images of a point-like light source, and the effects induced by the bounce parameter of the spacetime on the measurable image properties of Schwarzschild lensing of the massive particle. As an application of the results, we model the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center (i.e., Sgr A$^{\ast}$) as the lens, and focus on evaluating the possibilities to detect the new velocity-induced and bounce-induced effects on the practical lensing observables and analyzing the dependence of these effects on the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar fields play an important role in constructing modified gravity theories. In the case of a single scalar field with timelike gradient, the corresponding Lagrangian in the unitary gauge takes the form of spatially covariant gravity (SCG), which is proved useful in analyzing and extending the generally covariant theories. In this work, we apply the SCG method to the scalar-nonmetricity theory, of which the Lagrangian is built of the nonmetricity tensor and a scalar field. We derive the 3+1 decomposition of the geometric quantities and especially covariant derivatives of the scalar field up to the third order in the presence of a nonvanishing nonmetricity tensor. By fixing the unitary gauge, the resulting Lagrangian takes the form of a SCG with nonmetricity, in which all the ingredients are spatial tensors. We then exhaust the scalar monomials of SCG with nonmetricity up to $d=3$ with $d$ the total number of derivatives. Since the disformation tensor plays as an auxiliary variable, we take the Lagrangian with $d=2$ as an example to show that after solving the disformation tensor, we can get an effective SCG theory for the metric variables but with modified coefficients. Our results provides a novel approach to extending the scalar-nonmetricity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations. In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and can act as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this "diffusion regime", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution. We compute modifications to the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find an anomalous contribution which corresponds to a cosmological constant, anti-correlated with a contribution which has been used to fit galactic rotation curves without dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a study of the equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic stars in the framework of general relativity. For that purpose, we provide the equations of structure where the rotation is treated to second order in the angular velocity. These equations extend those first derived by Hartle for slowly rotating isotropic stars. As an application of the new formalism, we study the rotational properties of Bowers-Liang fluid spheres. A result of particular interest is that the ellipticity and mass quadrupole moment are negative for certain highly anisotropic configurations; thus, such systems are prolate rather than oblate. Furthermore, for configurations with high anisotropy and compactness close to their critical value, quantities like the moment of inertia, change of mass, and mass quadrupole moment approach to the corresponding Kerr black hole values, similar to other ultracompact systems like sub-Buchdahl Schwarzschild stars and analytic rotating gravastars.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear treatment of a black hole mimicker ringdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first nonlinear and self-consistent study of the merger and ringdown of a black hole mimicking object with stable light rings. To that end, we numerically solve the full Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations governing the head-on collisions of a series of binary boson stars in the large-mass-ratio regime resulting in spinning horizonless remnants with stable light rings. We broadly confirm the appearance of features in the extracted gravitational waveforms expected based on perturbative methods: the signal from the prompt response of the remnants approaches that of a Kerr black hole in the large-compactness limit, and the subsequent emissions contain periodically appearing bursts akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes. However, these bursts occur at high frequencies and are sourced by perturbations of the remnant's internal degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the emitted waveforms also contain a large-amplitude and long-lived component comparable in frequency to black hole quasi-normal modes. We further characterize the emissions, obtain basic scaling relations of relevant timescales, and compute the energy emitted in gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Radiative Degrees of Freedom of Thomas-Whitehead Gravity</title>

Abstract: The geometric action of the semi-direct product of the Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras contains the WZW action equipped with a background vector potential $A$ associated to a coadjoint element of the Kac-Moody algebra as well as the 2D gravitational Polyakov action and an accompanying background field, $\mathcal{D}$, called the diffeomorphism field. Just as the coadjoint element, $A$, is related to a gauge fixed Yang-Mills vector potential $A_a$, the diffeomorphism field, $\mathcal{D}$, is related to a component, $\mathcal{D}_{a b}$ of the projectively invariant connection called the Thomas Operator. The Yang-Mills action provides dynamics for the vector potential $A_a,$ while the Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravitational action, provides dynamics to $\mathcal{D}_{ab}$. The TW action embeds the projectively invariant connection into a gravitational theory that contains general relativity. In this work, the diffeomorphism field $\mathcal{D}_{a b}$ is examined in Minkowski space where salient features of this field can be explored. In particular, we study the radiative degrees of freedom of this field while in a Minkowski space background. We show that it can be decomposed into irreducible representations, corresponding to tensor, vector, and scalar radiating solutions. Furthermore we examine geodesic deviation in the context of TW gravity about a Minkowski space background. We do this both at zeroth and first order in metric fluctuations $h_{ab}$. We discuss that response of a gravitational wave antennae to the geodesics deviations.</description>

      <title>Causal Sets and an Emerging Continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal set theory offers a simple and elegant picture of discrete physics. But the vast majority of causal sets look nothing at all like continuum spacetimes, and must be excluded in some way to obtain a realistic theory. I describe recent results showing that almost all non-manifoldlike causal sets are, in fact, very strongly suppressed in the gravitational path integral. This does not quite demonstrate the emergence of a continuum -- we do not yet understand the remaining unsuppressed causal sets well enough -- but it is a significant step in that direction.</description>

      <title>Shadows, Quasinormal Modes, and Optical Appearances of Black Holes in Horndeski Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work describes the motion of photons in black hole (BH) spacetimes within the framework of Horndeski theory. We focus on the shadows, quasinormal modes (QNMs) and optical appearances of BHs surrounded by geometrically thin accretion disks. The QNMs of BHs are calculated by the WKB method and the eikonal limit, respectively. Using Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of $\mathrm{M} 87^*$ and $\mathrm{Sgr} \mathrm{A}^*$, we can constrain the parameter in Horndeski theory to a small range. Based on the constraint, we obtain the frequency ranges of the fundamental modes for $\mathrm{M} 87^*$ and $\mathrm{Sgr} \mathrm{A}^*$ in Horndeski theory. By exploring the optical appearances of BHs, we find that for the current resolution of the EHT, it primarily captures direct emission. This work advances our understanding of the observational characteristics of BHs in Horndeski theory and constrains Horndeski theory by EHT observations of $\mathrm{M} 87^*$ and $\mathrm{Sgr} \mathrm{A}^*$.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group in homogeneous projective coordinates, because it is then possible to write all transformations of such a group in a manifestly linear way. The 2-sphere metric, Bondi-Metzner-Sachs metric, asymptotic Killing vectors, generators of supertranslations, as well as boosts and rotations of Minkowski spacetime, are all re-expressed in homogeneous projective coordinates. Last, the integral curves of vector fields which generate supertranslations are evaluated in detail. This work prepares the ground for more advanced applications of the differential geometry of asymptotically flat spacetimes in projective coordinates.</description>

      <title>A frame-bundle formulation of quantum reference frames: from superposition of perspectives to superposition of geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a possible fully geometric formulation of the core idea of quantum reference frames (QRFs) as it has been applied in the context of gravity, freeing its definition from unnecessary (though convenient) ingredients, such as coordinate systems. Our formulation is based on two main ideas. First, a QRF encodes uncertainty about what is the observer's (and, hence, the measuring apparatus's) perception of time and space at each spacetime point (i.e., event). For this, an observer at an event $p$ is modeled, as usual, as a tetrad in the tangent space $T_p$. So a QRF at an event $p$ is a complex function on the tetrads at $p$. Second, we use the result that one can specify a metric on a given manifold by stipulating that a basis one assigns at each tangent space is to be a tetrad in the metric one wants to specify. Hence a spacetime, i.e. manifold plus metric, together with a choice of "point of view" on it, is represented by a section of the bundle of bases, understood as taking the basis assigned to each point to be a tetrad. Thus a superposition of spacetimes gets represented as, roughly speaking, an assignment of complex amplitudes to sections of this bundle. A QRF, defined here as the collection of complex amplitudes assigned to bases at events--i.e., a complex function defined on the bundle of bases of the manifold--can describe, in a local way (i.e., attributing the amplitudes to bases at events instead of to whole sections), these superpositions.
  We believe that this formulation sheds some light on some conceptual aspects and possible extensions of current ideas about QRFs. For instance, thinking in geometric terms makes it clear that the idea of QRFs applied to the gravitational scenarios treated in the literature (beyond linear approximation) lacks predictive power due to arbitrariness which, we argue, can only be resolved by some further input from physics.</description>

Abstract: We study a particular Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton black hole configuration with cosmological constant, expressed in terms of the curvature radius, from the point of view of quasi-homogeneous thermodynamics. In particular, we show that the curvature radius and the coupling constant of the matter fields can be treated as thermodynamic variables in the framework of extended thermodynamics, leading in both cases to a van der Waals-like behavior. We also investigate in detail the stability and critical properties of the black holes and obtain results, which are compatible with the mean field approach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave memory and its effects on particles and fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave memory is said to arise when a gravitational wave burst produces changes in a physical system that persist even after that wave has passed. This paper analyzes gravitational wave bursts in plane wave spacetimes, deriving memory effects on timelike and null geodesics, massless scalar fields, and massless spinning particles whose motion is described by the spin Hall equations. All associated memory effects are found to be characterized by four ``memory tensors,'' three of which are independent. These tensors form a scattering matrix for the transverse components of geodesics. However, unlike for the ``classical'' memory effect involving initially comoving pairs of timelike geodesics, one of our results is that memory effects for null geodesics can have strong longitudinal components. When considering massless particles with spin, we solve the spin Hall equations analytically by showing that there exists a conservation law associated with each conformal Killing vector field. These solutions depend only on the same four memory tensors that control geodesic scattering. For massless scalar fields, we show that given any solution in flat spacetime, a weak-field solution in a plane wave spacetime can be generated just by differentiation. Precisely which derivatives are involved depend on the same four memory tensors. These effects are illustrated for scalar plane waves and higher-order Gaussian beams. Furthermore, we also present a numerical comparison between the dynamics of localized wave packets carrying angular momentum and the spin Hall equations.</description>

Abstract: Recently, an interesting \textit{doppelg\"ange} black hole solution is obtained in the string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg theory, where the black holes have the same radii but share different charges. We found, however, they possess different ISCOs and photon spheres, and hence affect their shadow images. In this work, we investigate the optical appearances, illuminated by an optically and geometrically thin disk, are investigated, of such black hole. One finds that doppelg\"ange black holes have different optical appearances. Even the horizon radii are the same, the size of shadows are not equal. Furthermore, we found that the large magnetic charge $Q_m$ black holes give rise to novel shadow images that the usual bright rings inside shadow are not clear, The optical appearances illuminated by spherically accretions are also examined, and it can also identify two doppelg\"ange black holes.</description>

Abstract: We study closed string evolution in the pp-wave spacetime assuming different pulse shapes (square and sech-squared) in the exact gravitational wave metric. It is shown that the shape of a circular closed string changes permanently to an elliptical form after the pulse has departed. The worldsheet geometry also displays characteristic permanent changes caused by the gravitational wave pulse. The above effects collectively demonstrate features akin to what is known as `memory' in gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate spacetime characterized by a hidden symmetry defined by a given Killing tensor. To exhibit this hidden symmetry, the inverse metric must commute with the Killing tensor under the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, which translates into a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) for the inverse metric. For some significant examples, we solve these PDEs directly, deriving spacetimes with prescribed hidden symmetries, including those specified by higher-rank Killing tensors. Utilizing the hidden symmetries, we study related problems such as null geodesics, photon region, and separation of variables of wave equations. Through this work, we aim to demonstrate that hidden symmetry is more accessible than previously believed.</description>

      <title>From the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularities to Einstein-Maxwell phantom wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime corresponds to a static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein equations with the energy momentum tensor of a massless quintessence field. It is understood that the spacetime describes a naked singularity. The solution has two parameters, $b$ and $s$. To our knowledge, the exact physical meaning of the two parameters is still unclear. In this paper, starting from the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution, we first obtain a wormhole solution by a complex transformation. Then let the parameter $s$ approaching infinity, we obtain the well-known exponential wormhole solution. After that, we embed both the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity and its wormhole counterpart in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe with the energy momentum tensor of massive quintessence and massive phantom fields, respectively. To our surprise, the resulting quintessence potential is actually the dilaton potential found by one of us. It hints us that, by modulating the parameters in the charged dilaton black hole solutions we can get the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution. Furthermore, a charged wormhole solution is obtained by performing complex transformation on the charged dilaton black hole solutions in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe. We eventually find that $s$ is actually related to the coupling constant of dilaton field to Maxwell field and $b$ is related to a negative mass for the dilaton black holes. A negative black hole mass is physically forbidden. Therefore, we conclude that the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution is not physically allowed.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Induced Gravitational Waves from a Smooth Crossover beyond Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial fluctuations can be affected by the modification of the sound speed $c^2_{\rm s}$ and the equation of state parameter $w$ once the curvature fluctuations reenter the cosmological horizon. That softening can also significantly boost the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) at the mass scale where the softening arises. In this work, we consider a hypothetical softening of $w$ and $c^2_{\rm s}$ caused by a smooth crossover beyond Standard Model theories, for what we numerically compute the secondary induced GW considering the case of a flat scale-invariant power spectrum. We find that if the amplitude of the power spectrum is sufficiently large, the characteristic feature of the GW signal caused by the smooth crossover can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave interferometers and differentiated from the pure radiation case. At the same time, depending on the mass scale where the crossover occurs, such a scenario can have compatibility with PBHs being all the dark matter when $\mathcal{A} \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, with a mass function very sharply peaked around the horizon mass scale of the minimum of the sound speed. Our results show that the GW signal can be used to resolve the existing degeneracy of sharply peaked mass function caused by peaked power spectrums and broad ones in the presence of softenings of $w$ and $c^2_{\rm s}$.</description>

Abstract: Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Hubble tension in Yukawa cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Yukawa cosmology, a recent discovery revealed a relationship between baryonic matter and the dark sector. The relation is described by the parameter {\alpha} and the long-range interaction parameter {\lambda} - an intrinsic property of the graviton. Applying the uncertainty relation to the graviton raises a compelling question: Is there a quantum mechanical limit to the measurement precision of the Hubble constant (H0)? We argue that the uncertainty relation for the graviton wavelength {\lambda} can be used to explain a running of H0 with redshift. We show that the uncertainty in time has an inverse correlation with the value of the Hubble constant. That means that the measurement of the Hubble constant is intrinsically linked to length scales (redshift) and is connected to the uncertainty in time. On cosmological scales, we found that the uncertainty in time is related to the look-back time quantity. For measurements with a high redshift value, there is more uncertainty in time, which leads to a smaller value for the Hubble constant. Conversely, there is less uncertainty in time for local measurements with a smaller redshift value, resulting in a higher value for the Hubble constant. Therefore, due to the uncertainty relation, the Hubble tension is believed to arise from fundamental limitations inherent in cosmological measurements. Finally, our findings indicate that the mass of the graviton fluctuates with specific scales, suggesting a possible mass-varying mechanism for the graviton.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM Tensions: Localising Missing Physics through Consistency Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04767</link>

Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM tensions are by definition model dependent; one sees anomalies through the prism of $\Lambda$CDM. Thus, progress towards tension resolution necessitates checking the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model to localise missing physics either in redshift or scale. Since the Universe is dynamical and redshift is a proxy for time, it is imperative to first perform consistency checks involving redshift, then consistency checks involving scale, as the next steps to settle the ``systematics versus new physics" debate and foster informed model building. We present a review of the hierarchy of assumptions underlying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and comment on whether relaxing them can address the tensions. We focus on the lowest lying fruit of identifying missing physics through the identification of redshift dependent $\Lambda$CDM model fitting parameters. We highlight recent progress made on ${S_8:= \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$ tension and elucidate how similar progress can be made on $H_0$ tension. Our discussions indicate that $H_0$ tension, equivalently a redshift dependent $H_0$, and a redshift dependent $S_8$ imply a problem with background $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Low Mass Naked Singularities from Dark Core Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-solar mass black holes (BHs) could have been involved in the two recent gravitational wave events, GW190425 and GW190814. Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Tensor clustering fossils in modified gravity and high-redshift gravitational-wave sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tensor clustering fossils as a possible probe to constrain the theory of gravity, in particular the deviation of the sound speed of gravitational waves from the speed of light at high redshifts. We develop the formalism of the effective Poisson equation to include the novel phenomenological model of the scalar-tensor tidal interactions that are expected to be induced by the modification of the theory of gravity. We show that the tensor clustering fossils can arise from the propagation of gravitational waves, the growth of the large-scale structures, and the second-order contributions from the effective Poisson equation. We construct the small-scale effective Lagrangian from the Horndeski scalar-tensor theory and derive the formula applicable to the tensor clustering fossils in the language of the effective field theory of dark energy. As a demonstration, we apply the formalism to the constraint on the sound speed of gravitational waves in the futuristic survey.</description>
