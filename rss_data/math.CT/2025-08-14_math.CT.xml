      <title>Toposes with enough points as categories of \'etale spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Makkai duality between coherent toposes and ultracategories to a duality between toposes with enough points and ultraconvergence spaces. Our proof generalizes and simplifies Makkai's original proof. Our main result can also be seen as an extension to ionads of Barr's equivalence between topological spaces and relational modules for the ultrafilter monad. In view of the correspondence between toposes and geometric theories, we obtain a strong conceptual completeness theorem, in the sense of Makkai, for geometric theories with enough Set-models. The same result has recently been obtained indepedently by Saadia (arXiv:2506.23935) and by Hamad (arXiv:2507.07922). Both of their proofs rely on groupoid representations of toposes, which our proof here does not assume.</description>

      <title>Poset-enriched pretoposes and compact ordered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterisation of the category $\mathsf{KOrd}$ of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces as a poset-enriched category. Up to equivalence, $\mathsf{KOrd}$ is the only non-degenerate poset-enriched pretopos whose terminal object is a (discrete) generator and in which every object is covered by an order-filtral object. Order-filtral objects satisfy an appropriate form of compactness and separation. Throughout, we make extensive use of the internal language of poset-enriched pretoposes.</description>

      <title>Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories, and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions, we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order, which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760, closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</description>

      <title>Continuous six-functor formalism on locally compact Hausdorff spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the functor sending a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ to the $\infty$-category of spectral sheaves $\mathrm{Shv}(X; \mathrm{Sp})$ is initial among all continuous six-functor formalisms on the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Here, continuous six-functor formalisms are those valued in dualizable presentable stable $\infty$-categories and satisfying canonical descent, profinite descent, and hyperdescent. As an application, we generalize Efimov's computation of the algebraic $K$-theory of sheaves to all localizing invariants on continuous six-functor formalisms. Our results show that localizing invariants behave analogously to compactly supported sheaf cohomology theories when evaluated on continuous six-functor formalisms on locally compact Hausdorff spaces.</description>
