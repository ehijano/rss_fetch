      <title>Adding MFMA Support to gem5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we have enhanced gem5's GPU model support to add Matrix Core Engines (MCEs). Specifically, on the AMD MI200 and MI300 GPUs that gem5 supports, these MCEs perform Matrix Fused Multiply Add (MFMA) instructions for a variety of precisions. By adding this support, our changes enable running state-of-the-art ML workloads in gem5, as well as examining how MCE optimizations impact the behavior of future systems.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Energy-Efficiency of Wearables Using Low-Precision Posit Arithmetic with PHEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable biomedical devices are increasingly being used for continuous patient health monitoring, enabling real-time insights and extended data collection without the need for prolonged hospital stays. These devices must be energy efficient to minimize battery size, improve comfort, and reduce recharging intervals. This paper investigates the use of specialized low-precision arithmetic formats to enhance the energy efficiency of biomedical wearables. Specifically, we explore posit arithmetic, a floating-point-like representation, in two key applications: cough detection for chronic cough monitoring and R peak detection in ECG analysis. Simulations reveal that 16-bit posits can replace 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point numbers with minimal accuracy loss in cough detection. For R peak detection, posit arithmetic achieves satisfactory accuracy with as few as 10 or 8 bits, compared to the 16-bit requirement for floating-point formats. To further this exploration, we introduce PHEE, a modular and extensible architecture that integrates the Coprosit posit coprocessor within a RISC-V-based system. Using the X-HEEP framework, PHEE seamlessly incorporates posit arithmetic, demonstrating reduced hardware area and power consumption compared to a floating-point counterpart system. Post-synthesis results targeting 16nm TSMC technology show that the posit hardware targeting these biomedical applications can be 38% smaller and consume up to 54% less energy at the functional unit level, with no performance compromise. These findings establish the potential of low-precision posit arithmetic to significantly improve the energy efficiency of wearable biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>FLASH-FHE: A Heterogeneous Architecture for Fully Homomorphic Encryption Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many hardware accelerators have recently been proposed to address the inefficiency problem of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes, none of them is able to deliver optimal performance when facing real-world FHE workloads consisting of a mixture of shallow and deep computations, due primarily to their homogeneous design principle.
  This paper presents FLASH-FHE, the first FHE accelerator with a heterogeneous architecture for mixed workloads. At its heart, FLASH-FHE designs two types of computation clusters, ie, bootstrappable and swift, to optimize for deep and shallow workloads respectively in terms of cryptographic parameters and hardware pipelines. We organize one bootstrappable and two swift clusters into one cluster affiliation, and present a scheduling scheme that provides sufficient acceleration for deep FHE workloads by utilizing all the affiliations, while improving parallelism for shallow FHE workloads by assigning one shallow workload per affiliation and dynamically decomposing the bootstrappable cluster into multiple swift pipelines to accelerate the assigned workload. We further show that these two types of clusters can share valuable on-chip memory, improving performance without significant resource consumption. We implement FLASH-FHE with RTL and synthesize it using both 7nm and 14/12nm technology nodes, and our experiment results demonstrate that FLASH-FHE achieves an average performance improvement of $1.4\times$ and $11.2\times$ compared to state-of-the-art FHE accelerators CraterLake and F1 for deep workloads, while delivering up to $8.0\times$ speedup for shallow workloads due to its heterogeneous architecture.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Randomized Cache Designs against Cache Occupancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomizing the address-to-set mapping and partitioning of the cache has been shown to be an effective mechanism in designing secured caches. Several designs have been proposed on a variety of rationales: (1) randomized design, (2) randomized-and-partitioned design, and (3) psuedo-fully associative design. This work fills in a crucial gap in current literature on randomized caches: currently most randomized cache designs defend only contention-based attacks, and leave out considerations of cache occupancy. We perform a systematic evaluation of 5 randomized cache designs- CEASER, CEASER-S, MIRAGE, Scatter-Cache, and Sass-cache against cache occupancy wrt. both performance as well as security.
  With respect to performance, we first establish that benchmarking strategies used by contemporary designs are unsuitable for a fair evaluation (because of differing cache configurations, choice of benchmarking suites, additional implementation-specific assumptions). We thus propose a uniform benchmarking strategy, which allows us to perform a fair and comparative analysis across all designs under various replacement policies. Likewise, with respect to security against cache occupancy attacks, we evaluate the cache designs against various threat assumptions: (1) covert channels, (2) process fingerprinting, and (3) AES key recovery (to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate full AES key recovery on a randomized cache design using cache occupancy attack). Our results establish the need to also consider cache occupancy side-channel in randomized cache design considerations.</description>

      <title>A 9T4R RRAM-Based ACAM for Analogue Template Matching at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous shift of computational bottlenecks to the memory access and data transfer, especially for AI applications, poses the urgent needs of re-engineering the computer architecture fundamentals. Many edge computing applications, like wearable and implantable medical devices, introduce increasingly more challenges to conventional computing systems due to the strict requirements of area and power at the edge. Emerging technologies, like Resistive RAM (RRAM), have shown a promising momentum in developing neuro-inspired analogue computing paradigms capable of achieving high classification capabilities alongside high energy efficiency. In this work, we present a novel RRAM-based Analogue Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) for on-line analogue template matching applications. This ACAM-based template matching architecture aims to achieve energy-efficient classification where low energy is of utmost importance. We are showcasing a highly tuneable novel RRAM-based ACAM pixel implemented using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology and in-house RRAM technology and exhibiting low energy dissipation of approximately 0.036pJ and 0.16pJ for mismatch and match, respectively, at 66MHz with 3V voltage supply. A proof-of-concept system-level implementation based on this novel pixel design is also implemented in 180nm.</description>
