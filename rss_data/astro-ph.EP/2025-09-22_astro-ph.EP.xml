      <title>Astrometric exomoon detection by means of optical interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: With no conclusive detection to date, the search for exomoons, satellites of planets orbiting other stars, remains a formidable challenge. Detecting these objects, compiling a population-level sample and constraining their occurrence will inform planet and moon formation models and shed light on moon habitability. Aims: Here, we demonstrate the possibility of a moon search based on astrometric time series data, repeated measurements of the position of a given planet relative to its host star. The perturbing influence of an orbiting moon induces a potentially detectable planetary reflex motion. Methods: Based on an analytical description of the astrometric signal amplitude, we place the expected signatures of putative moons around real exoplanets into context with our current and future astrometric measurement precision. Modelling the orbital perturbation as a function of time, we then simulate the detection process to obtain the first astrometric exomoon sensitivity curves. Results: The astrometric technique already allows for the detection and characterisation of favourable moons around giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. On the basis of 12 epochs obtained with VLTI/GRAVITY, it is already today possible to infer the presence of a 0.14 $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{Jup}$ satellite at a separation of 0.39 AU around AF Lep b. Future facilities offering better precision will refine our sensitivity in both moon mass and separation from the host planet by several orders of magnitude. Conclusions: The astrometric method of exomoon detection provides a promising avenue towards making the detection of these elusive worlds a reality and efficiently building a sample of confirmed objects. With a future facility that achieves an astrometric precision of 1 mas, probing for Earth-like moons within the habitable zone of a given star will become a realistic proposition.</description>

      <title>Untapped: Veloce Detects Calcium in the Atmosphere of WASP-189b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution transmission spectroscopy has become a powerful tool for detecting atomic and ionic species in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the Australian-built Veloce spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope can resolve atmospheric signatures from transiting exoplanets. We observed a single transit of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189b - a favourable target given its extreme irradiation and bright host star - and applied the cross-correlation technique using standardised templates. We robustly detect ionised calcium (Ca+), and find evidence for hydrogen (H), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), neutral calcium (Ca), titanium (Ti), ionised titanium (Ti+), ionised iron (Fe+), neutral iron (Fe), and ionised strontium (Sr+). The strongest detection was achieved in the red arm of Veloce, consistent with expectations due to the prominent Ca+ triplet at wavelengths around 850-870 nm. Our results validate Veloce's capability for high-resolution atmospheric studies, highlighting it as an accessible, flexible facility to complement larger international telescopes. If future observations stack multiple transits, Veloce has the potential to reveal atmospheric variability, phase-dependent spectral changes, and detailed chemical compositions of highly irradiated exoplanets.</description>

      <title>THYME XIII: Two young Neptunes orbiting a 75-Myr star in the Alpha Persei Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young planets with mass measurements are particularly valuable in studying atmospheric mass-loss processes, but these planets are rare and their masses difficult to measure due to stellar activity. We report the discovery of a planetary system around TOI-6109, a young, 75 Myr-old Sun-like star in the Alpha Persei cluster. It hosts at least two transiting Neptune-like planets. Using three TESS sectors, 30 CHEOPS orbits, and photometric follow-up observations from the ground, we confirm the signals of the two planets. TOI-6109 b has an orbital period of P=$5.6904^{+0.0004}_{-0.0004}$ days and a radius of R=$4.87^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ R$_\oplus$. The outer planet, TOI-6109 c has an orbital period of P=$8.5388^{+0.0006}_{-0.0005}$ days and a radius of R=$4.83^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ R$_\oplus$. These planets orbit just outside a 3:2 mean motion resonance. The near-resonant configuration presents the opportunity to measure the planet's mass via TTV measurements and to bypass difficult RV measurements. Measuring the masses of the planets in this system will allow us to test theoretical models of atmospheric mass loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Analysis of the HD 169142 Planet-Forming Disk: Twelve Years of High-Contrast Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical analysis of the HD 169142 planet-forming disk based on high-contrast polarimetric imaging over a twelve-year observational period, offering insights into its disk evolution and planet-disk interactions. This study explores the evolution of scattered-light features and their relationship with millimeter continuum emission. Archival visible-to-near-infrared scattered-light observations from NACO, SPHERE, and GPI combined with new observations from SCExAO reveal persistent non-axisymmetric structures in both the inner and outer rings of the disk. Through Keplerian image transformations and phase cross-correlation techniques, we show that the azimuthal brightness variations in the inner ring follow the local Keplerian velocity, suggesting these are intrinsic disk features rather than planet-induced spirals or shadows. The motion of the outer ring is weakly detected, requiring a longer observational baseline for further confirmation. Comparing scattered-light features with ALMA 1.3 mm-continuum data, we find that the scattered light traces the edges of dust structures in the inner ring, indicating complex interactions and a leaky dust trap around the water-ice snowline. These findings highlight the capability of long-term monitoring of circumstellar disks to distinguish planetary influences from Keplerian disk dynamics.</description>

      <title>A high geometric albedo and small size of the Haumea cluster member (24835) 1995 SM55 from a stellar occultation and photometric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are among the most ancient bodies of the solar system. Understanding their physical properties is key to constraining their origin and the evolution of the outer regions beyond Neptune. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape information. (24835) 1995 SM55 is one of the few members of the Haumea cluster and thus of particular interest. We aimed to determine its projected size, absolute magnitude, and geometric albedo, and to compare these with Haumea. A stellar occultation on 25 February 2024 was observed from five sites, with seven positive detections and 33 negative chords. An elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields semi-axes of $(104.3 \pm 0.4) \times (83.5 \pm 0.5)$ km, giving an area-equivalent diameter of $186.7 \pm 1.8$ km, smaller than the 250 km upper limit from Herschel thermal data. Photometry provides an absolute magnitude $H_V = 4.55 \pm 0.03$, a phase slope of $0.04 \pm 0.02$ mag/deg, and a $V-R = 0.37 \pm 0.05$. The rotational variability has an amplitude $\Delta m = 0.05$ mag, but the period remains uncertain. Combining occultation and photometry, we derive a geometric albedo $p_V = 0.80 \pm 0.04$, one of the highest values measured for a TNO. This value is slightly higher than that of Haumea, consistent with the interpretation that 1995 SM55 belongs to the Haumea cluster.</description>

      <title>Detection and characterisation of a 106-day transiting Jupiter : TOI-2449 b / NGTS-36 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only a handful of transiting giant exoplanets with orbital periods longer than 100 days are known. These warm exoplanets are valuable objects as their radius and mass can be measured leading to an in-depth characterisation of the planet's properties. Thanks to low levels of stellar irradiation and large orbital distances, the atmospheric properties and orbital parameters of warm exoplanets remain relatively unaltered by their host star, giving new insights into planetary formation and evolution. We aim at extending the sample of warm giant exoplanets with precise radii and masses. Our goal is to identify suitable candidates in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data and perform follow-up observations with ground-based instruments. We use the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) to detect additional transits of planetary candidates in order to pinpoint their orbital period. We also monitored the target with several high-resolution spectrographs to measure the planetary mass and eccentricity. We report the discovery of a 106-day period Jupiter-sized planet around the G-type star TOI-2449 / NGTS-36. We jointly modelled the photometric and radial velocity data and find that the planet has a mass of 0.70 Mj and a radius of 1.002 Rj. The planetary orbit has a semi-major axis of 0.449 au and is slightly eccentric. We detect an additional 3-year signal in the radial velocity data likely due to the stellar magnetic cycle. Based on the planetary evolution models considered here, we find that TOI-2449 b / NGTS-36 b contains 11 Me of heavy elements and has a marginal planet-to-star metal enrichment of 3.3. Assuming a Jupiter-like Bond albedo, TOI-2449 b / NGTS-36 b has an equilibrium temperature of 400 K and is a good target for understanding nitrogen chemistry in cooler atmospheres.</description>

      <title>DiskMINT: Self-Consistent Thermochemical Disk Models with Radially Varying Gas and Dust -- Application to the Massive, CO-Rich Disk of IM Lup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disks around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, and the spatial distribution of their gas and dust masses is critical for understanding where and what types of planets can form. We present self-consistent thermochemical disk models built with DiskMINT, which extends its initial framework to allow for spatially decoupled gas and dust distributions. DiskMINT calculates the gas temperature based on thermal equilibrium with dust grains, solves vertical gas hydrostatic equilibrium, and includes key processes for the CO chemistry, specifically selective photodissociation, and freeze-out with conversion CO/CO$_2$ ice. We apply DiskMINT to study the IM Lup disk, a large massive disk, yet with an inferred CO depletion of up to 100 based on earlier thermochemical models. By fitting the multi-wavelength SED along with the millimeter continuum, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ radial emission profiles, we find $0.02-0.08\,{\rm M_\odot}$ for the gas disk mass, which are consistent with the dynamical-based mass within the uncertainties. We further compare the derived surface densities for dust and gas and find that the outer disk is drift-dominated, with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of approximately 0.01-0.02, which is likely insufficient to meet the conditions for the streaming instability to occur. Our results suggest that when interpreted with self-consistent thermochemical models, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ alone can serve as a reliable tracer of both the total gas mass and its radial distribution. This approach enables gas mass estimates in lower-mass disks, where dynamical constraints are not available, and in fainter systems where rare species like ${\rm N_2H^+}$ are too weak to detect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Southern Hemisphere Asteroid Research Project is an active and informal entity comprising the University of New South Wales, the University of Tasmania, the University of Western Australia, and the Curtin University, which performs asteroid research in collaboration with federal agencies, including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (JPL). Since 2015, we have used the Australian infrastructure to characterize more than 50 near-Earth asteroids through bistatic radar observations. On 29 June 2024, we used four very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) radio telescopes to follow the close approach of 2024 MK to the Earth. In this paper, we describe the detections and the analysis of VLBI and howthese observations can help to improve the understanding of its composition and orbit characterization.</description>

      <title>New migration patterns in high planet-star mass ratio systems in disks with low viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration of giant planets remains a complex topic. While significant progress has been made for high-viscosity disks, the migration of planets with large planet-star mass ratios in low-viscosity environments is still not fully understood. We study the migration of such planets in disks with $\alpha = 10^{-4}$ and derive analytical prescriptions applicable across stellar masses, from Sun-like stars to M dwarfs. Using hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, we explored planets with mass ratios $10^{-3} &lt; q &lt; 2 \times 10^{-2}$ under different disk conditions, varying gas surface density, scale height, and density slope. Our results show a migration reversal at $ q \approx 0.002$, with outward migration for $ q &gt; 0.002$. For planets undergoing outward migration, the migration speed depends on the unperturbed local gas density. In most cases, outward migration is sustained by a positive torque related to planetary eccentricities below $ e &lt; 0.2$. However, for certain disk parameters, planets with $ q &gt; 0.01$ reach higher eccentricities ($0.2 &lt; e &lt; 0.45$), leading to stalled migration. Our findings suggest that outward migration is a viable mechanism for massive planets in low-viscosity disks, which has implications for the formation and distribution of super-Jupiter planets around Sun-like stars and planets more massive than Neptune around very low-mass stars. Given the challenges in detecting such planets, improving our theoretical understanding of their migration is essential for interpreting exoplanet demographics and guiding future observational efforts.</description>

      <title>ATREIDES I. Embarking on a trek across the exo-Neptunian landscape with the TOI-421 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of close-in exoplanets is shaped by the interplay between atmospheric and dynamical processes. The Neptunian Desert, Ridge, and Savanna illustrate the sensitivity of these worlds to such processes, making them ideal to disentangle their roles. Determining how many Neptunes were brought close-in by early disk-driven migration (DDM; maintaining primordial spin-orbit alignment) or late high-eccentricity migration (HEM; generating large misalignments) is essential to understand how much atmosphere they lost. We propose a unified view of the Neptunian landscape to guide its exploration, speculating that the Ridge is a hot spot for evolutionary processes. Low-density Neptunes would mainly undergo DDM, getting fully eroded at shorter periods than the Ridge, while denser Neptunes would be brought to the Ridge and Desert by HEM. We embark on this exploration via ATREIDES, which relies on spectroscopy and photometry of 60 close-in Neptunes, their reduction with robust pipelines, and their interpretation through internal structure, atmospheric, and evolutionary models. We carried out a systematic RM census with VLT/ESPRESSO to measure the distribution of 3D spin-orbit angles, correlate its shape with system properties and thus relate the fraction of aligned-misaligned systems to DDM, HEM, and atmospheric erosion. Our first target, TOI-421c, lies in the Savanna with a neighboring sub-Neptune TOI-421b. We measured their 3D spin-orbit angles (Psib = 57+11-15 deg; Psic = 44.9+4.4-4.1 deg). Together with the eccentricity and possibly large mutual inclination of their orbits, this hints at a chaotic dynamical origin that could result from DDM followed by HEM. ATREIDES will provide the community with a wealth of constraints for formation and evolution models. We welcome collaborations that will contribute to pushing our understanding of the Neptunian landscape forward.</description>

      <title>ExoIris: fast exoplanet transmission spectroscopy in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present ExoIris, a user-friendly Python package for exoplanet transmission and emission spectroscopy. Unlike existing tools, ExoIris models two-dimensional spectrophotometric transit time series directly and supports the joint analysis of multiple datasets obtained with different instruments and at different epochs. These features enable a self-consistent estimation of both wavelength-independent and wavelength-dependent parameters. They offer a more robust workflow compared to the commonly used two-step approach, where a "white" light curve is fitted first and the transmission spectrum is then derived from independent fits constrained by the white-light solution. Despite its increased flexibility and robustness, ExoIris remains computationally efficient. A low-resolution transmission spectrum can be estimated from a single JWST NIRISS transit observation in ~5 minutes assuming white noise, and in ~15 minutes when accounting for time-correlated systematics using a Gaussian process noise model, on a standard desktop computer.</description>

      <title>MINDS: The very low-mass star and brown dwarf sample II. Probing disk settling, dust properties, and dust-gas interplay with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS) provide environments for the formation of Earth-like planets. Mid-infrared observations have revealed that these disks exhibit weak silicate features and strong hydrocarbon emissions. This study characterizes the dust properties and geometrical structures of VLMS and brown dwarf (BD) disks, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and connects these to gas column density and potential evolutionary stages. We analyze mid-infrared spectra of ten VLMS and BD disks as a part of the MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) program. Spectral slopes and silicate band strengths are compared with hydrocarbon emission line ratios, which probe the gas column density. Moreover, the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas is used to quantify grain sizes, dust compositions, and crystallinity in the disk surface. The disks are classified into less, more, and fully settled geometries based on their mid-infrared spectral slopes and silicate band strengths. Less-settled disks show a relatively strong silicate band, high spectral slopes, and low crystallinity, and are dominated by 5 $\mu$m-sized grains. More-settled disks have weaker silicate band, low spectral slope, enhanced crystallinity, and higher mass fractions of smaller grains. Fully-settled disks exhibit little or no silicate emission and negative spectral slopes. An overall trend of increasing gas column density with decreasing spectral slope suggests that more molecular gas is exposed when the dust opacity decreases due to dust settling. Our findings may reflect possible evolutionary pathways with dust settling and thermal processing or may point to inner-disk clearing or a collisional cascade. These results highlight the need for broader samples to understand the link between dust and gas appearance in regions where Earth-like planets form.</description>

      <title>Revising core powered mass loss: A critical assessment of the "energy limited" argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme conditions in the early stages of planetary evolution are thought to shape its subsequent development. High internal temperatures from giant impacts can provide sufficient energy to drive extreme volatile loss, with hydrogen being most readily lost. However, the conditions required for maintaining a primordial atmosphere over geological timescales remain enigmatic. This paper revisits the core powered mass loss model for hydrogen removal from planetary atmospheres. One popular approach is to combine mass continuity at the sonic point with an energy-based constraint. We demonstrate that the so-called ``energy limited'' component of this model is unnecessary because atmospheric loss following giant impacts is governed solely by conditions at the sonic point. By simulating a broad range of synthetic exoplanets, varying in planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and temperature, we find that the ``energy limited'' model can underestimate the mass loss rates by up to eight orders of magnitude. Our findings suggest that, for sufficiently hot post-impact surface conditions, hydrogen rich atmospheres can be removed on dynamical timescales that are far shorter than one million years.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: Sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere of the Neptune-mass planet HAT-P-26 b from NIRSpec G395H transmission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-26 b (18.6 Earth masses, 6.33 Earth radii), based on a single transit observed with the JWST NIRSpec G395H grating. We detect water vapor (ln B = 4.1), carbon dioxide (ln B = 85.6), and sulfur dioxide (ln B = 13.5) with high confidence, along with marginal indications for hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide (ln B &lt; 0.5). The detection of SO2 in a warm super-Neptune sized exoplanet (radius about 6 Earth radii) bridges the gap between previous detections in hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, highlighting the role of disequilibrium photochemistry across a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres, including those cooler than 1000 K. Our precise measurements of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur indicate an atmospheric metallicity of about 10 times solar and a sub-solar C/O ratio. Retrieved molecular abundances are consistent within 2 sigma with predictions from self-consistent models including photochemistry. The elevated CO2 abundance and possible H2S signal may also reflect sensitivities to the thermal structure, cloud properties, or additional disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing. We compare the SO2 abundance in HAT-P-26 b with that of ten other JWST-observed giant exoplanets, and find a correlation with atmospheric metallicity. The trend is consistent with the prediction from Crossfield (2023), showing a steep rise in SO2 abundance at low metallicities, and a more gradual increase beyond 30 times solar. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).</description>

      <title>Discovery of carbon monoxide emission from five debris disks around young A-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past fifteen years, surveys mainly at millimeter wavelengths have led to the discovery of $\sim$20 gas-bearing debris disks, most of them surrounding young intermediate-mass stars. Exploring the properties and origin of this gas could be fundamental to better understanding the transition between the protoplanetary and debris disk phases, the evolution of icy planetesimal belts, and the formation of planetary atmospheres. To expand the list of known CO-bearing debris disks and to improve our knowledge of the environmental conditions under which they can form, we targeted twelve dust-rich debris disks around young ($&lt;$50 Myr) intermediate-mass stars. Using the ALMA 12-m Array we performed millimeter continuum and CO line observations to search for dust and gas and to measure their quantity and spatial distribution. We discovered CO gas in five disks. Two of them have a low CO content of a few times 10$^{-5}$ M$_\oplus$, similar to that of $\beta$ Pic. The other three disks, however, are CO-rich with $M_\mathrm{CO}&gt;10^{-3}$ M$_\oplus$. By combining our results with those of other studies we concluded, in agreement with previous findings, that the detection rate of CO gas is significantly higher for disks around stars with $6.5~L_\odot&lt;L_*&lt;21.9~L_\odot$ ($\sim$A8$-$A0 spectral type) than for disks around less luminous stars ($0.18~L_\odot&lt;L_*&lt;6.4~L_\odot$, K7$-$A9). A comparison of the measured CO masses and the estimated mass loss rates of solids in disks with low CO content ($&lt;$10$^{-4}$ M$_\oplus$) suggests that collisions may play a role in CO gas production in such systems. Interestingly, however, the estimated mass loss rates of CO-rich debris disks are not higher than those of systems with low CO content. In light of this finding, we speculate on what could lead to the formation of CO-rich debris disks.</description>

      <title>Binary-lens Microlensing Degeneracy: Impact on Planetary Sensitivity and Mass-ratio Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\sim10\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We also discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for future applications.</description>

      <title>Potential for Lunar Interior Science by the Gravitational-Wave Detector LILA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), a concept for measuring sub-Hz gravitational waves on the Moon, would use laser strainmeters to obtain extremely sensitive strain measurements from 1 mHz to 1 Hz. With proposed strain sensitivities, LILA would also be able to measure the normal modes of the Moon from 1-10 mHz at high signal-to-noise ratio. Such measurements would enable significant advances in our understanding of both the spherically symmetric and even 3D deep internal structure of the Moon. Strainmeter measurements may even be able to detect the translational mode of the solid inner core of the Moon at frequencies below 0.1 mHz. Inertial seismometers, on the other hand, are unlikely to reach the performance of $\sim10^{-16}$ m/s$^2$/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ required to reliably detect normal modes below 5-10 mHz, even with optimistic assumptions on future projected performance.</description>

      <title>SCALES-DRP : A Data Reduction Pipeline for an Upcoming Keck Thermal Infrared Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the end-to-end data reduction pipeline for SCALES (Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy), the upcoming thermal-infrared, diffraction-limited imager, and low and medium-resolution integral field spectrograph (IFS) for the Keck II telescope. The pipeline constructs a ramp from a set of reads and performs optimal extraction and chi-square extraction to reconstruct the 3D IFS datacube. To perform spectral extraction, wavelength calibration, and sky subtraction, the pipeline utilizes rectification matrices produced using position-dependent lenslet point spread functions (PSFs) derived from calibration exposures. The extracted 3D data cubes provide intensity values along with their corresponding uncertainties for each spatial and spectral measurement. The SCALES pipeline is under active development, implemented in Python within the Keck data reduction framework, and is openly available on GitHub along with dedicated documentation.</description>

      <title>Partially Molten Plumes and Melt-Fingers: Two Modes of Magma-Transport through the Mantle in Terrestrial Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of partially molten mantle in terrestrial bodies, we carried out a linear perturbation analysis and 2-D numerical simulations of magma-matrix flow in a horizontal layer, where decompression melting generates magma that percolates through the convecting matrix. Our study shows that there are two regimes for the upward migration of magma, depending on the melt-buoyancy parameter B_m, which is the ratio of the Stokes velocity of matrix to the percolation velocity of melt, both driven by the melt-buoyancy. At large B_m, the magmatism-mantle upwelling (MMUb) feedback dominates the convective flow in the layer: decompression melting during upwelling enhances magma buoyancy, which further strengthens the upwelling. When a solid layer is overlaid on the partially molten layer, the MMUb feedback induces partially molten plumes that ascend through the solid layer by their melt-buoyancy. At lower B_m, in contrast, a perturbation in the melt-content in the partially molten layer propagates upward as a porosity wave: the perturbation induces a spatial variation in the rate of expansion or contraction of matrix caused by magma migration, leading to an upward shift of the perturbation. When a solid layer is overlaid, the porosity wave develops also along the layer boundary to induce a finger-like magma structure, or melt-finger, that extends upward into the solid layer. The threshold value of B_m for MMUb feedback suggests that it can explain volcanism forming Large Igneous Provinces, but not hotspot volcanism on Earth. Since B_m increases with decreasing matrix viscosity, volcanism caused by the MMUb feedback is likely to have been more important in earlier terrestrial planets where the mantle was hotter and softer. Melt-fingers are, in contrast, expected to have developed in the lunar mantle if a partially molten layer has developed at its base in the history of the Moon.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: Water Ice in the Coma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, obtained with Gemini-S/GMOS and NASA IRTF/SpeX on 2025 July 5 and July 14. The optical spectrum shows a red slope of approximately 10% per 1000 angstroms between 0.5 and 0.8 microns, closely resembling that of typical D-type asteroids. At longer wavelengths, the near-infrared spectrum flattens significantly to approximately 3% per 1000 angstroms from 0.9 to 1.5 microns, consistent with the spectral behavior of large water ice grains in the coma. Spectral modeling with an areal mixture of 70% Tagish Lake meteorite and 30% 10-micron-sized water ice successfully reproduces both the overall continuum and the broad absorption feature near 2.0 microns. The 1.5-micron water ice band, however, is not detected, likely due to the limited signal-to-noise of the IRTF data and dilution by refractory materials. The ~30% ice fraction should be interpreted as an approximate, order-of-magnitude estimate of the coma composition. The agreement between the GMOS and SpeX spectra, taken nine days apart, suggests short-term stability in the coma's optical properties. Our observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS is an active interstellar comet containing abundant water ice, with a dust composition more similar to D-type asteroids than to ultrared trans-Neptunian objects.</description>

      <title>Pre-discovery TESS Observations of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, also known as C2025 N1 (ATLAS), is the third known macroscopic interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. We report serendipitous Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations of 3I/ATLAS taken between 2025-05-07 and 2025-06-02, 55 days prior to the discovery date (2025-07-01). We retrieve the TESS pixel data, perform a robust background correction and use a data-driven approach to compute the objects position on the TESS detectors. We find a consistent offset between the targets observed and predicted positions which is dominated by uncertainty in the TESS World Coordinate System (WCS) rather than ephemeris errors. 3I/ATLAS is too faint to be detected in the individual 200 second TESS integrations, so we stack images to improve detectability. We perform aperture and Pixel Response Function (PRF) photometry on the stacked images to create two light curves. Each light curve consists of 15 measurements with $\text{SNR}&gt;3$, collected across two different TESS cameras during the 26 days that the object was observed. The PRF light curve, which is more robust against image noise, in the TESS bandpass shows a gradual increase in brightness from $T_{\text{mag}}=20.9\pm0.29$ to $19.57\pm0.15$. This is expected as 3I/ATLAS approaches the inner Solar System. Its absolute magnitude decreases from $H_{V}=14.3\pm0.4$ to $13.7\pm0.3$ and shows signs of faint activity consistent with other observations. This paper highlights the power of using TESS for Solar System science by increasing the number of pre-discovery observations, in an otherwise sparsely populated region of the light curve, the long-term behavior of 3I/ATLAS can be investigated.</description>

Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>
