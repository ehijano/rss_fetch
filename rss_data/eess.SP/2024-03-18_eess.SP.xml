      <title>A Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Reliable Network Slicing in a Blockchain-Secured Low-Latency Wireless Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network slicing (NS) is a promising technology that supports diverse requirements for next-generation low-latency wireless communication networks. However, the tampering attack is a rising issue of jeopardizing NS service-provisioning. To resist tampering attacks in NS networks, we propose a novel optimization framework for reliable NS resource allocation in a blockchain-secured low-latency wireless network, where trusted base stations (BSs) with high reputations are selected for blockchain management and NS service-provisioning. For such a blockchain-secured network, we consider that the latency is measured by the summation of blockchain management and NS service-provisioning, whilst the NS reliability is evaluated by the BS denial-of-service (DoS) probability. To satisfy the requirements of both the latency and reliability, we formulate a constrained computing resource allocation optimization problem to minimize the total processing latency subject to the BS DoS probability. To efficiently solve the optimization, we design a constrained deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which satisfies both latency and DoS probability requirements by introducing an additional critic neural network. The proposed constrained DRL further solves the issue of high input dimension by incorporating feature engineering technology. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving reliable and low-latency NS service-provisioning in the considered blockchain-secured wireless network.</description>

      <title>Decentralizing Coherent Joint Transmission Precoding via Deterministic Equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to control the inter-cell interference for a multi-cell multi-user multiple-input multiple-output network, we consider the precoder design for coordinated multi-point with downlink coherent joint transmission. To avoid costly information exchange among the cooperating base stations in a centralized precoding scheme, we propose a decentralized one by considering the power minimization problem. By approximating the inter-cell interference using the deterministic equivalents, this problem is decoupled to sub-problems which are solved in a decentralized manner at different base stations. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed decentralized precoding scheme, where only 2 ~ 7% more transmit power is needed compared with the optimal centralized precoder.</description>

      <title>NR-Surface: NextG-ready $\mu$W-reconfigurable mmWave Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface has recently emerged as an economic solution to expand mmWave coverage. However, their pervasive deployment remains a challenge, mainly due to the difficulty in reaching the tight 260ns NR synchronization requirement and real-time wireless reconfiguration while maintaining multi-year battery life. This paper presents NR-Surface, the first real-time reconfigurable metasurface fully compliant with the NR standard, operating at 242.7 $\mu$W for a 2.1-year lifetime on an AA battery. NR-Surface incorporates (i) a new extremely low-power (14KHz sampling) reconfiguration interface, NarrowBand Packet Unit (NBPU), for synchronization and real-time reconfiguration, and (ii) a highly responsive and low-leakage metasurface designed for low-duty cycled operation, by carefully leveraging the structure and the periodicity of the NR beam management procedure in the NR standard. NR-Surface is prototyped and evaluated end-to-end with NR BS built on srsRAN to demonstrate diverse usage scenarios including multiple NR-Surface per BS, multiple UE per NR-Surface, and 3D beamforming. Around-the-corner UE evaluations showcase NR-Surface efficacy under different user mobility patterns (20.3dB gain) and dynamic blockage (22.2dB gain).</description>

      <title>A Belief Propagation Algorithm for Multipath-based SLAM with Multiple Map Features: A mmWave MIMO Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that continuously adapts mulitiple map feature (MF) models describing specularly reflected multipath components (MPCs) from flat surfaces and point-scattered MPCs, respectively. We develop a Bayesian model for sequential detection and estimation of interacting MF model parameters, MF states and mobile agent's state including position and orientation. The Bayesian model is represented by a factor graph enabling the use of belief propagation (BP) for efficient computation of the marginal posterior distributions. The algorithm also exploits amplitude information enabling reliable detection of weak MFs associated with MPCs of very low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using real millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) measurements with single base station setup. Results demonstrate the excellent localization and mapping performance of the proposed algorithm in challenging dynamic outdoor scenarios.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization for Achieving Covertness in MIMO Over-the-Air Computation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates covert data transmission within a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) over-the-air computation (AirComp) network, where sensors transmit data to the access point (AP) while guaranteeing covertness to the warden (Willie). Simultaneously, the AP introduces artificial noise (AN) to confuse Willie, meeting the covert requirement. We address the challenge of minimizing mean-square-error (MSE) of the AP, while considering transmit power constraints at both the AP and the sensors, as well as ensuring the covert transmission to Willie with a low detection error probability (DEP). However, obtaining globally optimal solutions for the investigated non-convex problem is challenging due to the interdependence of optimization variables. To tackle this problem, we introduce an exact penalty algorithm and transform the optimization problem into a difference-of-convex (DC) form problem to find a locally optimal solution. Simulation results showcase the superior performance in terms of our proposed scheme in comparison to the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Localization and Data Association for Time-Difference of Arrival Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of localizing multiple signal sources based on time-difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements. In the blind setting, in which the source signals are not known, the localization task is challenging due to the data association problem. That is, it is not known which of the TDOA measurements correspond to the same source. Herein, we propose to perform joint localization and data association by means of an optimal transport formulation. The method operates by finding optimal groupings of TDOA measurements and associating these with candidate source locations. To allow for computationally feasible localization in three-dimensional space, an efficient set of candidate locations is constructed using a minimal multilateration solver based on minimal sets of receiver pairs. In numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust both to measurement noise and TDOA detection errors. Furthermore, it is shown that the data association provided by the proposed method allows for statistically efficient estimates of the source locations.</description>

      <title>Bias Control and Linearization of the Transfer Function of Electro-optic and Acousto-optic Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several types of quantum computers light is one of the main tools to control both the position and the quantum state of the atoms used for computing. In practical systems laser light is applied to manipulate quantum states of qubits in the desired way. Beside physical effects like decoherence and quantum noise the precision of qubit manipulation has a significant impact on the achievable quantum computing error rate. One of the key optical components beside the laser is the optical modulator, which modulates or switches a constant power laser light in order to provide light pulses or pulse sequences with a desired envelope. Acousto-optic (AOM) and electro-optic (EOM) modulators can be applied, which are both voltage controlled. However, there is neither a simple linear relationship between their control signal and the precise modulator output, nor can they be considered to have time-invariant characteristics. The aim of this paper is to describe techniques to generate AOM and EOM control signals in such a way that almost arbitrary target output waveforms (i. e. optical power versus time) are achieved with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Beam Pattern Modulation Embedded mmWave Hybrid Transceiver Design Towards ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) emerges as a promising technology for B5G/6G, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. However, the widespread adoption of hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to limited radio-frequency chains, resulting in mediocre performance when embedding sensing functionality. To avoid sacrificing the spectrum efficiency in hybrid structures while addressing performance bottlenecks in its extension to ISAC, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC). BPM-ISAC applies index modulation over beamspace by selectively activating communication beams, aiming to minimize sensing beampattern mean squared error (MSE) under communication MSE constraints through dedicated hybrid transceiver design. Optimization involves the analog part through a min-MSE-based beam selection algorithm, followed by the digital part using an alternating optimization algorithm. Convergence and asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) analyses accompany numerical simulations, validating its overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>PnP Restoration with Domain Adaptation for SANS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) is a non-destructive technique utilized to probe the nano- to mesoscale structure of materials by analyzing the scattering pattern of neutrons. Accelerating SANS acquisition for in-situ analysis is essential, but it often reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), highlighting the need for methods to enhance SNR even with short acquisition times. While deep learning (DL) can be used for enhancing SNR of low quality SANS, the amount of experimental data available for training is usually severely limited. We address this issue by proposing a Plug-and-play Restoration for SANS (PR-SANS) that uses domain-adapted priors. The prior in PR-SANS is initially trained on a set of generic images and subsequently fine-tuned using a limited amount of experimental SANS data. We present a theoretical convergence analysis of PR-SANS by focusing on the error resulting from using inexact domain-adapted priors instead of the ideal ones. We demonstrate with experimentally collected SANS data that PR-SANS can recover high-SNR 2D SANS detector images from low-SNR detector images, effectively increasing the SNR. This advancement enables a reduction in acquisition times by a factor of 12 while maintaining the original signal quality.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Transmission in UAV-Aided LoRa Networks Featuring Wake-Up Radios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a LoRa sensor network featuring a UAV-mounted gateway for collecting sensor data (messages). Wake-up radios (WuR) are employed to inform the sensors of the UAV's arrival. Building on an existing random access scheme for such setups, we propose and evaluate two redundancy transmission protocols for enhancing the reliability of the data transfer. One protocol employs fountain-coded transmissions, whereas the other performs message replication. Our results illustrate how redundancy transmission can be beneficial under the time constraints imposed by the UAV's limited hovering duration, and how node density, hovering time, and sensor energy budget impact the performance of the schemes.</description>

      <title>Joint Group Scheduling and Multicast Beamforming for Downlink Large-Scale Multi-Group Multicast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks need to handle massive user access effectively. This paper addresses the problem of joint group scheduling and multicast beamforming for downlink multicast with many active groups. Aiming to maximize the minimum user throughput, we propose a three-phase approach to tackle this difficult joint optimization problem efficiently. In Phase 1, we utilize the optimal multicast beamforming structure obtained recently to find the group-channel directions for all groups. We propose two low-complexity scheduling algorithms in Phase 2, which determine the subset of groups in each time slot sequentially and the total number of time slots required for all groups. The first algorithm measures the level of spatial separation among groups and selects the dissimilar groups that maximize the minimum user rate into the same time slot. In contrast, the second algorithm first identifies the spatially correlated groups via a learning-based clustering method based on the group-channel directions, and then separates spatially similar groups into different time slots. Finally, the multicast beamformers for the scheduled groups are obtained in each time slot by a computationally efficient method. Simulation results show that our proposed approaches can effectively capture the level of spatial separation among groups for scheduling to improve the minimum user throughput over the conventional approach that serves all groups in a single time slot or one group per time slot, and can be executed with low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Fairness Optimization for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Uplink Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the fair transmission design for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). IRS is used to establish a good signal propagation environment and enhance the RSMA transmission performance. The fair rate adaption problem is constructed as a max-min optimization problem. To solve the optimization problem, we adopt an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize the power allocation, beamforming, and decoding order, respectively. A generalized power iteration (GPI) method is proposed to optimize the receive beamforming, which can improve the minimum rate of devices and reduce the optimization complexity. At the base station (BS), a successive group decoding (SGD) algorithm is proposed to tackle the uplink signal estimation, which trades off the fairness and complexity of decoding. At the same time, we also consider robust communication with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which studies robust optimization by using lower bound expressions on the expected data rates. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed optimization algorithm can significantly improve the performance of fairness. It also provides reliable results for uplink communication with imperfect CSIT.</description>

      <title>SuperME: Supervised and Mixture-to-Mixture Co-Learning for Speech Enhancement and Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current dominant approach for neural speech enhancement is based on supervised learning by using simulated training data. The trained models, however, often exhibit limited generalizability to real-recorded data. To address this, we investigate training models directly on real target-domain data, and propose two algorithms, mixture-to-mixture (M2M) training and a co-learning algorithm that improves M2M with the help of supervised algorithms. When paired close-talk and far-field mixtures are available for training, M2M realizes speech enhancement by training a deep neural network (DNN) to produce speech and noise estimates in a way such that they can be linearly filtered to reconstruct the close-talk and far-field mixtures. This way, the DNN can be trained directly on real mixtures, and can leverage close-talk mixtures as a weak supervision to enhance far-field mixtures. To improve M2M, we combine it with supervised approaches to co-train the DNN, where mini-batches of real close-talk and far-field mixture pairs and mini-batches of simulated mixture and clean speech pairs are alternately fed to the DNN, and the loss functions are respectively (a) the mixture reconstruction loss on the real close-talk and far-field mixtures and (b) the regular enhancement loss on the simulated clean speech and noise. We find that, this way, the DNN can learn from real and simulated data to achieve better generalization to real data. We name this algorithm SuperME, $\underline{super}$vised and $\underline{m}$ixture-to-mixtur$\underline{e}$ co-learning. Evaluation results on the CHiME-4 dataset show its effectiveness and potential.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Physical Layer Security in Emerging RF and Optical Wireless Communication Systems: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) has received a growing interest from the research community for its ability to safeguard data confidentiality without relying on key distribution or encryption/decryption. However, the evolution towards the 5G technology and beyond poses new security challenges that must be addressed in order to fulfill the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless networks. Among the potential enabling technologies, RIS has attracted extensive attention due to its ability to proactively and intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment to combat dynamic wireless channel impairments. Consequently, the RIS technology can be adopted to improve the information-theoretic security of both RF and OWC systems. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the information-theoretic security of RIS-based RF and optical systems. The article first discusses the fundamental concepts of PLS and RIS technologies, followed by their combination in both RF and OWC systems. Subsequently, some optimization techniques are presented in the context of the underlying system model, followed by an assessment of the impact of RIS-assisted PLS through a comprehensive performance analysis. Given that the computational complexity of future communication systems that adopt RIS-assisted PLS is likely to increase rapidly as the number of interactions between the users and infrastructure grows, ML is seen as a promising approach to address this complexity issue while sustaining or improving the network performance. A discussion of recent research studies on RIS-assisted PLS-based systems embedded with ML is presented. Furthermore, some important open research challenges are proposed and discussed to provide insightful future research directions, with the aim of moving a step closer towards the development and implementation of the forthcoming 6G wireless technology.</description>

      <title>Tensor Star Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel tensor decomposition framework, termed Tensor Star (TS) decomposition, is proposed which represents a new type of tensor network decomposition based on tensor contractions. This is achieved by connecting the core tensors in a ring shape, whereby the core tensors act as skip connections between the factor tensors and allow for direct correlation characterisation between any two arbitrary dimensions. Uniquely, this makes it possible to decompose an order-$N$ tensor into $N$ order-$3$ factor tensors $\{\mathcal{G}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{N}$ and $N$ order-$4$ core tensors $\{\mathcal{C}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{N}$, which are arranged in a star shape. Unlike the class of Tensor Train (TT) decompositions, these factor tensors are not directly connected to one another. The so obtained core tensors also enable consecutive factor tensors to have different latent ranks. In this way, the TS decomposition alleviates the "curse of dimensionality" and controls the "curse of ranks", exhibiting a storage complexity which scales linearly with the number of dimensions and as the fourth power of the ranks.</description>

      <title>MusicHiFi: Fast High-Fidelity Stereo Vocoding</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly generate music by constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and then converting it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder. Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g., 16-24 kHz), which limits their effectiveness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth expansion, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to previous work, we propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using both objective and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster inference speed compared to past work.

      <title>Lowering Detection in Sport Climbing Based on Orientation of the Sensor Enhanced Quickdraw</title>

Abstract: Tracking climbers' activity to improve services and make the best use of their infrastructure is a concern for climbing gyms. Each climbing session must be analyzed from beginning till lowering of the climber. Therefore, spotting the climbers descending is crucial since it indicates when the ascent has come to an end. This problem must be addressed while preserving privacy and convenience of the climbers and the costs of the gyms. To this aim, a hardware prototype is developed to collect data using accelerometer sensors attached to a piece of climbing equipment mounted on the wall, called quickdraw, that connects the climbing rope to the bolt anchors. The corresponding sensors are configured to be energy-efficient, hence become practical in terms of expenses and time consumption for replacement when using in large quantity in a climbing gym. This paper describes hardware specifications, studies data measured by the sensors in ultra-low power mode, detect sensors' orientation patterns during lowering different routes, and develop an supervised approach to identify lowering.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Localization under Pixel Failures</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) hold great potential as one of the key technological enablers for beyond-5G wireless networks, improving localization and communication performance under line-of-sight (LoS) blockage conditions. However, hardware imperfections might cause RIS elements to become faulty, a problem referred to as pixel failures, which can constitute a major showstopper especially for localization. In this paper, we investigate the problem of RIS-aided localization of a user equipment (UE) under LoS blockage in the presence of RIS pixel failures, considering the challenging single-input single-output (SISO) scenario. We first explore the impact of such failures on accuracy through misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis, which reveals severe performance loss with even a small percentage of pixel failures. To remedy this issue, we develop two strategies for joint localization and failure diagnosis (JLFD) to detect failing pixels while simultaneously locating the UE with high accuracy. The first strategy relies on l_1-regularization through exploitation of failure sparsity. The second strategy detects the failures one-by-one by solving a multiple hypothesis testing problem at each iteration, successively enhancing localization and diagnosis accuracy. Simulation results show significant performance improvements of the proposed JLFD algorithms over the conventional failure-agnostic benchmark, enabling successful recovery of failure-induced performance degradations.</description>

      <title>Joint Computation and Communication Resource Optimization for Beyond Diagonal UAV-IRS Empowered MEC Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 6G systems signal a leap towards universal connectivity and ultra-reliable, low-latency communications for real-time data devices. Yet, these advancements encounter obstacles such as limited device battery life and computational power, along with urban signal blockages. To counter these, Intelligent Reconfigurable Surfaces (IRS) within Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) infrastructures offer enhanced computing to overcome device limitations and create alternative communication paths. Despite these improvements, connectivity issues remain for remote areas. Our paper presents the Beyond Diagonal IRS (BD-IRS or IRS 2.0), integrated with UAVs in MEC networks (BD-IRS-UAV), providing on-demand links for remote users to offload tasks, tackling resource and battery limitations. We propose a joint optimization strategy to reduce system's worst-case latency and UAV hovering time by optimizing BD-IRS-UAV deployment and resource allocation. This challenge is approached by dividing it into two sub-problems: BD-IRS-UAV Placement and Computational Resource Optimization, and Communication Resource Optimization, each solved iteratively. This design significantly enhances system performance, showing a $17.75\%$ increase over traditional diagonal IRS and a $25.43\%$ improvement over IRS on buildings, with a $13.44\%$ enhancement in worst-case latency compared to binary offloading schemes.</description>

      <title>Deep Regularized Compound Gaussian Network for Solving Linear Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating prior information into inverse problems, e.g. via maximum-a-posteriori estimation, is an important technique for facilitating robust inverse problem solutions. In this paper, we devise two novel approaches for linear inverse problems that permit problem-specific statistical prior selections within the compound Gaussian (CG) class of distributions. The CG class subsumes many commonly used priors in signal and image reconstruction methods including those of sparsity-based approaches. The first method developed is an iterative algorithm, called generalized compound Gaussian least squares (G-CG-LS), that minimizes a regularized least squares objective function where the regularization enforces a CG prior. G-CG-LS is then unrolled, or unfolded, to furnish our second method, which is a novel deep regularized (DR) neural network, called DR-CG-Net, that learns the prior information. A detailed computational theory on convergence properties of G-CG-LS and thorough numerical experiments for DR-CG-Net are provided. Due to the comprehensive nature of the CG prior, these experiments show that DR-CG-Net outperforms competitive prior art methods in tomographic imaging and compressive sensing, especially in challenging low-training scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Processing Pipelines for Indoor Human Tracking using FMCW radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of formulating effective processing pipelines for indoor human tracking is investigated, with the usage of a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar. Specifically, two processing pipelines starting with detections on the Range-Azimuth (RA) maps and the Range-Doppler (RD) maps are formulated and compared, together with subsequent clustering and tracking algorithms and their relevant parameters. Experimental results are presented to validate and assess both pipelines, using a 24 GHz commercial radar platform with 250 MHz bandwidth and 15 virtual channels. Scenarios where 1 and 2 people move in an indoor environment are considered, and the influence of the number of virtual channels and detectors' parameters is discussed. The characteristics and limitations of both pipelines are presented, with the approach based on detections on RA maps showing in general more robust results.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Positioning and Attitude Sensing Based on Electromagnetic Propagation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positioning and sensing over wireless networks are imperative for many emerging applications. However, since traditional wireless channel models over-simplify the user equipment (UE) as a point target, they cannot be used for sensing the attitude of the UE, which is typically described by the spatial orientation. In this paper, a comprehensive electromagnetic propagation modeling (EPM) based on electromagnetic theory is developed to precisely model the near-field channel. For the noise-free case, the EPM model establishes the non-linear functional dependence of observed signals on both the position and attitude of the UE. To address the difficulty in the non-linear coupling, we first propose to divide the distance domain into three regions, separated by the defined Phase ambiguity distance and Spacing constraint distance. Then, for each region, we obtain the closed-form solutions for joint position and attitude estimation with low complexity. Next, to investigate the impact of random noise on the joint estimation performance, the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) is derived to yield useful insights. The expected Cram\'er-Rao bound (ECRB) is further provided to obtain the simplified closed-form expressions for the performance lower bounds. Our numerical results demonstrate that the derived ZZB can provide accurate predictions of the performance of estimators in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. More importantly, we achieve the millimeter-level accuracy in position estimation and attain the 0.1-level accuracy in attitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source Channel Coding With Attention Modules Over MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two deep joint source and channel coding (DJSCC) structures with attention modules for the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel, including a serial structure and a parallel structure. With singular value decomposition (SVD)-based precoding scheme, the MIMO channel can be decomposed into various sub-channels, and the feature outputs will experience sub-channels with different channel qualities. In the serial structure, one single network is used at both the transmitter and the receiver to jointly process data streams of all MIMO subchannels, while data steams of different MIMO subchannels are processed independently via multiple sub-networks in the parallel structure. The attention modules in both serial and parallel architectures enable the system to adapt to varying channel qualities and adjust the quantity of information outputs in accordance with the channel qualities. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed DJSCC structures have improved image transmission performance, and reveal the phenomenon via non-parameter entropy estimation that the learned DJSCC transceivers tend to transmit more information over better sub-channels.</description>

      <title>A Conversational Brain-Artificial Intelligence Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Brain-Artificial Intelligence Interfaces (BAIs) as a new class of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Unlike conventional BCIs, which rely on intact cognitive capabilities, BAIs leverage the power of artificial intelligence to replace parts of the neuro-cognitive processing pipeline. BAIs allow users to accomplish complex tasks by providing high-level intentions, while a pre-trained AI agent determines low-level details. This approach enlarges the target audience of BCIs to individuals with cognitive impairments, a population often excluded from the benefits of conventional BCIs. We present the general concept of BAIs and illustrate the potential of this new approach with a Conversational BAI based on EEG. In particular, we show in an experiment with simulated phone conversations that the Conversational BAI enables complex communication without the need to generate language. Our work thus demonstrates, for the first time, the ability of a speech neuroprosthesis to enable fluent communication in realistic scenarios with non-invasive technologies.</description>

      <title>OmniCount: Multi-label Object Counting with Semantic-Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a new, more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging point prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions and heralding a new era in object counting technology.</description>
