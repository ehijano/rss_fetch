      <title>Scattering of Antiplane Shear Waves by Fractals in Strain Gradient Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave manipulation is essential in various applications, including seismic wave protection, sound isolation, and acoustic device design. This study examines the scattering and trapping of antiplane SH waves in a microstructured solid embedded with rigid pins. The material's response is governed by the theory of strain gradient elasticity. A method is proposed for identifying the wavenumbers that induce resonance in the elastic body, based on specific material parameters and pin configurations. The analysis focuses on a system featuring a Koch snowflake-type pin layout, a fractal curve generated through an iterative process. This geometry allows the exploration of a complex arrangement characterized by a high concentration of sharp corners that promote scattering. The system's response to this self-similar configuration is analysed and compared to circular pin arrangements with an equivalent number of pins. A distinct resonance mode is identified, where the motion is trapped within the pin configuration and the conditions for its emergence are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the study explores the influence of the characteristic lengths of the problem that are induced by the dynamic gradient elasticity theory. The findings indicate that in fractal pin arrangements, the system's response is rather dictated by the fractal dimension rather than by the total number of pins, highlighting the significance of geometry in wave propagation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Recursive spectral relations and the charge versus neutral gap in fractional quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum lattice Hamiltonians and derive recursive spectral relations bridging successive particle number sectors. One relation gives conditions under which the charge gap dominates the neutral gap. We verify these conditions under a triad of symmetries (translation-invariance, charge and dipole conservation) that are present, e.g., in periodic fractional quantum Hall systems. Thus, this gap domination, previously observed numerically, is a universal feature imposed by symmetry. A second relation yields a new induction-on-particle-number method for deriving spectral gaps. The results cover both bosons and fermions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian treatment of non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel extension of Hamiltonian mechanics to nonconservative systems built upon the Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley double-variable action principle. Departing from Galley's initial-value action, we clarify important subtleties regarding boundary conditions, the emergence of the physical-limit trajectory, and the decomposition of the Lagrangian into conservative and dissipative sectors. Importantly, we demonstrate that the redundant doubled configuration space admits a gauge freedom at the level of the canonical momenta that leaves the physical dynamics unchanged. From a Legendre transform, we construct the corresponding family of gauge-related nonconservative Hamiltonians; we show that virtually any classical initial-value problem can be embedded on our enlarged symplectic manifold, supplying the associated Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions explicitly. As a further contribution, we derive a completely equivalent linear ``Lie'' formulation of the double-variable action and Hamiltonian which streamlines computations and renders transparent many structural properties of the formalism.</description>

      <title>A connection between quantum dot Dirac operators and $\overline\partial$-Robin Laplacians in the context of shape optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses Faber-Krahn-type inequalities for quantum dot Dirac operators with nonnegative mass on bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that this family of inequalities is equivalent to a family of Faber-Krahn-type inequalities for $\overline\partial$-Robin Laplacians. Thanks to this, we prove them in the case of simply connected domains for quantum dot boundary conditions asymptotically close to zigzag boundary conditions. Finally, we also study the case of negative mass.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectral Methods for Block Copolymer Systems on Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce spectral methods for the Ohta-Kawasaki (OK) and Nakazawa-Ohta (NO) models on a spherical domain, examining their coarsening dynamics and equilibrium pattern formations. We employed the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method for spatial discretization and the second-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF2) scheme for time evolution, resulting in an efficient energy-stable scheme to simulate the OK and NO models on the unit sphere. Our numerical experiments reveal various self-assembled patterns, such as single-bubble assemblies in binary systems and double-bubble and mixed-bubble assemblies in ternary systems. These patterns closely resemble experimental biomembrane patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of the OK model in real-world applications. Additionally, our study explores the relationship between repulsive strength and the number of bubbles in assemblies, confirming the two-thirds law in the OK model. This provides quantitative evidence of how self-assembled patterns depend on system parameters in copolymer systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a method to compute Slavnov overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model using the steepest descent method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. To do so, we employ the Matsuo-Kostov Representation of the Slavnov overlaps to write an integral equation for the respective resolvent, and then represent this equation as a Riemann-Hilbert problem. To demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method by computing the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in the $c\to\infty$ limit, corresponding to free-fermion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement across scales: Quantics tensor trains as a natural framework for renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.</description>

      <title>Stability of laminar monotone shear flows in a channel for high Reynolds number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the stability of a laminar flow $U\in C^4([-1,1])$ in the two-dimensional channel $\mathbb{R} \times[-1,1]$ in the large Reynolds number limit. Assuming that $U$ is strictly monotone but allowing $U^{\prime\prime}$ to vanish, we obtain that if the operator
  $$
  {\mathcal K}_{\nu}=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+\frac{U^{\prime\prime}}{U-\nu} \,, $$ is strictly positive for all $\nu\in\mathbb{R}$ for which $U^{\prime\prime}(U^{-1}(\nu))=0$,then $U$ is stable for sufficiently large Reynolds number. This contribution generalizes previous results mostly by allowing long wave perturbations (but much shorter than the Reynolds number).</description>

      <title>Algebro-geometric integration of the Boussinesq hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an integrable hierarchy of the Boussinesq equation using the Lie-algebraic approach of Holod-Flashka-Newell-Ratiu. We show that finite-gap hamiltonian systems of the hierarchy arise on coadjoint orbits in the loop algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(3)$, and possess spectral curves from the family of $(3,3N\,{+}\,1)$-curves, $N\,{\in}\, \Natural$. Separation of variables leads to the Jacobi inversion problem on the mentioned curves, which is solved in terms of the corresponding multiply periodic functions. An exact finite-gap solution of the Boussinesq equation is obtained explicitly, and a conjecture on the reality conditions is made. The obtained solutions are computed for several spectral curves, and illustrated graphically.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the KMP model to the KPZ equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) process converges to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, as time $t$ goes to infinity, in a properly scaled observation window shifted by $t^{3/4}$. Our proof is based on identifying the KMP process with a stochastic flow of kernels describing transition probabilities in a certain model of random walk in space-time random environment. This allows to apply a recent result of arXiv:2401.06073 proving convergence of the density field of random walks in random environment to the KPZ equation in a suitably general sense.</description>

      <title>Infinite Dimensional Mean-Field Belavkin Equation: Well-posedness and Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the mean-field limit of a stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation arising in quantum optimal control and mean-field games, where N interacting particles undergo continuous indirect measurement. For the open quantum system described by Belavkin's filtering equation, we derive a mean-field approximation under minimal assumptions, extending prior results limited to bounded operators and finitedimensional settings. By establishing global well-posedness via fixed-point methods-avoiding measure-change techniques-we obtain higher regularity solutions. Furthermore, we prove rigorous convergence to the mean-field limit in an infinitedimensional framework. Our work provides the first derivation of such limits for wave functions in $L^2 (R^d)$, with implications for simulating and controlling large quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dirac points annihilation and its obstruction characterized by Euler number and quaternionic charges in kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phenomenon of Dirac point annihilation and its obstruction in three-band, real symmetric Hamiltonians with time-reversal symmetry, and their relation to the Euler number, a well-known topological invariant. For this purpose, we study the example of the kagome lattice using a simple tight-binding model. By tuning the parameters of the lattice continuously, we illustrate situations where two Dirac points are able to annihilate, and others, where this annihilation is topologically obstructed. For a system with no gaps between the three bands, like in the kagome lattice, the Euler number of two bands is ill-defined on the whole Brillouin zone, which requires the introduction of the so-called ``patch" Euler number on a subregion without additional degeneracies coming from the third band. A non-zero patch Euler number means that the annihilation of the Dirac points is impossible. We also illustrate another point of view, using homotopy theory, associating the Dirac points with quaternionic charges. We prove that the non-abelian braiding of the Dirac points in k-space conjugates their quaternionic charge and explains the possible obstruction to the annihilation of Dirac points. Finally, we show that the proposed deformation of the kagome lattice can be achieved in realistic photonic systems.</description>

Abstract: We study a percolation model on $\mathbb R^d$ called the random connection model. For $d$ large, we use the lace expansion to prove that the critical two-point connection probability decays like $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ as $|x| \to \infty$, with possible anisotropic decay. Our proof also applies to nearest-neighbour Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb Z^d$ in $d \ge 11$ and simplifies considerably the proof given by Hara in 2008. The method is based on the recent deconvolution strategy of Liu and Slade and uses an $L^p$ version of Hara's induction argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a noncommutative algebra $A$ and an antilinear automorphism $\rho$ of $A$ there is a notion of a positive trace. Positive traces appear in study of supersymmetric gauge theories. We classify positive traces on $A$ in two cases. The first case is when $A$ is a quantization of a Kleinian singularity of type $D$, with certain restriction on the quantization parameter. The second case is when $A=K^{\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}[[t]])\rtimes \mathbb{C}_q^{\times}}(\operatorname{Gr}_{\operatorname{PGL}_2})$ is an algebra containing $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches of pure $\operatorname{SL}(2)$ and $\operatorname{PGL}(2)$ gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: We determine the principal term of the asymptotics of the integrated density of states (IDS) $N(\lambda)$ for the Schr\"odinger operator with point interactions on $\mathbf{R}^3$ as $\lambda \to -\infty$, provided that the set of positions of the point obstacles is the Poisson configuration, and the interaction parameters are bounded i.i.d.\ random variables. In particular, we prove $N(\lambda) =O(|\lambda|^{-3/2})$ as $\lambda\to -\infty$. In the case that all interaction parameters are equal to a constant, we give a more detailed asymptotics of $N(\lambda)$, and verify the result by a numerical method using R.</description>

Abstract: We construct a thermodynamic limit for the grand canonical Bose gas in dimension $d\geqslant1$ (in its Feynman-Kac representation) with superstable interaction at any inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and any chemical potential $\mu\in\RR$. Our infinite volume model is naturally a distribution over configurations of finite loops and possibly interlacements. We prove the limiting process to solve a new class of DLR equations involving random permutations and Brownian paths.</description>

      <title>Irreversible dynamics on Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric construction of irreversible dynamics on Poisson manifolds that satisfies the axioms of metriplectic mechanics and the GENERIC framework. Our approach relies solely on the underlying Poisson structure and its deformation theory, without requiring any additional metric structure. Specifically, we show that if the second Lichnerowicz-Poisson cohomology group of a Poisson manifold is nontrivial, one can construct a symmetric bracket that generates irreversible dynamics compatible with energy conservation and entropy production. This bracket is derived from a 2-cocycle that deforms the original Poisson structure, thereby modifying the associated Casimir foliation. We illustrate the construction with two finite-dimensional examples, the duals of the Lie algebras of the special Euclidean group SE(2) and the Galilei group SGal(3). These examples demonstrate the applicability of the method in classical mechanics, control theory, and mathematical physics. Our framework naturally extends to infinite-dimensional settings, which are discussed as directions for future work.</description>

      <title>A boostlet transform for wave-based acoustic signal processing in space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse representation systems that encode signal architecture have had a profound impact on sampling and compression paradigms. Remarkable examples are multi-scale directional systems, which, similar to our vision system, encode the underlying architecture of natural images with sparse features. Inspired by this philosophy, we introduce a representation system for wave-based acoustic signal processing in 2D space--time, referred to as the \emph{boostlet transform}, which encodes sparse features of natural acoustic fields using the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations. Boostlets are spatiotemporal functions parametrized with dilations, Lorentz boosts, and translations in space--time. Physically speaking, boostlets are supported away from the acoustic radiation cone, i.e., having broadband frequency with phase velocities other than the speed of sound, resulting in a peculiar scaling function. We formulate a discrete boostlet frame using Meyer wavelets and bump functions and examine its sparsity properties. An analysis with experimentally measured fields indicates that discrete boostlet coefficients decay significantly faster and attain superior reconstruction performance than wavelets, curvelets, shearlets, and wave atoms. The results demonstrate that boostlets provide a natural, compact representation system for acoustic waves in space-time.</description>

      <title>A solution of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the generalised quantum Stein's lemma, proving that the Stein exponent associated with entanglement testing, namely, the quantum hypothesis testing task of distinguishing between $n$ copies of an entangled state $\rho_{AB}$ and a generic separable state $\sigma_{A^n:B^n}$, equals the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of all quantum resource theories under asymptotically resource non-generating operations, with the regularised relative entropy of resource governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. As a by-product, we prove that the same Stein exponent can also be achieved when the null hypothesis is only approximately i.i.d., in the sense that it can be modelled by an 'almost power state'. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call 'blurring', which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. Blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein's lemma in the fully classical case, but not in the quantum case. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.</description>

      <title>SVM/SVR Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants from projective bundles on smooth log Calabi-Yau pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,E)$ be a smooth log Calabi-Yau pair consisting of a smooth Fano surface $X$ and a smooth anticanonical divisor $E$. We obtain certain higher genus local Gromov-Witten invariants from the projectivization of the canonical bundle $Z := \mathbb{P}(K_X \oplus \mathcal{O}_X)$, using the degeneration formula for stable log maps [KLR]. We evaluate an invariant in the degeneration using the relationship between $q$-refined tropical curve counting and logarithmic Gromov-Witten theory with $\lambda_g$-insertion [Bou]. As a corollary, we use flops to prove a blow up formula for higher genus invariants of $Z$. Additionally assuming $X$ is toric, we prove an all-genus correspondence between open invariants of an outer Aganagic-Vafa brane $L \subset K_X$ and closed invariants of $Z$ that generalizes a genus-0 open-closed equality of [Cha] to all-genus, by using an argument in [GRZZ].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a marginally unstable photon sphere in a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularity spacetime. Using the Picard-Fuchs equation, we derive full-order power series expressions for the deflection angle in various regimes, including the strong deflection limits from both outside and inside the photon sphere. We show that the deflection angle diverges non-logarithmically in both cases, refining existing asymptotic formulae. Comparing truncated approximations with numerical results, we find that higher-order corrections are essential to achieve comparable accuracy to logarithmic divergence cases. Using these improved formulae, we also derive precise approximations for image positions that are not restricted to the almost perfectly aligned cases.</description>

      <title>Time-of-Flow Distributions in Discrete Quantum Systems: From Operational Protocols to Quantum Speed Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general and experimentally accessible framework to quantify transition timing in discrete quantum systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Defined from the rate of population change in a target state, the TF distribution can be reconstructed through repeated projective measurements at discrete times on independently prepared systems, thus avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-of-departure (TOD) distribution. We apply this approach to optimize time-dependent Hamiltonians, analyze shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) protocols, and derive a transition-based quantum speed limit (TF-QSL) for both closed and open quantum systems. We also establish a lower bound on temporal uncertainty and examine decoherence effects, demonstrating the versatility of the TF framework for quantum control and diagnostics. This method provides both a conceptual tool and an experimental protocol for probing and engineering quantum dynamics in discrete-state platforms.</description>

      <title>Explicit noise and dissipation operators for quantum stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems plays a fundamental role in several scientific and technological disciplines, from quantum computing and information science to molecular electronics and quantum thermodynamics. Despite its widespread relevance, a rigorous formulation of quantum dissipation in conjunction with thermal noise remains a topic of active research. In this work, we establish a formal correspondence between classical stochastic thermodynamics, in particular the Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations, and the quantum master equation. Building on prior studies of multiplicative noise in classical stochastic differential equations, we demonstrate that thermal noise at the quantum level manifests as a multidimensional geometric stochastic process. By applying canonical quantization, we introduce a novel Hermitian dissipation operator that serves as a quantum analogue of classical viscous friction. This operator allows for a well-defined expression of heat exchange between a system and its environment, enabling the formulation of an alternative quantum equipartition theorem. Our framework ensures a precise energy balance that aligns with the first law of thermodynamics and an entropy balance consistent with the second law. The theoretical formalism is applied to two prototypical quantum systems, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in an infinite potential well, for which it provides new insights into nonequilibrium thermodynamics at the quantum scale. Our results advance the understanding of dissipation in quantum systems and establish a foundation for future studies on stochastic thermodynamics in the quantum domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noether: A Covariant Study of Poisson-Lie Symmetries in Low Dimensional Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or ``covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory (FTPFT) perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time $t=0$ are as follows: (1) their Fourier transform $f(p)$ is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at $p=0$ and possibly others with $\Im (p) &lt; 0$; and (2) $f(p)/p$ converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. A prototypical function of this class is $\tanh(\eta t)$, to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching at time $t=0$. In the limit of large $\eta$, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behavior of Loschmidt echo (LE) that emerges in an exponentially short time scale, our previous results for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by the resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long-time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behavior exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.</description>

Abstract: We identify a special class of multi-species spin glass models: ones in which the species proportions serve to ''balance'' out the interaction strengths. For this class, we prove a free energy lower bound that does not require any convexity assumption, and applies to both Ising and spherical models. The lower bound is the free energy of a single-species model whose $p$-spin inverse-temperature parameter is exactly the variance of the $p$-spin component of the multi-species Hamiltonian. For the Ising case, this generalizes an inequality recently found by Issa in the context of vector spin models. We further demonstrate that this lower bound is actually an equality in many cases, including: at high temperatures for all models, at all temperatures for convex models, and at zero temperature for pure bipartite spherical models. When translated to a statement about the injective norm of a nonsymmetric Gaussian tensor, our lower bound matches an upper bound recently established by Dartois and McKenna.</description>

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the proof of a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of subLaplacians on contact metric manifolds, under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. To do so, we rely on a semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus developed for general filtered manifolds that we specialize to the setting of contact manifolds. Our strategy is then reminiscent of an implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as we rely on the construction of microlocal projectors in our calculus which commute with the subLaplacian, called Landau projectors. The subLaplacian is then shown to act effectively on the range of each Landau projector as the Reeb vector field does. The remainder of the proof follows the classical path towards QE, once microlocal Weyl laws have been established.</description>
