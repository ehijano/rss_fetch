      <title>Stable sheaf cohomology and Koszul--Ringel duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a close relationship between stable sheaf cohomology for polynomial functors applied to the cotangent bundle on projective space, and Koszul--Ringel duality on the category of strict polynomial functors as described in the work of Cha\l upnik, Krause, and Touz\'e. Combining this with recent results of Maliakas--Stergiopoulou we confirm a conjectured periodicity statement for stable cohomology. In a different direction, we find a remarkable invariance property for $\Ext$ groups between Schur functors associated to hook partitions, and compute all such extension groups over a field of arbitrary characteristic. We show that this is further equivalent to the calculation of $\Ext$ groups for partitions with $2$ rows (or $2$ columns), and as such it relates to Parker's recursive description of $\Ext$ groups for $\SL_2$-representations. Finally, we give a general sharp bound for the interval of degrees where stable cohomology of a Schur functor can be non-zero.</description>

Abstract: We study the q-characters and modular data of exceptional W-algebras and give several examples and applications. We establish equality of q-characters and modular data between certain boundary W-algebras, leading in particular to a largely complete determination of fusion rules of exceptional W-algebras in type A.</description>

      <title>Multi-Qubit Golden Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to construct optimal topological generators for compact unitary Lie groups, extending the work of a letter of Sarnak and arXiv:1704.02106 on golden and super-golden gates to higher dimensions. To do so we consider a variant of the Sarnak--Xue Density Hypotheses in the weight aspect for definite projective unitary groups and prove it using the endoscopic classification of automorphic representations.
  Our main motivation is to construct efficient multi-qubit universal gate sets for quantum computers. For example, we find a set of universal gates that, for a given accuracy, can heuristically approximate arbitrary unitary operations on 2 qubits with $\approx$10 times fewer ``expensive'' $T$-type gates than the standard Clifford+$T$ set. Our framework also covers the 2-qubit Clifford+CS gate set, well-known for being particularly friendly to fault-tolerant implementation. We thereby prove tight upper bounds on the required CS count for approximations (specifically, $4.8$x fewer non-Clifford gates than Clifford+$T$).</description>

      <title>The Negation Of Singer's Conjecture For The Sixth Algebraic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$</description>

      <title>On Lagrangian formulations for (ir)reducible mixed-antisymmetric higher integer spin fields in Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau $Y[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\hat{s}_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with 3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices $\Phi_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}_3}]}$ on a basis of the
  BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q_c$, BRST operators. We found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q_c$ and off-shell BRST invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.</description>

Abstract: Let G be a connected reductive group defined over a non-archimedean local field of characteristic 0. We assume G is quasi-split, adjoint and absolutly simple. Let g be the Lie algebra of G. We consider the space of the invariant distributions on g(F), which are stable and supported by the set of nilpotent elements of g(F). Magdy Assem has stated several conjectures which describe this space. We prove some of these conjectures, assuming that the residual characteristic of F is ''very large'' relatively to G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}:=\mathcal{C}(G,\omega,H,\psi)$ be a finite group scheme-theoretical category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p\ge 0$ as defined by the first author. For any indecomposable exact module category over $\mathcal{C}$, we classify its simple objects and provide an expression for their projective covers in terms of double cosets and projective representations of certain closed subgroup schemes of $G$. This upgrades a result of Ostrik for group-theoretical fusion categories in characteristic $0$, and generalizes our previous work for the case $\omega=1$. As a byproduct, we describe the simples and indecomposable projectives of $\mathcal{C}$. Finally, we apply our results to describe the blocks of the center of ${\rm Coh}(G,\omega)$.</description>

      <title>On the source algebra equivalence class of blocks with cyclic defect groups, II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks.
  To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of $\mathbf{B}$, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class. In Parts II-IV of our series of papers, we classify, for odd $p$, those endo-permutation modules of cyclic $p$-groups arising from $p$-blocks of quasisimple groups.
  In the present Part II, we reduce the desired classification for the quasisimple classical groups of Lie type $B$, $C$, and $D$ to the corresponding objective for the general linear and unitary groups; the classification is completed for the latter groups.</description>

      <title>Representation of tensor functions using lower-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</description>

      <title>On the structure of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ in odd characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the homological properties of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ over a field $k$ of positive characteristic $p$, focusing on their interplay with the representation theory of quotients of group algebras of symmetric groups via Schur-Weyl duality. Schur-Weyl duality establishes that the centraliser algebra, $\Lambda(p, 2p)$, of the tensor space $(k^p)^{\otimes 2p}$ (as a module over $S(p, 2p)$) is a quotient of the group algebra of the symmetric group. In this paper, we prove that Schur-Weyl duality between $S(p, 2p)$ and $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is an instance of an Auslander-type correspondence.
  We compute the global dimension of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ and their relative dominant dimension with respect to the tensor space $(k^p)^{\otimes 2p}$. In particular, we show that the pair $(S(p, 2p), (k^p)^{\otimes 2p})$ forms a relative $4(p-1)$-Auslander pair in the sense of Cruz and Psaroudakis, thereby connecting Schur algebras with higher homological algebra. Moreover, we determine the Hemmer-Nakano dimension associated with the quasi-hereditary cover of $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ that arises from Schur-Weyl duality. As an application, we show that the direct sum of some Young modules over $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is a full tilting module when $p&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Semisimplifying categorical Heisenberg actions and periodic equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically apply semisimplification functors in modular representation theory. Motivated by the Duflo--Serganova functor in Lie superalgebras, we construct various functors of interest. In the setting of finite groups, we refine the cyclic group Brauer construction and categorify the Glauberman correspondence. In the setting of degenerate categorical Heisenberg actions, we obtain a rich collection of functors which commute with the categorical action. Applied to well-known categorifications of the basic representation and Fock space, our functors give explicit realizations of periodic equivalences for polynomial functors and symmetric groups first studied by Henke-Koenig. This allows us to globalize the equivalences of Henke-Koenig by symmetric monoidal functors. We apply these results to deduce branching properties of certain modular representations of $S_n$.</description>

      <title>On the third and fourth Betti numbers of a homogeneous space of a Lie group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper "The second cohomology of nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras, Kyoto J. Math. 60 (2020), no. 2, 717-799" by I. Biswas, P. Chatterjee, and C. Maity, explicit descriptions of the second and first real de Rham cohomology groups of a general homogeneous space of a Lie group are given, extending an earlier result in "On the exactness of Kostant-Kirillov form and the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits, Internat. J. Math. 23 (2012), no. 8, 1250086" by I. Biswas and P. Chatterjee. From the computational viewpoint, they turned out to be new and very useful, and in fact played a crucial role in determining the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits as done in the above two papers. In this paper, we give computable and explicit descriptions of the third and fourth real de Rham cohomologies of a general homogeneous space, in terms of the associated Lie-theoretic data, along the lines mentioned above. We also draw numerous corollaries of our main results in important special settings. Moreover, as a consequence, we obtain a new and interesting invariant by showing that for a large class of homogeneous spaces, the difference between the third and fourth Betti numbers coincides with the difference between the numbers of simple factors of the ambient group and the associated closed subgroup.</description>

      <title>Modular invariance groups and defect McKay-Thompson series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known since 1992 that the McKay-Thompson series $T_g(q)$ of the Moonshine module form Hauptmoduln for genus zero subgroups of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. In 2021, Lin and Shao constructed a series analogous to the McKay-Thompson series (a twined partition function of the Monster CFT), but using a non-invertible topological defect rather than an element of the Monster group $\mathcal{M}$. This "defect McKay-Thompson series" was found to be invariant under a genus zero subgroup of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, but was shown not to be the Hauptmodul of the subgroup. Nevertheless, one might wonder if a weaker version of Borcherds' theorem holds for non-invertible defects: perhaps defect McKay-Thompson series enjoy genus zero invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, whether or not they are Hauptmoduln for those groups. Using the decompositions of the monster stress tensor found in Bae et al. (2021), we construct several new defect McKay-Thompson series, study their modular properties, and determine their invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. We discover that many of the invariance groups are not genus zero.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory. I. Component lattices of stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series on intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory, where we develop a new framework for enumerative geometry that allows the generalization of constructions and results from linear moduli stacks to general non-linear algebraic stacks.
  In this paper, we introduce the component lattice of an algebraic stack. This is a key object in our theory, defined using the formalism of stacks of graded and filtered points. It provides the combinatorial data needed to formulate various results in enumerative geometry, such as decomposition-type theorems and wall-crossing formulae. Later papers in the series will focus on extending Donaldson-Thomas theory to the non-linear case, and we expect that our approach will be useful for extending many other flavours of enumerative invariants beyond the linear case as well.
  This paper proves several foundational results of our framework. The first is the constancy theorem, which states that the isomorphism types of connected components of the stacks of graded and filtered points stay constant within chambers in the component lattice. The second is the finiteness theorem, which provides a criterion for the finiteness of the number of possible isomorphism types of these components. The third is the associativity theorem, generalizing the structure of Hall algebras from linear stacks to general stacks.
  We also discuss some applications of these results outside Donaldson-Thomas theory, including a construction of stacks of real-weighted filtrations, and a generalization of the semistable reduction theorem to real-weighted filtrations.</description>

Abstract: Using Mackey functors, we provide a general framework for classifying torsors of algebraic tori in terms of Brauer groups of finite field extensions of the base field. This generalizes Blunk's description of the tori associated to del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6 to all retract rational tori, essentially the largest class for which this is possible.</description>

      <title>Global fluctuations for standard Young tableaux</title>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Young generating function for a probability measure on integer partitions. We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$. In all cases, we identify the limiting fluctuations as a conditioned Gaussian Free Field.</description>
