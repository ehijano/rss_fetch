      <title>Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine space-filling curves, which are surjective continuous maps from $[0,1]$ to some higher-dimensional space, usually the unit square $[0,1]^2$. In particular, we define Peano's curve and Lebesgue's curve, and state some of their properties. We also discuss the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem, which characterizes those subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are the image of a space-filling curve. Finally, we discuss real-world applications of Hilbert curves, in particular Google's $S2$ Cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this arxiv-post I present my solutions (published or not) to Problems that appeared in Amer. Math. Monthly, Math. Magazine, Elemente der Mathematik and CRUX, that were mostly done in collaboration with Rudolf Rupp. Some of them (including a few own proposals which were published) were also done in cooperation with Rainer Br\"uck, Bikash Chakraborty, Pamela Gorkin, Gerd Herzog, J\'er\^ome No\"el, Peter Pflug and Amol Sasane.</description>

      <title>From Concrete to Abstract in Indian Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the extensive amount of scholarly work done on Indian mathematics in the last 200 years, the conditions under which it originated and evolved is still not clear. Often, one reads the ancient texts with the present concepts and methods in mind. The fact of absence of script over a long stretch of Indian history in ancient times also gets overlooked in such readings. The purpose of this article is to explore the journey of mathematics by examining what the ancient texts tell us about the nature of mathematics in their times. What one finds from the investigation of arithmetic, geometry and algebra is that while it was concrete and context bound, rooted in solving practical problems in ancient times, Indian mathematics transitioned to context free, abstract stage with the advent of algebra supported by writing.</description>
