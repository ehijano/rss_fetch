      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general system of ODEs and associated explicit solutions in a special case for geodesics between full rank matrices in the deep linear network geometry. In the process, we characterize all horizontal straight lines in the invariant balanced manifold that remain geodesics under Riemannian submersion.</description>

      <title>On nondegenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic $1$-forms with shrinking branching sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a gluing theorem for non-degenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic $1$-forms on compact manifolds, in which non-degenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic $1$-forms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are glued to the regular zeros of a non-degenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic $1$-form. As an immediate consequence, viewing an ordinary harmonic $1$-form as a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic $1$-form without branching set, we prove that for every compact manifold $M^{n}, n\geq 3$, if the first Betti number $b^{1}(M)&gt;0$, then $M$ admits a family of non-degenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic $1$-forms, which resolves a folklore conjecture. We will also discuss several possible applications to special holonomy, in particular, to the field of $G_{2}$-geometry.</description>

      <title>Fenchel-Willmore and Sobolev-type inequalities for submanifolds in non-negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we uncover a novel connection between the Fenchel-Willmore inequality and a new logarithmic Sobolev inequality for mean-convex submanifolds immersed in non-negatively curved manifolds with Euclidean volume growth. Building on this connection, we establish extensions of the Fenchel-Willmore inequality to submanifolds with boundary and to complete non-compact submanifolds. In addition, we derive a sharp Sobolev-type inequality for submanifolds in the same setting. These Sobolev-type inequalities admit a number of applications, including topological consequences in the surface case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the weak inverse anisotropic mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first establish a local gradient estimate for anisotropic $p$-harmonic functions. A key feature of our estimate is that the constant remains bounded as $p\to 1$; consequently, in the limit $p\to 1$, this estimate yields the local gradient estimate for weak solutions of the inverse anisotropic mean curvature flow (IAMCF). As an application, we show that the weak IAMCF is asymptotic to the expanding Wulff shape solution at the infinity, thereby extending the result of Huisken and Ilmanen in [7] to the anisotropic case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically flat black holes with a singular Cauchy horizon and a spacelike singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$ near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike singularities. Our main results include:
  _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical black hole.
  _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field equations.
  In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity $\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$.
  Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this phenomenon is conjecturally generic for the Einstein-scalar-field model, even beyond spherical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Computations regarding the torsion homology of Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the torsion homology behaviour in towers of Oeljeklaus-Toma (OT) manifolds. This adapts an idea of Silver and Williams from knot theory to OT-manifolds and extends it to higher degree homology groups. In the case of surfaces, i.e. Inoue surfaces of type $S^0$, the torsion grows exponentially in both $H_1$ (as was established by Braunling) and $H_2$ (our result) according to a parameter which already plays a role in Inoue's classical paper, and we obtain that the torsion vanishes in all higher degrees. This motivates our presented machine calculations for OT-manifolds of higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian surfaces with harmonic mean curvature in complex space forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian surfaces in complex space forms whose mean curvature is a harmonic function. We prove that if the mean curvature is non-zero constant, then the second fundamental form is parallel. In the non-constant mean curvature case, under the condition of constant Gaussian curvature, we give an explicit description of all such surfaces.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying geometric structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized symmetries and constraints, as demonstrated in several examples, including exterior covariant derivatives, linearized prescribed Riemann curvature, and linearized Einstein equations with sources.</description>

      <title>On Topology and Geometry of Hessian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a differentiable manifold $M$, a pair $(M, \nabla)$ is termed an affine manifold, if $\nabla$ is a flat and torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle $TM\rightarrow M$. A Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ is called a Hessian metric on affine manifold $(M, \nabla)$, if $g$ can be expressed locally as the Hessian quadratic form of some smooth potential $f$. An affine manifold equipped with a Hessian metric is termed a Hessian manifold. We study the topology and geometry of Hessian manifolds.
  Key topological constraints are derived, including the vanishing of the Euler characteristic for any compact Hessian manifold and the proof that its fundamental group must be infinite and torsion-free. We demonstrate that compact Hessian manifolds with an abelian fundamental group are homeomorphic to the flat torus. The theory of flat line bundles is developed to introduce the canonical and obstruction bundles, which are used to prove that a curved compact orientable Hessian manifold must be a mapping torus.
  A Hessian manifold $((M, \nabla),g)$ is said to be of Koszul type, if there exists a $1$-form $\eta\in\Omega^1(M)$ such that $g=\nabla\eta$. We place emphasis on Hessian manifolds of Koszul type, establishing an equivalence between their existence and that of positive flat line bundles, space-like Lagrangian immersions, and hyperbolic affine structures. A duality with radiant manifolds, analogous to the classical Legendre transformation, is explored. We also construct a non-trivial family of compact Hessian manifolds of Koszul type with negative scalar curvature, and classify all complete Hessian surfaces.</description>

      <title>A Penrose-type inequality for static spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the total mass of the time slices of (n + 1)-dimensional asymptotically flat standard static spacetimes under the timelike convergence condition. The inequality can be viewed equivalently as a Minkowski-type inequality in these spaces, i.e. as a lower bound on the total mean curvature of the boundary, and thus extends inequalities from [3], [22], [19], and [10]. Equality is achieved only by slices of Schwarzschild space and is related to the characterization of quasi-spherical static vacuum metrics from [10]. As a notable special case of the main inequality, we obtain the Riemannian Penrose inequality in all dimensions for static spaces under the TCC.</description>

      <title>Cancellation properties for exotic $4$-dimensional positive scalar curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ruberman constructed families $\{g_n\vert n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{R}^+ (M)$ of metrics of positive scalar curvature on certain $4$-manifolds which are concordant but lie in different path components of $\mathcal{R}^+ (M)$. We prove a cancellation result along the following lines. For each closed manifold $N$, there is a map $\nu_N: \mathcal{R}^+ (M) \to \mathcal{R}^+ (M \times N)$, well-defined up to homotopy, that takes the product with $N$. We prove that when $N$ has positive dimension $\nu_N$ takes all metrics of Ruberman's family to the same path component. This is trivial when $N$ has a psc metric and follows from pseudoisotopy theory when $\dim (N) \geq 3$. Our proof is cobordism theoretic in nature and also applies to $\dim(N) =1,2$. The proof relies on rigidity properties for the action of the diffeomorphism group on $\mathcal{R}^+(L)$ for high-dimensional $N$ and a calculation of $\pi_1(\mathrm{MTSO(4)})$ that we also carry out.
  Recently, Auckly and Ruberman exhibited examples of elements in higher homotopy groups of $\mathcal{R}^+(M^4)$ for certain $M$. Using the same method, we also prove that these elements lie in the kernel of the induced map $(\nu_N)_*$ on rational homotopy.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness in Mean Curvature Flow: Non-canonical solutions via the parabolic Allen--Cahn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When mean curvature flow evolves non-uniquely, the flow is said to fatten. The work of Ilmanen shows that any weak MCF is supported inside the fattening, and work of Hershkovits--White identified canonical weak flows supported on the boundary of the fattening, known as the outermost flows. It is natural to ask, when the flow fattens, are there weak mean curvature flows supported strictly inside the fattening? Outside of some special cases (e.g. flow from cones), this question was entirely open. We show these interior flows exist, providing a general construction for non-outermost flows as limits of solutions to the parabolic $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn. This gives the first examples of closed, non-trivial, non-canonical, integral Brakke motions. As part of this construction, we study the $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn flow from low regularity initial data, and our results demonstrate the existence of integral Brakke motions from fractal sets. This includes the existence portion of Hershkovits's work on mean curvature flow from Reifenberg sets.</description>
