      <title>Leveraging generative artificial intelligence for simulation-based physics experiments: A new approach to virtual learning about the real world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of a novel application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in physics instruction: engaging students in prompting, refining, and validating AI-constructed simulations of physical phenomena. In a second-semester physics course for life science majors, we conducted a comparative study of three instructional approaches in a laboratory focused on electric potentials: (i) students using physical equipment, (ii) students using a prebuilt simulator, and (iii) students using AI to generate a simulation. We found significant group differences in performance on conceptual assessments of the laboratory content ({\eta}^2 = 0.359). Post-hoc analysis showed that students in both the AI-generated and prebuilt simulation conditions scored significantly higher on the conceptual assessments than students in the physical equipment condition. Students in these groups also reported more favorable perceptions of the learning experience. Finally, this preliminary study highlights opportunities for developing students' modeling skills through the processes of designing, refining, and validating AI-generated simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Physics Teachers' Views on Physics Education Research: A Case of Science Scepticism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gap between theory and practice is well-documented in educational research. Physics teachers' willingness to apply research findings in practice may be influenced by a sceptical attitude towards science education research. This study explores physics teachers' perspectives on science education research, with a particular focus on potential scepticism towards the discipline. A two-step mixed-methods approach was employed: (1) Interviews with a purposeful sample of 13 experienced physics teachers for a first exploration of attitudes towards physics education research, and (2) a quantitative survey of 174 physics teachers to examine, among other aspects, the previously observed attitudes in a larger sample and to identify teacher profiles using latent profile analysis. The interview study revealed both sceptical and non-sceptical attitudes towards physics education research, including some that fundamentally questioned its practical value. Based on the survey data and latent profile analysis, four distinct teacher profiles differing in their level of scepticism towards science education research were identified. While one profile is highly sceptical, the other three exhibit a mix of sceptical and supportive attitudes. Thus, physics teachers are not generally sceptical. However, the cooperation between research and practice is perceived as unproductive by most teachers.</description>

      <title>Case study examining graduate student sensemaking using the epistemic game framework for Laplace's equation in upper-level electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This case study used individual interviews to investigate graduate student sense-making in upper-level electrostatics in the context of problems that can be efficiently solved for the electric potential using Laplace's equation. Although there are many technical mathematical issues involved in solving Laplace's equation, the focus of this research is not on those issues. Instead, the focus is on structural issues such as whether students recognize when solving Laplace's equation would be an effective approach to finding the potential and set up the problems correctly, and whether they can draw the electric field lines and equipotential surfaces in a given situation. Although many prior investigations have shed light on student sensemaking in the introductory physics contexts, very few investigations have focused on graduate student sensemaking while solving advanced physics problems. We present the findings of our research which was conducted through the lens of the epistemic game framework proposed by Tuminaro and Redish. We observe different nested epistemic games played by students.</description>
