      <title>Reachability in Vector Addition System with States Parameterized by Geometric Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric dimension of a Vector Addition System with States (VASS), emerged in Leroux and Schmitz (2019) and formalized by Fu, Yang, and Zheng (2024), quantifies the dimension of the vector space spanned by cycle effects in the system. This paper explores the VASS reachability problem through the lens of geometric dimension, revealing key differences from the traditional dimensional parameterization. Notably, we establish that the reachability problem for both geometrically 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional VASS is PSPACE-complete, achieved by extending the pumping technique originally proposed by Czerwi\'nski et al. (2019).</description>

      <title>Towards Provable Security in Industrial Control Systems Via Dynamic Protocol Attestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICSs) increasingly rely on digital technologies vulnerable to cyber attacks. Cyber attackers can infiltrate ICSs and execute malicious actions. Individually, each action seems innocuous. But taken together, they cause the system to enter an unsafe state. These attacks have resulted in dramatic consequences such as physical damage, economic loss, and environmental catastrophes. This paper introduces a methodology that restricts actions using protocols. These protocols only allow safe actions to execute. Protocols are written in a domain specific language we have embedded in an interactive theorem prover (ITP). The ITP enables formal, machine-checked proofs to ensure protocols maintain safety properties. We use dynamic attestation to ensure ICSs conform to their protocol even if an adversary compromises a component. Since protocol conformance prevents unsafe actions, the previously mentioned cyber attacks become impossible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology using an example from the Fischertechnik Industry 4.0 platform. We measure dynamic attestation's impact on latency and throughput. Our approach is a starting point for studying how to combine formal methods and protocol design to thwart attacks intended to cripple ICSs.</description>

      <title>Tokenisation is NP-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the NP-completeness of two variants of tokenisation, defined as the problem of compressing a dataset to at most $\delta$ symbols by either finding a vocabulary directly (direct tokenisation), or selecting a sequence of merge operations (bottom-up tokenisation).</description>

      <title>An automata-based approach for synchronizable mailbox communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06968v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit finite-state communicating systems with round-based communication under mailbox semantics. Mailboxes correspond to one FIFO buffer per process (instead of one buffer per pair of processes in peer-to-peer systems). Round-based communication corresponds to sequences of rounds in which processes can first send messages, then only receive (and receives must be in the same round as their sends). A system is called synchronizable if every execution can be re-scheduled into an equivalent execution that is a sequence of rounds. Previous work mostly considered the setting where rounds have fixed size. Our main contribution shows that the problem whether a mailbox communication system complies with the round-based policy, with no size limitation on rounds, is Pspace-complete. For this we use a novel automata-based approach, that also allows to determine the precise complexity (Pspace) of several questions considered in previous literature.</description>
