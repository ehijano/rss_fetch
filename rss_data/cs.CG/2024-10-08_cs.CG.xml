      <title>Identification of Anomalous Geospatial Trajectories via Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for analyzing geospatial trajectory data using topological data analysis (TDA) to identify a specific class of anomalies, commonly referred to as crop circles, in AIS data. This approach is the first of its kind to be applied to spatiotemporal data. By embedding $2+1$-dimensional spatiotemporal data into $\mathbb{R}^3$, we utilize persistent homology to detect loops within the trajectories in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our research reveals that, under normal conditions, trajectory data embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ over time do not form loops. Consequently, we can effectively identify anomalies characterized by the presence of loops within the trajectories. This method is robust and capable of detecting loops that are invariant to small perturbations, variations in geometric shape, and local coordinate projections. Additionally, our approach provides a novel perspective on anomaly detection, offering enhanced sensitivity and specificity in identifying atypical patterns in geospatial data. This approach has significant implications for various applications, including maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.</description>

      <title>Fast Area-Weighted Peeling of Convex Hulls for Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel 2D convex hull peeling algorithm for outlier detection, which repeatedly removes the point on the hull that decreases the hull's area the most. To find k outliers among n points, one simply peels k points. The algorithm is an efficient heuristic for exact methods, which find the k points whose removal together results in the smallest convex hull. Our algorithm runs in O(nlogn) time using O(n) space for any choice of k. This is a significant speedup compared to the fastest exact algorithms, which run in O(n^2logn + (n - k)^3) time using O(n\logn + (n-k)^3) space by Eppstein et al., and O(nlogn + 4k_C_2k (3k)^k n) time by Atanassov et al. Existing heuristic peeling approaches are not area-based. Instead, an approach by Harsh et al. repeatedly removes the point furthest from the mean using various distance metrics and runs in O(nlogn + kn) time. Other approaches greedily peel one convex layer at a time, which is efficient when using an O(nlogn) time algorithm by Chazelle to compute the convex layers. However, in many cases this fails to recover outliers. For most values of n and k, our approach is the fastest and first practical choice for finding outliers based on minimizing the area of the convex hull. Our algorithm also generalizes to other objectives such as perimeter.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Assisted Dynamic Beampattern Optimization in Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is investigated. Initially, we introduce a design criterion wherein sensing data acquired from the preceding time slot is employed for instantaneous optimal beamforming in the succeeding time slot, aiming to enhance the communication rate. Subsequently, the development of optimal beamforming is addressed, and a high-caliber suboptimal resolution is derived utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques combined with the iterative rank minimization (IRM) methodology. Our evaluations, grounded on numerical analyses, reveal that the communication rate of the introduced beamforming strategy surpasses that of conventional omnidirectional sensing and pilot based approaches.</description>

      <title>A survey of Zarankiewicz problem in geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central topics in extremal graph theory is the study of the function $ex(n,H)$, which represents the maximum number of edges a graph with $n$ vertices can have while avoiding a fixed graph $H$ as a subgraph. Tur{\'a}n provided a complete characterization for the case when $H$ is a complete graph on $r$ vertices. Erd{\H o}s, Stone, and Simonovits extended Tur{\'a}n's result to arbitrary graphs $H$ with $\chi(H) &gt; 2$ (chromatic number greater than 2). However, determining the asymptotics of $ex(n, H)$ for bipartite graphs $H$ remains a widely open problem. A classical example of this is Zarankiewicz's problem, which asks for the asymptotics of $ex(n, K_{t,t})$. In this paper, we survey Zarankiewicz's problem, with a focus on graphs that arise from geometry. Incidence geometry, in particular, can be viewed as a manifestation of Zarankiewicz's problem in geometrically defined graphs.</description>

      <title>DeepJEB: 3D Deep Learning-based Synthetic Jet Engine Bracket Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have impacted various fields, including mechanical engineering. However, the development of diverse, high-quality datasets for structural analysis remains a challenge. Traditional datasets, like the jet engine bracket dataset, are limited by small sample sizes, hindering the creation of robust surrogate models. This study introduces the DeepJEB dataset, generated through deep generative models and automated simulation pipelines, to address these limitations. DeepJEB offers comprehensive 3D geometries and corresponding structural analysis data. Key experiments validated its effectiveness, showing significant improvements in surrogate model performance. Models trained on DeepJEB achieved up to a 23% increase in the coefficient of determination and over a 70% reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to those trained on traditional datasets. These results underscore the superior generalization capabilities of DeepJEB. By supporting advanced modeling techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), DeepJEB enables more accurate predictions in structural performance. The DeepJEB dataset is publicly accessible at: https://www.narnia.ai/dataset.</description>
