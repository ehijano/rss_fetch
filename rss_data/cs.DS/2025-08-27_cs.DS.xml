      <title>Integral Online Algorithms for Set Cover and Load Balancing with Convex Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Set Cover and Load Balancing are central problems in online optimization, and there is a long line of work on developing algorithms for these problems with convex objectives. Although we know optimal online algorithms with $\ell_p$-norm objectives, recent developments for general norms and convex objectives that rely on the online primal-dual framework apply only to fractional settings due to large integrality gaps.
  Our work focuses on directly designing integral online algorithms for Set Cover and Load Balancing with convex objectives, bypassing the convex-relaxation and the primal-dual technique. Some of the main implications are:
  1. For Online Set Cover, we can extend the results of Azar et. al. (2016) for convex objectives and of Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024) for symmetric norms from fractional to integral settings.
  2. Our results for convex objectives and symmetric norms even apply to the online generalized scheduling problem, which generalizes both Set Cover and Load Balancing. Previous works could only handle the offline version of this problem with norm objectives (Deng, Li, and Rabani 2023).
  3. Our methods easily extend to settings with disjoint-composition of norms. This allows us to recover or improve the norm-composition results of Nagarajan and Shen (2020), and Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024), and to extend our results to a large class of norms beyond symmetric.
  Our approach is to first reduce these problems to online packing problems, and then to design good approximation algorithms for the latter. To solve these packing problems, we use two key ideas. First, we decouple the global packing problem into a series of local packing problems on different machines. Next, we choose random activation thresholds for machines such that conditional on a machine being activated, the expected number of jobs it covers is high compared to its cost.</description>

      <title>Improving Pinwheel Density Bounds for Small Minimums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density bound for schedulability for general pinwheel instances is $\frac{5}{6}$, but density bounds better than $\frac{5}{6}$ can be shown for cases in which the minimum element $m$ of the instance is large. Several recent works have studied the question of the 'density gap' as a function of $m$, with best known lower and upper bounds of $O \left( \frac{1}{m} \right)$ and $O \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \right)$. We prove a density bound of $0.84$ for $m = 4$, the first $m$ for which a bound strictly better than $\frac{5}{6} = 0.8\overline{3}$ can be proven. In doing so, we develop new techniques, particularly a fast heuristic-based pinwheel solver and an unfolding operation.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Splitting-Off via Element-Connectivity Preserving Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B\'erczi, Chandrasekaran, Kir\'aly, and Kulkarni (ICALP 2024) recently described a splitting-off procedure in hypergraphs that preserves local-connectivity and outlined some applications. In this note we give an alternative proof via element-connectivity preserving reduction operations in graphs.</description>

      <title>Graph Traversal via Connected Mobile Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the Hamiltonian walk problem in the multi-agent coordination framework, referred to as $k$-agents Hamiltonian walk problem ($k$-HWP). In this problem, a set of $k$ connected agents collectively compute a spanning walk of a given undirected graph in the minimum steps. At each step, the agents are at $k$ distinct vertices and the induced subgraph made by the occupied vertices remains connected. In the next consecutive steps, each agent may remain stationary or move to one of its neighbours.To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been previously explored in the context of multi-agent systems with connectivity. As a generalization of the well-known Hamiltonian walk problem (when $k=1$), $k$-HWP is NP-hard. We propose a $(3-\frac{1}{21})$-approximation algorithm for 2-HWP on arbitrary graphs. For the tree, we define a restricted version of the problem and present an optimal algorithm for arbitrary values of $k$. Finally, we formalize the problem for $k$-uniform hypergraphs and present a $2(1+\ln k)$-approximation algorithm. This result is also adapted to design an approximation algorithm for $k$-HWP on general graphs when $k = O(1)$.</description>

      <title>Max-Min and 1-Bounded Space Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \&amp; Fractals 2016] proposed an approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of $MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin packing problem.</description>

      <title>DTC: Real-Time and Accurate Distributed Triangle Counting in Fully Dynamic Graph Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangle counting is a fundamental problem in graph mining, essential for analyzing graph streams with arbitrary edge orders. However, exact counting becomes impractical due to the massive size of real-world graph streams. To address this, approximate algorithms have been developed, but existing distributed streaming algorithms lack adaptability and struggle with edge deletions. In this article, we propose DTC, a novel family of single-pass distributed streaming algorithms for global and local triangle counting in fully dynamic graph streams. Our DTC-AR algorithm accurately estimates triangle counts without prior knowledge of graph size, leveraging multi-machine resources. Additionally, we introduce DTC-FD, an algorithm tailored for fully dynamic graph streams, incorporating edge insertions and deletions. Using Random Pairing and future edge insertion compensation, DTC-FD achieves unbiased and accurate approximations across multiple machines. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines. DTC-AR achieves up to $2029.4\times$ and $27.1\times$ more accuracy, while maintaining the best trade-off between accuracy and storage space. DTC-FD reduces estimation errors by up to $32.5\times$ and $19.3\times$, scaling linearly with graph stream size. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in tackling triangle counting in real-world scenarios.

      <title>No-Regret M${}^{\natural}$-Concave Function Maximization: Stochastic Bandit Algorithms and Hardness of Adversarial Full-Information Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions, a.k.a. gross substitute valuation functions, play a fundamental role in many fields, including discrete mathematics and economics. In practice, perfect knowledge of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions is often unavailable a priori, and we can optimize them only interactively based on some feedback. Motivated by such situations, we study online M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization problems, which are interactive versions of the problem studied by Murota and Shioura (1999). For the stochastic bandit setting, we present $O(T^{-1/2})$-simple regret and $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithms under $T$ times access to unbiased noisy value oracles of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions. A key to proving these results is the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization, which is one of our main technical results. While we obtain those positive results for the stochastic setting, another main result of our work is an impossibility in the adversarial setting. We prove that, even with full-information feedback, no algorithms that run in polynomial time per round can achieve $O(T^{1-c})$ regret for any constant $c &gt; 0$. Our proof is based on a reduction from the matroid intersection problem for three matroids, which would be a novel approach to establishing the hardness in online learning.</description>
