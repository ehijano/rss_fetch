      <title>Speed-accuracy tradeoff and its effect in the game of cricket: predictive modeling from statistical mechanics perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speed-accuracy tradeoffs are prevalent in a wide range of physical systems. In this paper, we demonstrate speed-accuracy tradeoffs in the game of cricket, where 'batters' score runs on the balls bowled by the 'bowlers'. It is shown that the run scoring rate by a batter and the probability of dismissal follow a power-law relation. Due to availability of extensive data, game of cricket is an excellent model for the study of the effect of speed-accuracy tradeoff on the overall performance of the system. It is shown that the exponent of the power-law governs the nature of the adaptability of the player in different conditions and can be used for their assessment. Further, it is demonstrated that the players with extreme values of the power-law exponent are better suited for different playing conditions as compared to the ones with moderate values. These findings can be utilized to identify the potential of the cricket players for different game formats and can further help team management in devising strategies for the best outcomes with a given set of players.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermion induced power-law scaling in the violation of Wiedemann-Franz law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>
