      <title>Spectral and Nilpotent Matrix Orderings: Comparison and Applications in Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our earlier work, we proposed the \emph{Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering} (SNO) as a new framework that extends matrix comparison beyond the Hermitian setting by incorporating both spectral and nilpotent structures. Building on that foundation, the present paper develops concrete certificates and applications of SNO. First, we employ generalized Gershgorin theorems to design certificates for spectral ordering that avoid direct eigenvalue computation and analyze their robustness under perturbations. Second, we introduce rank-based criteria that provide certificates for ordering the nilpotent parts of matrices without requiring a full Jordan decomposition. Finally, we apply the SNO framework to linear dynamical systems, where we construct a hierarchy of stability orderings that capture both asymptotic and transient behaviors. These contributions advance the theoretical underpinnings of SNO and demonstrate its potential as a versatile tool for operator analysis, computational methods, and stability studies in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of locally string algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that automorphisms of finite-dimensional bound quiver algebras decompose into inner automorphisms and automorphisms which permute the vertices. In this paper, we show that for string algebras, automorphisms permuting vertices further decompose into a graded automorphism and a composition of certain types of exponential automorphisms. Moreover, the same decomposition applies to automorphisms of locally string algebras, which are an analogue of string algebras wherein the finite-dimensional condition is omitted.</description>

      <title>A further study on averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras and special apre-perm bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to generalize the fact that an averaging commutative algebra gives rise to a perm algebra to the bialgebra level, the notion of a special apre-perm algebra was introduced as a new splitting of perm algebras, and it has been shown that an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm bialgebra. In this paper, we give a further study on averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras and special apre-perm bialgebras. A solution of the averaging associative Yang-Baxter equation whose symmetric part is invariant gives rise to an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra that is called quasi-triangular, and such solutions can be equivalently characterized as $\mathcal{O}$-operators of admissible averaging commutative algebras with weights. Moreover assuming the symmetric parts of such solutions to be zero or nondegenerate, we obtain typical subclasses of quasi-triangular averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras, namely the triangular and factorizable ones respectively. Both of them are shown to closely relate to symmetric averaging Rota-Baxter Frobenius commutative algebras. There is a parallel procedure developed for special apre-perm bialgebras. In particular, the fact that an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm bialgebra is still available when these bialgebras are limited to the quasi-triangular cases.</description>

      <title>A Note on Idempotent Matrices: The Poset Structure and The Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Idempotent elements play a fundamental role in ring theory, as they encode significant information about the underlying algebraic structure. In this paper, we study idempotent matrices from two perspectives. First, we analyze the partially ordered set of idempotents in matrix rings over a division ring. We characterize the partial order relation explicitly in terms of block decompositions of idempotent matrices. Second, over principal ideal domains, we establish an equivalent condition for a matrix to be idempotent, derived from matrix factorizations using the Smith normal form. We also consider extensions over unique factorization domains and constructions via the Kronecker product and the anti-transpose. Together, these results clarify both the structural and constructive aspects of idempotents in matrix rings. Moreover, the set of idempotent matrices over a field can be viewed as an affine algebraic variety.</description>

      <title>Geometry over finite local rings: Rigidity and Isospectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the simplicial order complexes obtained from free modules over finite local rings. These complexes arise naturally as geodesic spheres in Bruhat-Tits buildings over non-archimedean local fields. We establish two forms of rigidity, showing that their automorphism groups arise from the underlying algebraic group, and that they are determined by sparse induced subgraphs. We compute the spectra of these subgraphs and show that they form excellent expanders, which results in expansion for geodesic powers of Bruhat-Tits buildings. The computation also reveals that local rings with the same residue order give rise to isospectral induced subgraphs. Combining this with our rigidity results we show that the graphs arising from $n$-spaces over $\mathbb{Z}/p^{r}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]/(t^{r})$ are isospectral and non-isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Structure algebras of finite set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic algebras related to some classes of finite left non-degenerate solutions (X,r) of the Yang--Baxter equation have been intensively studied since they are the associative ring-theoretical tool to study solutions. These are the monoid algebras K[M(X,r)] and K[A(X,r)], over a field K, of its structure monoid M(X,r) and left derived structure monoid A(X,r). In case r is bijective (and thus also right non-degenerate) it is known that these algebras are representable (hence PI), left and right Noetherian and have finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. Moreover, such algebras are domains (or equivalently prime) if and only if they have finite global dimension, which also is equivalent to r being an involutive map. In this paper we deal with structure algebras of arbitrary finite left non-degenerate solutions (X,r), except for the last section. If (X,r) satisfies additional conditions, such as being bijective, idempotent or left derived, it has been shown in a series of papers that K[M(X,r)] is left Noetherian. In the first part of the paper we show that the algebra K[M(X,r)] always is left Noetherian. Via divisibility by generators, we construct an ideal chain in M(X,r) that has very strong algebraic structural properties on its Rees factors. This allows to obtain characterizations of when the algebras K[M(X,r)] and K[A(X,r)] are right Noetherian. Intricate relationships between ring-theoretical and homological properties of these algebras and properties of the solution (X,r) are proven. Furthermore, we describe the cancellative congruences of A(X,r) and M(X,r) as well as the prime spectrum of K[A(X,r)]. This then leads to an explicit formula for the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of K[M(X,r)] and it equals the classical Krull dimension.</description>

      <title>$\hbar$-Vertex algebras and chiralization of star products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of $\hbar$-vertex algebras, algebraic structures closely related to vertex algebras but with a deformed translation covariance axiom. We establish their structure theory, including analogues of Goddard's Uniqueness Theorem, the Reconstruction Theorem, Borcherds Identity, and the OPE Expansion Formula, and introduce the associated notions of $\hbar$-Lie conformal and $\hbar$-Poisson vertex algebras. The formalism provides a natural and simplified construction of the Zhu algebra. The main application is to the chiralization of classical star-products: we show that every star-product on the symmetric algebra of a Lie algebra (or its central extensions) admits a chiralization, and we derive explicit formulae for these chiral star-products, including the Moyal-Weyl and Gutt star-products. Setting $\hbar=0$ recovers explicit deformation quantizations of a broad class of Poisson vertex algebras, including the classical limits of free-boson, $\beta \gamma$-system, affine, and Virasoro vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>Bilinear maps having Jordan product property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric continuous bilinear maps $V$ on a C$^*$-algebra $A$ that have the Jordan product property at a fixed element $z\in A$. We show that, whenever $A$ is a finite direct sum or a $c_0$-sum of infinite simple von Neumann algebras, such a map $V$ has the square-zero property. Then, it is proved that $V(a,b)=T(a\circ b)$ for some bounded linear map $T$ on $A$. As a consequence, Jordan homomorphisms and derivations at $z\in A$ are characterized.</description>

      <title>Using nonassociative algebras to classify skew polycyclic codes up to isometry and equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing isomorphisms between their ambient algebras, we propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry for skew polycyclic codes that will lead to tighter classifications than existing ones. This reduces the number of previously known isometry and equivalence classes. In the process, we classify classes of skew $(f,\sigma,\delta)$-polycyclic codes with the same performance parameters, to avoid duplicating already existing codes, and state precisely when different notions of equivalence coincide.
  The generator of a skew polycyclic code is in one-one correspondence with the generator of a principal left ideal in its ambient algebra. We allow the ambient algebras to be nonassociative, thus eliminating the need on restrictions on the length of the codes. Algebra isomorphisms that preserve the Hamming distance (called isometries) map generators of principal left ideals to generators of principal left ideals and preserve length, dimension and Hamming distance of the codes. The isometries between the ambient algebras can also be used to classify corresponding linear codes equipped with the rank metric.</description>

      <title>The Negation Of Singer's Conjecture For The Sixth Algebraic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09455v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$</description>
