      <title>Oscillations and differences in Besov-Morrey and Besov-type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Besov-Morrey spaces $\mathcal{N}^{s}_{u,p,q}(\Omega)$ and Besov-type spaces $B^{s,\tau}_{p,q}(\Omega)$ of positive smoothness defined on Lipschitz domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ as well as on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We combine the Hedberg-Netrusov approach to function spaces with distinguished kernel representations due to Triebel, in order to derive novel characterizations of these scales in terms of local oscillations provided that some standard conditions concerning the parameters are fulfilled. In connection with that we also obtain new characterizations of $\mathcal{N}^{s}_{u,p,q}(\Omega)$ and $B^{s,\tau}_{p,q}(\Omega)$ via differences of higher order. By the way we recover and extend corresponding results for the scale of classical Besov spaces $B^{s}_{p,q}(\Omega)$.

      <title>Operators in the Fock-Toeplitz algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider various classes of bounded operators on the Fock space $F^2$ of Gaussian square integrable entire functions over the complex plane. These include Toeplitz (type) operators, weighted composition operators, singular integral operators, Volterra-type operators and Hausdorff operators and range from classical objects in harmonic analysis to more recently introduced classes. As a leading problem and closely linked to well-known compactness characterizations we pursue the question of when these operators are contained in the Toeplitz algebra. This paper combines a (certainly in-complete) survey of the classical and more recent literature including new ideas for proofs from the perspective of quantum harmonic analysis (QHA). Moreover, we have added a number of new theorems and links between known results.</description>

      <title>The Muckenhoupt condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to unify the theory of weights beyond the setting of weighted Lebesgue spaces in the general setting of quasi-Banach function spaces. We prove new characterizations for the boundedness of singular integrals, and pose several conjectures and partial results related to the duality of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. Furthermore, we give an overview of the theory applied to weighted variable Lebesgue and Morrey spaces.</description>

      <title>Twenty-five years of greedy bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the basic idea behind the concept of a greedy basis had been around for some time, the formal development of a theory of greedy bases was initiated in 1999 with the publication of the article [S.~V.~Konyagin and V.~N.~Temlyakov, A remark on greedy approximation in Banach spaces, East J. Approx. 5 (1999), no. 3, 365--379]. The theoretical simplicity of the thresholding greedy algorithm became a model for a procedure widely used in numerical applications and the subject of greedy bases evolved very rapidly from the point of view of approximation theory. The idea of studying greedy bases and related greedy algorithms attracted also the attention of researchers with a classical Banach space theory background. From the more abstract point of functional analysis, the theory of greedy bases and its derivates evolved very fast as many fundamental results were discovered and new ramifications branched out. Hundreds of papers on greedy-like bases and several monographs have been written since the foundational paper mentioned above appeared. After twenty-five years, the theory is very much alive and it continues to be a very active research topic both for functional analysts and for researchers interested in the applied nature of nonlinear approximation alike. This is why we believe it is a good moment to gather a selection of 25 open problems (one per year since 1999!) whose solution would contribute to advance the state of art of this beautiful topic.</description>

      <title>Construction of strong derivable maps via functional calculus of unbounded spectral operators in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a strong derivable map and calculate its derivative by employing a result in our previous work on strong derivability of maps arising by functional calculus of an unbounded scalar type spectral operator $R$ in a Banach space and the generalization to complete locally convex spaces of a classical result valid in the Banach space context. We apply this result to obtain a sequence of integrals converging to an integral of a complete locally convex space extension of a map arising by functional calculus of $R$.</description>
