      <title>Framework for asset-liability management with fixed-term securities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an optimal investment-consumption problem for a utility-maximizing investor who has access to assets with different liquidity and whose consumption rate as well as terminal wealth are subject to lower-bound constraints. Assuming utility functions that satisfy standard conditions, we develop a methodology for deriving the optimal strategies in semi-closed form. Our methodology is based on the generalized martingale approach and the decomposition of the problem into subproblems. We illustrate our approach by deriving explicit formulas for agents with power-utility functions and discuss potential extensions of the proposed framework. In numerical studies, we substantiate how the parameters of our framework impact the optimal proportion of initial capital allocated to the illiquid asset, the monetary value that the investor subjectively assigns to the fixed-term asset, and the potential of the illiquid asset to increase terminal the terminal value of liabilities without loss in the investor's expected utility.</description>

      <title>Beating the Correlation Breakdown: Robust Inference, Flexible Scenarios, and Stress Testing for Financial Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We live in a multivariate world, and effective modeling of financial portfolios, including their construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis, simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than the combined effects of other parameters in investment and risk models, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures in useable and useful ways under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid inferences about their estimates, and to use these inferences for essential purposes such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular scenario and reverse scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals. This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distributions of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls, Spearmans, Tail Dependence Matrix, and others). The solution remains valid under marginal asset distributions characterized by notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. Importantly, NAbCs p-values and confidence intervals remain analytically consistent at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level. Finally, NAbC maintains validity even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen for a given scenario or stress test, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios. NAbC stands alone in providing all of these capabilities simultaneously, and should prove to be a very useful means by which we can better understand and manage financial portfolios in our multivariate world.</description>
