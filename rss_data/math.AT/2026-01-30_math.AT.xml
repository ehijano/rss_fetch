      <title>On sequential versions of various parametrized invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study sequential versions of several fibrewise homotopy invariants, including parametrized topological complexity, parametrized (subspace) homotopic distance. We investigate their basic properties, establish relationships among them, and compare them with the corresponding classical homotopical invariants.</description>

      <title>Canonical chain complexes for Morse-Smale vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960, Smale defined a filtration of a closed smooth manifold by the unstable manifolds of fixed points and closed orbits of a Morse-Smale vector field defined on it, and derived generalized Morse inequalities. This suggests that, similarly to the Morse chain complex of a gradient-like vector field, even in the presence of closed orbits, Morse-Smale vector fields admit canonical chain complexes, invariant under topological equivalence, from which one can algebraically derive Morse inequalities. In this paper we show that this is actually the case, improving the state of the art that only offers non-canonical chain complexes. Technically, we achieve this result considering the \v{C}ech homology spectral sequence of the unstable manifolds filtration. In particular, we turn bounded exact couples into chain complexes such that the limit page of the spectral sequence associated with an exact couple gives the homology of the chain complex. We showcase our construction with examples.</description>

      <title>A Sheaf-Theoretic and Topological Perspective on Complex Network Modeling and Attention Mechanisms in Graph Neural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.</description>

      <title>Synchronization points: growth, asymptotics, congruences, and the synchronization zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the synchronization zeta function associated with a pair of self-maps of a topological space and investigate its properties. We also define the growth rate of synchronization points and derive an explicit formula in the setting of endomorphisms of compact, connected Abelian groups. In addition, we establish Gauss congruences and describe the asymptotic behavior for the sequence of numbers of synchronization points, under the assumption that the synchronization zeta function is rational. Further, we discuss connections with topological entropy and Reidemeister torsion.</description>

      <title>Retrieving biparameter persistence modules from monoparameter ones: a characterization of hook-decomposable persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to relate the biparameter persistence module induced by a pair of scalar functions with the monoparameter persistence modules induced by each function separately, we introduce a construction that defines a kind of product between two monoparameter persistence modules. While originally conceived to serve this comparative purpose, our construction unexpectedly reveals a deeper structural property: it also characterizes a class of biparameter modules known as hook-decomposable modules.</description>

      <title>On the additive image of 0th persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $X$ a finite category and $F$ a finite field, we study the additive image of the functor $\operatorname{H}_0(-,F) \colon \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Top}) \to \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$, or equivalently, of the free functor $\operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Set}) \to \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$.
  We characterize all finite categories $X$ for which the indecomposables in the additive image coincide with the indecomposable indicator representations and provide examples of quivers of wild representation type where the additive image contains only finitely many indecomposables. Motivated by questions in topological data analysis, we conduct a detailed analysis of the additive image for finite grids. In particular, we show that for grids of infinite representation type, there exist infinitely many indecomposables both within and outside the additive image.
  We develop an algorithm for determining if a representation of a finite category is in the additive image. In addition, we investigate conditions for realizability and the effect of modifications of the source category and the underlying field.
  The paper concludes with a discussion of the additive image of $\operatorname{H}_n(-,F)$ for an arbitrary field $F$, extending previous work for prime fields.</description>
