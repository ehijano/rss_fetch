      <title>Shock-cooling Constraints via Early-time Observations of the Type IIb SN 2022hnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of a rapid follow-up campaign on the Type IIb Supernova (SN) 2022hnt. We present a daily, multi-band, photometric follow-up using the Las Cumbres Observatory, the Zwicky Transient Facility, the orbiting \textit{Swift} observatory, and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). A distinctive feature in the light curve of SN 2022hnt and other IIb SNe is an early narrow peak prior to the ${}^{56}$Ni peak caused by rapid shock cooling of the hydrogen envelope, which can serve as an important probe of the properties of the massive progenitor star in the moments before explosion. Using SN 2022hnt as a case study, we demonstrate a framework of considerations for the application of shock cooling models to type IIb SNe, outlining a consistent procedure for future surveys of Type IIb SNe progenitor and explosion properties. \hll{We fit several recent models of shock-cooling emission and obtain progenitor radii between $\sim50$ and $\sim100$ $R_\odot$, as well as hydrogen-enriched envelope masses between $\sim0.01$ and $\sim0.1$ $M_\odot$, both consistent with values for other IIb SNe. One of these models is the model of \cite{Morag2023}, marking the first time this model has been applied to a Type IIb SN.} We evaluate contrasting predictions between shock-cooling models to construct a fiducial parameter set which can be used for comparison to other SNe. Finally, we investigate the possibility of extended wind breakout or precursor emission captured in the earliest detections.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing parametric gravitational-wave population fits from non-parametric results without refitting the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining multiple events into population analyses is a cornerstone of gravitational-wave astronomy. A critical component of such studies is the assumed population model, which can range from astrophysically motivated functional forms to non-parametric treatments that are flexible but difficult to interpret. In practice, the current approach is to fit the data multiple times with different population models to identify robust features. We propose an alternative strategy: assuming the data have already been fit with a flexible model, we present a practical recipe to reconstruct the population distribution of a different model. As our procedure postprocesses existing results, it avoids the need to access the underlying gravitational-wave data again and handle selection effects. Additionally, our reconstruction metric provides a goodness-of-fit measure to compare multiple models. We apply this method to the mass distribution of black-hole binaries detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Our work paves the way for streamlined gravitational-wave population analyses by fitting the data once and for all with advanced non-parametric methods and careful handling of selection effects, while the astrophysical interpretation is then made accessible using our reconstruction procedure on targeted models. The key principle is that of conceptually separating data description from data interpretation.</description>

      <title>r-Process Nucleosynthesis and Radioactively Powered Transients from Magnetar Giant Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present nucleosynthesis and light-curve predictions for a new site of the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) from magnetar giant flares (GFs). Motivated by observations indicating baryon ejecta from GFs, Cehula et al. (2024) proposed mass ejection occurs after a shock is driven into the magnetar crust during the GF. We confirm using nuclear reaction network calculations that these ejecta synthesize moderate yields of third-peak $r$-process nuclei and more substantial yields of lighter $r$-nuclei, while leaving a sizable abundance of free neutrons in the outermost fastest expanding ejecta layers. The final $r$-process mass fraction and distribution are sensitive to the relative efficiencies of $\alpha$-capture and $n$-capture freeze-outs. We use our nucleosynthesis output in a semi-analytic model to predict the light curves of novae breves, the transients following GFs powered by radioactive decay. For a baryonic ejecta mass similar to that inferred of the 2004 Galactic GF from SGR 1806-20, we predict a peak UV/optical luminosity of $\sim 10^{39}$-$10^{40}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at $\sim 10$-$15$ minutes, rendering such events potentially detectable following a gamma-ray trigger by wide-field transient monitors such as ULTRASAT/UVEX to several Mpc. The peak luminosity and timescale of the transient increase with the GF strength due to the larger ejecta mass. Although GFs likely contribute 1-10% of the total Galactic $r$-process budget, their short delay-times relative to star-formation make them an attractive source to enrich the earliest generations of stars.</description>

      <title>The collisionless hydrodynamics: On the nonexistence of collisionless shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks, essential for astrophysics, perhaps do not exist as statistically stationary solutions. If so, any quantitative statement about a collisionless shock should be qualified by the age of the shock.
  A theoretical description of the upstream of the 1+1 dimensional electrostatic collisionless shock is developed -- collisionless hydrodynamics. Peculiarities of collisionless hydrodynamics prevent a shock formation when a piston is driven into cold plasma. An exact self-similar solution is found instead; the spatial extent of the solution grows linearly in time.
  Direct numerical simulations of plasma kinetics in 1+1 dimensions confirm the hydrodynamic result -- a statistically steady collisionless shock doesn't exist. Instead, at each fixed time, there is a continuous succession in space of marginally stable velocity distribution functions. The spatial support of this continuous succession grows linearly in time.</description>

      <title>Observing Rayleigh-Taylor stable and unstable accretion through a Kalman filter analysis of X-ray pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global, three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of rotating, magnetized, compact stellar objects reveal that accretion occurs in three regimes: the stable regime, the chaotic unstable regime, and the ordered unstable regime. Here we track stochastic fluctuations in the pulse period $P(t)$ and aperiodic X-ray luminosity $L(t)$ time series of 24 accretion-powered pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud using an unscented Kalman filter to analyze Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data. We measure time-resolved histories of the magnetocentrifugal fastness parameter $\omega(t)$ and we connect $\omega(t)$ with the three Rayleigh-Taylor accretion regimes. The 24 objects separate into two distinct groups, with 10 accreting in the stable regime, and 14 accreting in the ordered unstable regime. None of the 24 objects except SXP 293 visit the chaotic unstable regime for sustained intervals, although several objects visit it sporadically. The Kalman filter output also reveals a positive temporal cross-correlation between $\omega(t)$ and the independently measured pulse amplitude $A(t)$, which agrees with simulation predictions regarding the pulse-forming behavior of magnetospheric funnel flows in the three accretion regimes.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Emission by Magnetically Arrested Disks and Relativistic Jets of Black Hole X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) are observed in various wavelengths from radio to GeV gamma-ray. Several BHXBs, including MAXI J1820+070 and Cygnus X-1, are also found to emit ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $&gt;$100 TeV) gamma rays. The origin and production mechanism of the multi-wavelength emission of BHXBs are under debate. We propose a scenario where relativistic particles from magnetically arrested disks (MADs), which could form when BHXBs are in quiescent or hard states, produce UHE gamma rays, while electrons in the jets produce GeV gamma-ray emission. Specifically, magnetic turbulence in MADs heats up and accelerates electrons and protons, while magnetic reconnection in jets accelerates electrons. Sub-PeV gamma rays and neutrinos are produced when relativistic protons interact with the thermal protons and the radiation by thermal electrons in the disk. We discuss the perspectives of observing sub-PeV multi-messenger signals from individual BHXBs. Finally, we evaluate the integrated fluxes of the quiescent and hard-state BHXB population and find that BHXBs may contribute to the Galactic diffuse emission above $\sim 100$ TeV.</description>

      <title>GECKO Follow-up Observation of the Binary Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger Candidate S230518h</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) event S230518h is a potential binary neutron star-black hole merger (NSBH) event that was detected during engineering run 15 (ER15), which served as the commissioning period before the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O4a observing run. Despite its low probability of producing detectable electromagnetic emissions, we performed extensive follow-up observations of this event using the GECKO telescopes in the southern hemisphere. Our observation covered 61.7\% of the 90\% credible region, a $\rm 284\:deg^2$ area accessible from the southern hemisphere, reaching a median limiting magnitude of $R=21.6$ mag. In these images, we conducted a systematic search for an optical counterpart of this event by combining a CNN-based classifier and human verification. We identified 128 transient candidates, but no significant optical counterpart was found that could have caused the GW signal. Furthermore, we provide feasible KN properties that are consistent with the upper limits of observation. Although no optical counterpart was found, our result demonstrates both GECKO's efficient wide-field follow-up capabilities and usefulness for constraining properties of kilonovae from NSBH mergers at distances of $\sim 200$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for the Analysis of Traced Particles in Kinetic Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas are often investigated with fully-kinetic or hybrid kinetic numerical simulations, which enable us to describe a detailed microphysics of particle energization mechanisms. Tracing of individual particles in such simulations is especially useful in this regard. However, visually inspecting particle trajectories introduces a significant amount of bias and uncertainty, making it challenging to pinpoint specific acceleration mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach utilising neural networks to assist in the analysis of individual particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the dataset from our recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of non-relativistic perpendicular shocks that consists of 252,000 electrons, each characterised by their position, momentum and electromagnetic field at particle's position, recorded in a time series of 1200 time steps. These electrons cross a region affected by the electrostatic Buneman instability, and a small percentage of them attain high energies. We perform classification, regression, and anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset by using a convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron, and an autoencoder. Despite the noisy and imbalanced dataset, all methods demonstrate the capability to differentiate between thermal and accelerated electrons with remarkable accuracy. The proposed methodology may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and hybrid simulations.</description>

      <title>Can circumstellar interaction explain the strange light curve features of Type Ib/c supernovae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The evolution and the surrounding of stripped-envelope supernova progenitors are still under debate: some studies suggest single-star, while others prefer massive binary progenitors. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the exploding star and its interaction with circumstellar matter could significantly modify the overall light curve features of these objects. To better understand the effect of stellar evolution and circumstellar interaction, systematic hydrodynamic calculations are needed.
  Aims. Here, we test the hypothesis that circumstellar matter generated by an extreme episodic $\eta$ Carinae-like eruption that occurs days or weeks before the supernova explosion may explain the controversies related to the general light curve features of stripped-envelope supernovae.
  Methods. In this work, we present our bolometric light curve calculations of both single- and binary progenitors generated by hydrodynamic simulations via MESA and SNEC. We also studied the effect of an interaction with a close, low-mass circumstellar matter assumed to be created just a few days or weeks before the explosion. Beyond generating a model light curve grid, we compared our results with some observational data.
  Results. We found that merely the shape of the supernova light curve could indicate that the cataclysmic death of the massive star happened in a binary system or was related to the explosion of a single star. Moreover, our study also shows that a confined dense circumstellar matter may be responsible for the strange light curve features (bumps, re-brightening, or steeper tail) of some Type Ib/c supernovae.</description>

      <title>XRISM observations of the cooling flow cluster A2029 support heating by mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I argue that the mixing-heating mechanism of the intracluster medium (ICM) is compatible with the new observations by the X-ray telescope XRISM that show the dispersion velocity in the cooling flow cluster of galaxies A2029 to be 169 km/s. Past jets from the central supermassive black hole induced turbulence; the velocity dispersion value indicates that the jets were powerful, as expected in the mixing-heating mechanism. Although the kinetic energy of the ICM turbulence that XRISM finds is short of heating the ICM and counter radiative cooling, the turbulence is fast enough to mix the hot shocked jets' material with the ICM on time scales shorter than the radiative cooling time. The support of the mixing-heating mechanism from determining the turbulent velocity I claim for A2029 is similar to the conclusion from the X-ray observations by the X-ray telescope Hitomi of the Perseus cluster.</description>

      <title>BASS XLVII: 22 GHz Radio Atlas of Swift-BAT Selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected AGN, with a very high $98 \pm 1\%$ detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1" spatial resolution covering over $6$ orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGN that span $\sim4$ orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: $44 \pm 3\%$ (102/231) are compact or unresolved, $46 \pm 3\%$ (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and $8 \pm 2\%$ (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining $2 \pm 1\%$ (4/231) sources are non-detections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGN ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{14-195 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5.5}$ and $\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{2-10 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5}$) with a scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex are similar to that of coronally active stars ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_X \sim 10^{-5}$). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous FIR observations, once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGN at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation VLA (ngVLA) or Square Kilometre Array (SKA), both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGN.</description>

      <title>The highest energy cosmic rays from superheavy dark matter particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly accepted that high energy cosmic rays up to $10^{19}$ eV can be produced in catastrophic astrophysical processes. However the source of a few observed events with higher energies remains mysterious. We propose that they may originate from decay or annihilation of ultra heavy particles of dark matter. Such particles naturally appear in some models of modified gravity related to Starobinsky inflation.</description>

Abstract: This article briefly discusses the philosophical and technical aspects of AI. It focuses on two concepts of understanding: intuition and causality, and highlights three AI technologies: Transformers, chain-of-thought reasoning, and multimodal processing. We anticipate that in principle AI could form understanding, with these technologies representing promising advancements.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.</description>

      <title>A systematically-selected sample of luminous, long-duration, ambiguous nuclear transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a search for luminous, long-duration ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs) similar to the unprecedented discovery of the extreme, ambiguous event AT2021lwx with a $&gt;150$\,d rise time and luminosity $10^{45.7}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. We use the Lasair transient broker to search Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data for transients lasting more than one year and exhibiting smooth declines. Our search returns 59 events, seven of which we classify as ANTs assumed to be driven by accretion onto supermassive black holes. We propose the remaining 52 are stochastic variability from regular supermassive black hole accretion rather than distinct transients. We supplement the seven ANTs with three nuclear transients in ZTF that fail the light curve selection but have clear single flares and spectra that do not resemble typical AGN. All of these 11 ANTs have a mid-infrared flare from an assumed dust echo, implying the ubiquity of dust around the black holes giving rise to ANTs. No events are more luminous than AT2021lwx, but one (ZTF19aamrjar) has twice the duration and a higher integrated energy release. On the other extreme, ZTF20abodaps reaches a luminosity close to AT2021lwx with a rise time $&lt;20$\,d and that fades smoothly in $&gt;600$\,d. We define a portion of rise-time versus flare amplitude space that selects ANTs with $\sim50$ per cent purity against variable active galactic nuclei. We calculate a volumetric rate of $\gtrsim 3\times10^{-11}$\,Mpc$^{-1}$\,yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the events being caused by tidal disruptions of intermediate and high-mass stars.</description>

      <title>The Quark-Nova model for FRBs: model comparison with observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the Quark-Novae (QN) model for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs; Ouyed et al. 2021; arXiv:2005.09793) to evaluate its performance in reproducing the distribution and statistical properties of key observations. These include frequency, duration, fluence, dispersion measure (DM), and other relevant features such as repetition, periodic activity window, and the sad trombone effect. In our model, FRBs are attributed to coherent synchrotron emission (CSE) originating from collisionless QN chunks that traverse ionized media both within and outside their host galaxies. By considering burst repetition from a single chunk and accounting for the intrinsic DM of the chunks, we find agreement between our model and the observed properties of FRBs. This agreement enhances our confidence in the model's effectiveness for interpreting FRB observations. Our model generates testable predictions, allowing for future experiments and observations to validate and further refine our understanding of FRBs.</description>

      <title>On gamma rays as predictors of UHECR flux in AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the main candidates for ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) sources. However, while some theoretical and phenomenological works favor AGNs as the main sources, recent works have shown that using the very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray flux as a proxy for the UHECR flux leads to a bad agreement with data. In this context, the energy spectrum and composition data are hardly fitted. At the same time, the arrival directions map is badly described and a spurious dipole direction is produced. In this work, we propose a possible solution to these contradictions. Using the observed $\gamma$-ray flux as a proxy may carry the implicit assumption of beamed UHECR emission and, consequently, its beam will remain collimated up to its detection on Earth. We show that assuming an isotropic UHECR emission and correcting the $\gamma$-ray emission proxy by Doppler boosting can overcome the problem. The combined fit of the spectrum and composition is improved, with a change of reduced $\chi^2$ from 4.6 to 3.1. In particular, the tension between the observed and modeled dipole directions can be reduced from $5.9 \ (2.1)\sigma$ away from the data to $3.5 \ (1.1)\sigma$ for $E &gt; 8$ EeV ($E &gt; 32$ EeV). We also show that this effect is particularly important when including AGNs of different classes in the same analysis, such as radio galaxies and blazars.</description>

      <title>SN 2021foa: the bridge between SN IIn and Ibn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the long-term photometric and spectroscopic analysis of a transitioning SN~IIn/Ibn from $-$10.8 d to 150.7 d post $V$-band maximum. SN~2021foa shows prominent He {\sc i} lines comparable in strength to the H$\alpha$ line around peak, placing SN~2021foa between the SN~IIn and SN~Ibn populations. The spectral comparison shows that it resembles the SN~IIn population at pre-maximum, becomes intermediate between SNe~IIn/Ibn and at post-maximum matches with SN~IIn 1996al. The photometric evolution shows a precursor at $-$50 d and a light curve shoulder around 17d. The peak luminosity and color evolution of SN 2021foa are consistent with most SNe~IIn and Ibn in our comparison sample. SN~2021foa shows the unique case of a SN~IIn where the narrow P-Cygni in H$\alpha$ becomes prominent at 7.2 days. The H$\alpha$ profile consists of a narrow (500 -- 1200 km s$^{-1}$) component, intermediate width (3000 -- 8000 km s$^{-1}$) and broad component in absorption. Temporal evolution of the H$\alpha$ profile favours a disk-like CSM geometry. Hydrodynamical modelling of the lightcurve well reproduces a two-component CSM structure with different densities ($\rho$ $\propto$ r$^{-2}$ -- $\rho$ $\propto$ r$^{-5}$), mass-loss rates (10$^{-3}$ -- 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) assuming a wind velocity of 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and having a CSM mass of 0.18 M$_{\odot}$. The overall evolution indicates that SN~2021foa most likely originated from a LBV star transitioning to a WR star with the mass-loss rate increasing in the period from 5 to 0.5 years before the explosion or it could be due to a binary interaction.</description>

      <title>A diverse, overlooked population of Type Ia supernovae exhibiting mid-infrared signatures of delayed circumstellar interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae arise from the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in multiple star systems. A rare sub-class of SNe Ia exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), allowing for direct constraints on companion material. While most known events show evidence for dense nearby CSM identified via peak-light spectroscopy (as SNe Ia-CSM), targeted late-time searches have revealed a handful of cases exhibiting delayed CSM interaction with detached shells. Here, we present the first all-sky search for late CSM interaction in SNe Ia using a new image-subtraction pipeline for mid-infrared data from the NEOWISE space telescope. Analyzing a sample of $\approx 8500$ SNe Ia, we report evidence for late-time mid-infrared brightening in six previously overlooked events spanning sub-types SNe Iax, normal SNe Ia, SNe Ia-91T and super-Chandra SNe Ia. Our systematic search doubles the known sample, and suggests that $\gtrsim 0.1$% of SNe Ia exhibit mid-infrared signatures of delayed CSM interaction. The mid-infrared light curves ubiquitously indicate the presence of multiple (or extended) detached CSM shells located at $\gtrsim 10^{16}-10^{17}$ cm, containing $10^{-6}-10^{-4}$ $M_\odot$ of dust, with some sources showing evidence for new dust formation, likely within the cold, dense shell of the ejecta. We do not detect interaction signatures in spectroscopic and radio follow-up; however, the limits are largely consistent with previously confirmed events given the sensitivity and observation phase. Our results highlight that CSM interaction is more prevalent than previously estimated from optical and ultraviolet searches, and that mid-infrared synoptic surveys provide a unique window into this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Resolution requirements for numerical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino quantum kinetics is a rapidly evolving field in computational astrophysics, with a primary focus on collective neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and post-merger phases of binary neutron star mergers. In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning resolution dependence in numerical simulations. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive resolution study in both angular- and spatial directions by using two independent schemes of quantum kinetic neutrino transport: finite volume and pseudospectral methods. We complement our discussion by linear stability analysis including inhomogeneous modes. Our result suggests that decreasing spatial resolutions underestimates the growth of flavor instability, and then leads to wrong asymptotic states of flavor conversions, which potentially has a critical impact on astrophysical consequences. We further delve into numerical results of low resolution simulations, that reveals the underlying mechanism responsible for numerical artifacts caused by insufficient resolutions. This study settles the debate on requirements of resolutions and serves as a guideline for numerical modeling of quantum kinetic neutrino transport.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new phase-transient cyclotron line in A0535+26: Constraints on the accretion geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In November 2020, A0535+26 underwent one of its brightest outbursts, reaching nearly 12 Crab in X-ray flux. Observed by \textit{Insight-HXMT}, \textit{NuSTAR}, \textit{NICER}, and \textit{AstroSat}, this event provided valuable insights into Be/X-ray binaries. The pulse profiles evolved significantly with luminosity, transitioning from pencil-beam to fan-beam geometries. A0535+26, known for its fundamental cyclotron line at $\sim$44 keV, became only the second source to exhibit a negative correlation between cyclotron line energy and flux at high luminosities, with a plateau phase preceding the transition from positive to negative correlation. We report the discovery of a phase-transient low-energy cyclotron line, detected in a narrow phase range ($\sim$16\%) across all seven \textit{NuSTAR} observations during the rising, peak, and declining phases of the outburst. The new line exhibited dramatic variations with pulse phase and luminosity. We explain this behavior using an accretion geometry where the accretion column sweeps across the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection: an alternative explanation of radio emission in galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of galaxy clusters show radio emission extended over almost the system scale, necessitating mechanisms for particle acceleration. Previous models for acceleration such as diffusive shock acceleration and that due to turbulence can fall short in terms of efficiency. In this letter, we propose the possibility of acceleration via magnetic reconnection. In particular, we invoke the plasmoid instability which has been previously applied to understand particle energization in high energy systems. Turbulence in galaxy clusters lead to fluctuation dynamos that are known to generate magnetic fields structures consisting of sharp reversals. These form natural sites of reconnection. We perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the plasmoid instability in collisionless and nonrelativistic plasmas. We show that the resulting electron energy spectra have power law indices that are consistent with that inferred from observations. Our estimates show that the acceleration timescales are much smaller than the lifetime of the reconnecting magnetic structures indicating the feasibility of our model. The synchrotron radio luminosity estimate is about $10^{41}$ ergs/s, agreeing with observations. Finally, we find that the maximum achievable Lorentz factor can go upto $10^5$ indicating that acceleration due magnetic reconnection is a promising avenue for understanding the origin of nonthermal emission in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Can light-rings self-gravitate?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a spherically symmetric and static spacetime of a compact object, such as that of a Schwarzschild black hole, the light-ring is a 2-sphere where photons experience the only possible circular orbits. As a "Gedankenexperiment", we imagine an advanced civilisation able to populate the light-ring of a nonrotating black hole of mass $M$ with photons having a fine-tuned impact parameter that allows their orbits to be exactly circular with radius $r=3M$. As the number of photons in the light-ring increases in time, its mass will no longer be negligible and hence it will impact on the background spacetime, that is, it will "self-gravitate". We here consider two different routes to assign a nonzero mass to the light-ring that are either based on a discrete concentration of photons on a specific radial location or on a suitable distribution of photons in a given region. In both cases, and using the Einstein equations, we find that the inclusion of the energy from the accumulated photons leads to the generation of new light-rings. Such new light-rings can either appear at well-defined but discrete locations, or be fused in a well-defined region. In either case, we show that such light-ring configurations are dynamically unstable and a small perturbation, either via the inclusion of an additional photon onto the light-ring or via the absorption of a photon by the black hole, leads to a catastrophic destruction of the light-ring structures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>

Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of eccentric, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) immersed in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei. We find that single gravitational-wave observations from these systems could provide measurements with ~ 10 % relative precision of, simultaneously, the disk viscosity and mass accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole. This is possible when the EMRI transitions, within the observation time, from supersonic to subsonic motion relative to the disk gas, for eccentricities e &gt; ~ 0.025-0.1. The estimate of the accretion rate would assist in the identification of the EMRI's host galaxy, or the observation of a direct electromagnetic counterpart, improving the chances of using these sources as cosmological sirens. Our work highlights the rich phenomenology of binary evolution in astrophysical environments and the need to improve the modelling and analysis of these systems for future gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Jets are the most robust observable ingredient of common envelope evolution</title>

Abstract: I examine images of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) with observable post-common envelope evolution (CEE) binary central stars and find that jets are about 40 percent more common than dense equatorial outflows. Because, in some cases, energetic jets can compress an equatorial outflow and because fast jets might disperse early in the PN evolution and avoid detection, the CEE process is likelier to launch jets than to eject a dense equatorial outflow by a larger factor than 1.4. In most cases, the companion, mainly a main sequence star, launches the jets as it accretes mass from the envelope of the giant star. By CEE jets, I also refer to jets launched shortly before the onset of the CEE, likely a grazing envelope evolution phase, and shortly after the CEE. The jets and the accretion of mass by the companion before, during, and after the CEE affect envelope mass removal and the final orbital separation. Most numerical simulations of the CEE ignore jets, and those that include jets omit other processes. Despite the considerable progress in the last decade with tens of hydrodynamical simulations of the CEE, we are still far from correctly simulating the CEE. Including jets in simulations of the CEE requires heavy computer resources, but it must be the next step.</description>

      <title>Inferring additional physics through unmodelled signal reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave data is often computationally expensive, requiring simplifying assumptions such as circularisation of binary orbits. Although, if included, the sub-dominant effects like orbital eccentricity may provide crucial insights into the formation channels of compact binary mergers. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline strategy leveraging minimally modelled waveform reconstruction to identify the presence of eccentricity in real time. Using injected signals, we demonstrate that ignoring eccentricity ($e_{\rm 20Hz} \gtrsim 0.1$) leads to significant biases in parameter recovery, including chirp mass estimates falling outside the 90% credible interval. Waveform reconstruction shows inconsistencies increase with eccentricity, and this behaviour is consistent for different mass ratios. Our method enables low-latency inferences of binary properties supporting targeted follow-up analyses and can be applied to identify any physical effect of measurable strength.</description>
