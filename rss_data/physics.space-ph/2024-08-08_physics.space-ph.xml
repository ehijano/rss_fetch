      <title>Deriving the Topological Properties of the Magnetic Field of Coronal Mass Ejections from In Situ Measurements: Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are magnetized plasma systems with highly complex magnetic topology and evolution. Methods developed to assess their magnetic configuration have primarily focused on reconstructing three-dimensional representations from one-dimensional time series measurements taken in situ using techniques based on the "highly twisted magnetic flux rope" approximations. However, the magnetic fields of CMEs is know to have more complicated geometries. Their structure can be quantified using measures of field line topology, which have been primarily used for solar physics research. In this work, we introduce a novel technique of directly quantifying the various form of magnetic helicity within a CME in the interplanetary space using synthetic in situ measurements. We use a relatively simple three-dimensional simulation of a CME initiated with a highly-twisted flux rope. We find that a significant portion of the magnetic helicity near 1~au is contained in writhe and mutual helicity rather than just in twist. We discuss the implications of this finding for fitting and reconstruction techniques.</description>

      <title>Case studies on pre-eruptive X-class flares using R-value in the lower solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The R-value is a measure of the strength of photospheric magnetic Polarity Inversion Lines (PILs) in Active Regions (ARs). This work investigates the possibility of a relation between R-value variations and the occurrence of X-class flares in ARs, not in the solar photosphere, as usual, but above it in regions, closer to where flares occur. The modus operandi is to extrapolate the Solar Dynamic Observatory's (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetogram data up to a height of 3.24 Mm above the photosphere and then compute the R-value based on the extrapolated magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that certain flare-predictive parameters such as the horizontal gradient of the vertical magnetic field and magnetic helicity may improve flare prediction lead times significantly if studied at a specific height range above the photosphere, called the Optimal Height Range (OHR). Here we define the OHR as a collection of heights where a sudden but sustained increase in R-value is found. For the eight case studies discussed in this paper, our results indicate that it is possible for OHRs to exist in the low solar atmosphere (between 0.36 - 3.24 Mm), where R-value spikes occur 48-68 hrs before the first X-class flare of an emerging AR. The temporal evolution of R-value before the first X-class flare for an emerging AR is also found to be distinct from that of non-flaring ARs. For X-class flares associated with non-emerging ARs, an OHR could not be found.</description>

      <title>Visibility Analysis of the Sun as Viewed from Multiple Spacecraft at the Sun-Earth Lagrange Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond the Sun-Earth line, spacecraft equipped with various solar telescopes are intended to be deployed at several different vantage points in the heliosphere to carry out coordinated, multi-view observations of the Sun and its dynamic activities. In this context, we investigate solar visibility by imaging instruments onboard the spacecraft orbiting the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L1, L4 and L5, respectively. An optimal arrival time for vertical periodic orbits stationed at L4 and L5 is determined based on geometric considerations that ensure maximum visibility of solar poles or higher latitudes per year. For a different set of orbits around the three Lagrange points (L1, L4 and L5), we calculate the visibility of the solar surface (i.e., observation days per year) as a function of the solar latitude. We also analyze where the solar limb viewed from one of the three Sun-Earth Lagrange points under consideration is projected onto the solar surface visible to the other two. This analysis particularly aims at determining the feasibility of studying solar eruptions, such as flares and coronal mass ejections, with coordinated observations of off-limb erupting coronal structures and their on-disk magnetic footpoints. In addition, visibility analysis of a feature (such as sunspots) on the solar surface is made for multiple spacecraft in various types of orbits with different inclinations to quantify the improvement in continuous tracking of the target feature for studying its long-term evolution from emergence, growth and to decay. A comprehensive comparison of observations from single (L1), double (L1 and L4) and multi-space missions (L1, L4 and L5) is carried out through our solar visibility analysis, and this may help us to design future space missions of constructing multiple solar observatories at the Sun-Earth Lagrange points.</description>
