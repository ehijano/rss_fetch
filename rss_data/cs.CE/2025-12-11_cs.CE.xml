      <title>PILLTOP: Multi-Material Topology Optimization of Polypills for Prescribed Drug-Release Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polypills are single oral dosage forms that combine multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients, enabling fixed-dose combination therapies, coordinated multi-phase release, and precise customization of patient-specific treatment protocols. Recent advances in additive manufacturing facilitate the physical realization of multi-material excipients, offering superior customization of target release profiles. However, polypill formulations remain tuned by ad hoc parameter sweeps; this reliance renders current design workflows ill-suited for the systematic exploration of the high-dimensional space of shapes, compositions, and release behaviors.
  We present an automated design framework for polypills that leverages topology optimization to match dissolution behaviors with prescribed drug release kinetics. In particular, we employ a supershape parametrization to define geometry/phase distribution, a neural network representation to specify excipient distribution, and a coupled system of modified Allen-Cahn and Fick's diffusion equations to govern dissolution kinetics. The framework is implemented in JAX, utilizing automatic differentiation to compute sensitivities for the co-optimization of pill shape and constituent distribution. We validate the method through single-phase and multi-excipient case studies.</description>

      <title>Efficiency-Aware Computational Intelligence for Resource-Constrained Manufacturing Toward Edge-Ready Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial cyber physical systems operate under heterogeneous sensing, stochastic dynamics, and shifting process conditions, producing data that are often incomplete, unlabeled, imbalanced, and domain shifted. High-fidelity datasets remain costly, confidential, and slow to obtain, while edge devices face strict limits on latency, bandwidth, and energy. These factors restrict the practicality of centralized deep learning, hinder the development of reliable digital twins, and increase the risk of error escape in safety-critical applications. Motivated by these challenges, this dissertation develops an efficiency grounded computational framework that enables data lean, physics-aware, and deployment ready intelligence for modern manufacturing environments. The research advances methods that collectively address core bottlenecks across multimodal and multiscale industrial scenarios. Generative strategies mitigate data scarcity and imbalance, while semi-supervised learning integrates unlabeled information to reduce annotation and simulation demands. Physics-informed representation learning strengthens interpretability and improves condition monitoring under small-data regimes. Spatially aware graph-based surrogate modeling provides efficient approximation of complex processes, and an edge cloud collaborative compression scheme supports real-time signal analytics under resource constraints. The dissertation also extends visual understanding through zero-shot vision language reasoning augmented by domain specific retrieval, enabling generalizable assessment in previously unseen scenarios. Together, these developments establish a unified paradigm of data efficient and resource aware intelligence that bridges laboratory learning with industrial deployment, supporting reliable decision-making across diverse manufacturing systems.</description>

      <title>CNFinBench: A Benchmark for Safety and Compliance of Large Language Models in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed across the financial sector for tasks such as research, compliance, risk analysis, and customer service, which makes rigorous safety evaluation essential. However, existing financial benchmarks primarily focus on textbook-style question answering and numerical problem solving, but fail to evaluate models' real-world safety behaviors. They weakly assess regulatory compliance and investor-protection norms, rarely stress-test multi-turn adversarial tactics such as jailbreaks or prompt injection, inconsistently ground answers in long filings, ignore tool- or RAG-induced over-reach risks, and rely on opaque or non-auditable evaluation protocols. To close these gaps, we introduce CNFinBench, a benchmark that employs finance-tailored red-team dialogues and is structured around a Capability-Compliance-Safety triad, including evidence-grounded reasoning over long reports and jurisdiction-aware rule/tax compliance tasks. For systematic safety quantification, we introduce the Harmful Instruction Compliance Score (HICS) to measure how consistently models resist harmful prompts across multi-turn adversarial dialogues. To ensure auditability, CNFinBench enforces strict output formats with dynamic option perturbation for objective tasks and employs a hybrid LLM-ensemble plus human-calibrated judge for open-ended evaluations. Experiments on 21 models across 15 subtasks confirm a persistent capability-compliance gap: models achieve an average score of 61.0 on capability tasks but fall to 34.18 on compliance and risk-control evaluations. Under multi-turn adversarial dialogue tests, most systems reach only partial resistance (HICS 60-79), demonstrating that refusal alone is not a reliable proxy for safety without cited and verifiable reasoning.</description>

      <title>A roadmap of geospatial soil quality analysis systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil quality (SQ) plays a crucial role in sustainable agriculture, environmental conservation, and land-use planning. Traditional SQ assessment techniques rely on costly, labor-intensive sampling and laboratory analysis, limiting their spatial and temporal coverage. Advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and machine learning (ML) enabled efficient SQ evaluation. This paper presents a comprehensive roadmap distinguishing it from previous reviews by proposing a unified and modular pipeline that integrates multi-source soil data, GIS and remote sensing tools, and machine learning techniques to support transparent and scalable soil quality assessment. It also includes practical applications. Contrary to existing studies that predominantly target isolated soil parameters or specific modeling methodologies, this approach consolidates recent advancements in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing technologies, and machine learning algorithms within the entire soil quality assessment pipeline. It also addresses existing challenges and limitations while exploring future developments and emerging trends in the field that can deliver the next generation of soil quality systems making them more transparent, adaptive, and aligned with sustainable land management.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Numerical Differentiation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiation is a cornerstone of computing and data analysis in every discipline of science and engineering. Indeed, most fundamental physics laws are expressed as relationships between derivatives in space and time. However, derivatives are rarely directly measurable and must instead be computed, often from noisy, potentially corrupt data streams. There is a rich and broad literature of computational differentiation algorithms, but many impose extra constraints to work correctly, e.g. periodic boundary conditions, or are compromised in the presence of noise and corruption. It can therefore be challenging to select the method best-suited to any particular problem. Here, we review a broad range of numerical methods for calculating derivatives, present important contextual considerations and choice points, compare relative advantages, and provide basic theory for each algorithm in order to assist users with the mathematical underpinnings. This serves as a practical guide to help scientists and engineers match methods to application domains. We also provide an open-source Python package, PyNumDiff, which contains a broad suite of methods for differentiating noisy data.</description>

      <title>Self Distillation Fine-Tuning of Protein Language Models Improves Versatility in Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for adapting large language models to specialized domains, yet its application to protein sequence modeling and protein language models (PLMs) remains ad hoc. This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family. The supervised fine-tuned model generates sequences that are not only more novel but also display improved characteristics across both targeted design constraints and emergent protein property measures.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction in Transformers for Interpreting TCR-pMHC Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CD8+ "killer" T cells and CD4+ "helper" T cells play a central role in the adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs). Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods; we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.</description>

      <title>RoadBench: A Vision-Language Foundation Model and Benchmark for Road Damage Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate road damage detection is crucial for timely infrastructure maintenance and public safety, but existing vision-only datasets and models lack the rich contextual understanding that textual information can provide. To address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring through multimodal learning.</description>

      <title>Boosting In-Silicon Directed Evolution with Fine-Tuned Protein Language Model and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. Recent advances in protein language models have shown rich evolutionary patterns, offering unprecedented potential for in-silicon directed evolution. However, existing directed evolution methods largely rely on heuristic evolution strategies and have yet to efficiently integrate the transformative protein language models with advanced optimization techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to learn optimal evolution policies. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework that evolves protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models, such as fine-tuning and test-time inference. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility of the interested protein family. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. A case study further demonstrates that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space of avGFP through computational evolution.</description>
