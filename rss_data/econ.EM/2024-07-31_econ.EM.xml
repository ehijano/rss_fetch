      <title>On the power properties of inference for parameters with interval identified sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a specific inference problem for a partially-identified parameter of interest with an interval identified set. We consider the favorable situation in which a researcher has two possible estimators to construct the confidence interval proposed in Imbens and Manski (2004) and Stoye (2009), and one is more efficient than the other. While the literature shows that both estimators deliver asymptotically exact confidence intervals for the parameter of interest, their inference in terms of statistical power is not compared. One would expect that using the more efficient estimator would result in more powerful inference. We formally prove this result.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Adaptive Experiments: A Unified Approach to Regret Minimization and Best-Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Practitioners conducting adaptive experiments often encounter two competing priorities: maximizing total welfare (or `reward') through effective treatment assignment and swiftly concluding experiments to implement population-wide treatments. Current literature addresses these priorities separately, with regret minimization studies focusing on the former and best-arm identification research on the latter. This paper bridges this divide by proposing a unified model that simultaneously accounts for within-experiment performance and post-experiment outcomes. We provide a sharp theory of optimal performance in large populations that not only unifies canonical results in the literature but also uncovers novel insights. Our theory reveals that familiar algorithms, such as the recently proposed top-two Thompson sampling algorithm, can optimize a broad class of objectives if a single scalar parameter is appropriately adjusted. In addition, we demonstrate that substantial reductions in experiment duration can often be achieved with minimal impact on both within-experiment and post-experiment regret.</description>
