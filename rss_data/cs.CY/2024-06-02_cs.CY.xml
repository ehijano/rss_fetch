      <title>Unravelling the Use of Digital Twins to Assist Decision- and Policy-Making in Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short paper represents a systematic literature review that sets the basis for the future development of a framework for digital twin-based decision support in the public sector, specifically for the smart city domain. The final aim of the research is to model context-specific digital twins for aiding the decision-making processes in smart cities and devise methods for defining the policy agenda. Overall, this short paper provides a foundation, based on the main concepts from existing literature, for further research in the role and applications of urban digital twins to assist decision- and policy-making in smart cities. The existing literature analyses common applications of digital twins in smart city development with a focus on supporting decision- and policy-making. Future work will centre on developing a digital-twin-based sustainable smart city and defining different scenarios concerning challenges of good governance, especially so-called wicked problems, in smaller-scale urban and non-urban contexts.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Next Location Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the locations an individual will visit in the future is crucial for solving many societal issues like disease diffusion and reduction of pollution among many others. The models designed to tackle next-location prediction, however, require a significant amount of individual-level information to be trained effectively. Such data may be scarce or even unavailable in some geographic regions or peculiar scenarios (e.g., cold-start in recommendation systems). Moreover, the design of a next-location predictor able to generalize or geographically transfer knowledge is still an open research challenge. Recent advances in natural language processing have led to a rapid diffusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) which have shown good generalization and reasoning capabilities. These insights, coupled with the recent findings that LLMs are rich in geographical knowledge, allowed us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. This paper evaluates the capabilities of many popular LLMs in this role, specifically Llama, GPT-3.5 and Mistral 7B. After designing a proper prompt, we tested the models on three real-world mobility datasets. The results show that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 32.4%, a significant relative improvement of over 600% when compared to sophisticated DL models specifically designed for human mobility. Moreover, we show that other LLMs are unable to perform the task properly. To prevent positively biased results, we also propose a framework inspired by other studies to test data contamination. Finally, we explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for next-location prediction showing that can effectively provide an explanation for their decision. Notably, 7B models provide more generic, but still reliable, explanations compared to larger counterparts. Code: github.com/ssai-trento/LLM-zero-shot-NL</description>

      <title>The rising costs of training frontier AI models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The costs of training frontier AI models have grown dramatically in recent years, but there is limited public data on the magnitude and growth of these expenses. This paper develops a detailed cost model to address this gap, estimating training costs using three approaches that account for hardware, energy, cloud rental, and staff expenses. The analysis reveals that the amortized cost to train the most compute-intensive models has grown precipitously at a rate of 2.4x per year since 2016 (95% CI: 2.0x to 3.1x). For key frontier models, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, the most significant expenses are AI accelerator chips and staff costs, each costing tens of millions of dollars. Other notable costs include server components (15-22%), cluster-level interconnect (9-13%), and energy consumption (2-6%). If the trend of growing development costs continues, the largest training runs will cost more than a billion dollars by 2027, meaning that only the most well-funded organizations will be able to finance frontier AI models.</description>

      <title>Hallucination-Free? Assessing the Reliability of Leading AI Legal Research Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal practice has witnessed a sharp rise in products incorporating artificial intelligence (AI). Such tools are designed to assist with a wide range of core legal tasks, from search and summarization of caselaw to document drafting. But the large language models used in these tools are prone to "hallucinate," or make up false information, making their use risky in high-stakes domains. Recently, certain legal research providers have touted methods such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as "eliminating" (Casetext, 2023) or "avoid[ing]" hallucinations (Thomson Reuters, 2023), or guaranteeing "hallucination-free" legal citations (LexisNexis, 2023). Because of the closed nature of these systems, systematically assessing these claims is challenging. In this article, we design and report on the first preregistered empirical evaluation of AI-driven legal research tools. We demonstrate that the providers' claims are overstated. While hallucinations are reduced relative to general-purpose chatbots (GPT-4), we find that the AI research tools made by LexisNexis (Lexis+ AI) and Thomson Reuters (Westlaw AI-Assisted Research and Ask Practical Law AI) each hallucinate between 17% and 33% of the time. We also document substantial differences between systems in responsiveness and accuracy. Our article makes four key contributions. It is the first to assess and report the performance of RAG-based proprietary legal AI tools. Second, it introduces a comprehensive, preregistered dataset for identifying and understanding vulnerabilities in these systems. Third, it proposes a clear typology for differentiating between hallucinations and accurate legal responses. Last, it provides evidence to inform the responsibilities of legal professionals in supervising and verifying AI outputs, which remains a central open question for the responsible integration of AI into law.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Fairness in Performative Policy Learning: Escaping the Impossibility of Group Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many prediction problems, the predictive model affects the distribution of the prediction target. This phenomenon is known as performativity and is often caused by the behavior of individuals with vested interests in the outcome of the predictive model. Although performativity is generally problematic because it manifests as distribution shifts, we develop algorithmic fairness practices that leverage performativity to achieve stronger group fairness guarantees in social classification problems (compared to what is achievable in non-performative settings). In particular, we leverage the policymaker's ability to steer the population to remedy inequities in the long term. A crucial benefit of this approach is that it is possible to resolve the incompatibilities between conflicting group fairness definitions.</description>

      <title>Online network topology shapes personal narratives and hashtag generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While narratives have shaped cognition and cultures for centuries, digital media and online social networks have introduced new narrative phenomena. With increased narrative agency, networked groups of individuals can directly contribute and steer narratives that center our collective discussions of politics, science, and morality. We report the results of an online network experiment on narrative and hashtag generation, in which networked groups of participants interpreted a text-based narrative of a disaster event, and were incentivized to produce matching hashtags with their network neighbors. We found that network structure not only influences the emergence of dominant beliefs through coordination with network neighbors, but also impacts participants' use of causal language in their personal narratives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss how reinforcement learning (RL) provides an effective and efficient framework for solving sociohydrology problems. The efficacy of RL for these types of problems is evident because of its ability to update policies in an iterative manner - something that is also foundational to sociohydrology, where we are interested in representing the co-evolution of human-water interactions. We present a simple case study to demonstrate the implementation of RL in a problem of runoff reduction through management decisions related to changes in land-use land-cover (LULC). We then discuss the benefits of RL for these types of problems and share our perspectives on the future research directions in this area.</description>

      <title>How the Future Works at SOUPS: Analyzing Future Work Statements and Their Impact on Usable Security and Privacy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending knowledge by identifying and investigating valuable research questions and problems is a core function of research. Research publications often suggest avenues for future work to extend and build upon their results. Considering these suggestions can contribute to developing research ideas that build upon previous work and produce results that tie into existing knowledge. Usable security and privacy researchers commonly add future work statements to their publications. However, our community lacks an in-depth understanding of their prevalence, quality, and impact on future research.
  Our work aims to address this gap in the research literature. We reviewed all 27 papers from the 2019 SOUPS proceedings and analyzed their future work statements. Additionally, we analyzed 978 publications that cite any paper from SOUPS 2019 proceedings to assess their future work statements' impact. We find that most papers from the SOUPS 2019 proceedings include future work statements. However, they are often unspecific or ambiguous, and not always easy to find. Therefore, the citing publications often matched the future work statements' content thematically, but rarely explicitly acknowledged them, indicating a limited impact. We conclude with recommendations for the usable security and privacy community to improve the utility of future work statements by making them more tangible and actionable, and avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>Intersectional Unfairness Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems have been shown to produce unfair results for certain subgroups of population, highlighting the need to understand bias on certain sensitive attributes. Current research often falls short, primarily focusing on the subgroups characterized by a single sensitive attribute, while neglecting the nature of intersectional fairness of multiple sensitive attributes. This paper focuses on its one fundamental aspect by discovering diverse high-bias subgroups under intersectional sensitive attributes. Specifically, we propose a Bias-Guided Generative Network (BGGN). By treating each bias value as a reward, BGGN efficiently generates high-bias intersectional sensitive attributes. Experiments on real-world text and image datasets demonstrate a diverse and efficient discovery of BGGN. To further evaluate the generated unseen but possible unfair intersectional sensitive attributes, we formulate them as prompts and use modern generative AI to produce new texts and images. The results of frequently generating biased data provides new insights of discovering potential unfairness in popular modern generative AI systems. Warning: This paper contains generative examples that are offensive in nature.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: The AI Alignment Paradox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of AI alignment aims to steer AI systems toward human goals, preferences, and ethical principles. Its contributions have been instrumental for improving the output quality, safety, and trustworthiness of today's AI models. This perspective article draws attention to a fundamental challenge inherent in all AI alignment endeavors, which we term the "AI alignment paradox": The better we align AI models with our values, the easier we make it for adversaries to misalign the models. We illustrate the paradox by sketching three concrete example incarnations for the case of language models, each corresponding to a distinct way in which adversaries can exploit the paradox. With AI's increasing real-world impact, it is imperative that a broad community of researchers be aware of the AI alignment paradox and work to find ways to break out of it, in order to ensure the beneficial use of AI for the good of humanity.</description>

      <title>Responsible AI for Earth Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and Earth observation (EO) technologies has brought geoscience and remote sensing into an era of unparalleled capabilities. AI's transformative impact on data analysis, particularly derived from EO platforms, holds great promise in addressing global challenges such as environmental monitoring, disaster response and climate change analysis. However, the rapid integration of AI necessitates a careful examination of the responsible dimensions inherent in its application within these domains. In this paper, we represent a pioneering effort to systematically define the intersection of AI and EO, with a central focus on responsible AI practices. Specifically, we identify several critical components guiding this exploration from both academia and industry perspectives within the EO field: AI and EO for social good, mitigating unfair biases, AI security in EO, geo-privacy and privacy-preserving measures, as well as maintaining scientific excellence, open data, and guiding AI usage based on ethical principles. Furthermore, the paper explores potential opportunities and emerging trends, providing valuable insights for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models: A New Approach for Privacy Policy Analysis at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number and dynamic nature of web and mobile applications presents significant challenges for assessing their compliance with data protection laws. In this context, symbolic and statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been employed for the automated analysis of these systems' privacy policies. However, these techniques typically require labor-intensive and potentially error-prone manually annotated datasets for training and validation. This research proposes the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative for effectively and efficiently extracting privacy practices from privacy policies at scale. Particularly, we leverage well-known LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama 2, and offer guidance on the optimal design of prompts, parameters, and models, incorporating advanced strategies such as few-shot learning. We further illustrate its capability to detect detailed and varied privacy practices accurately. Using several renowned datasets in the domain as a benchmark, our evaluation validates its exceptional performance, achieving an F1 score exceeding 93%. Besides, it does so with reduced costs, faster processing times, and fewer technical knowledge requirements. Consequently, we advocate for LLM-based solutions as a sound alternative to traditional NLP techniques for the automated analysis of privacy policies at scale.</description>

      <title>A Perspective Study on Chinese Social Media regarding LLM for Education and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of AI-powered tools has piqued the interest of many fields, particularly in the academic community. This study uses ChatGPT, currently the most powerful and popular AI tool, as a representative example to analyze how the Chinese public perceives the potential of large language models (LLMs) for educational and general purposes. Although facing accessibility challenges, we found that the number of discussions on ChatGPT per month is 16 times that of Ernie Bot developed by Baidu, the most popular alternative product to ChatGPT in the mainland, making ChatGPT a more suitable subject for our analysis. The study also serves as the first effort to investigate the changes in public opinion as AI technologies become more advanced and intelligent. The analysis reveals that, upon first encounters with advanced AI that was not yet highly capable, some social media users believed that AI advancements would benefit education and society, while others feared that advanced AI, like ChatGPT, would make humans feel inferior and lead to problems such as cheating and a decline in moral principles. The majority of users remained neutral. Interestingly, with the rapid development and improvement of AI capabilities, public attitudes have tended to shift in a positive direction. We present a thorough analysis of the trending shift and a roadmap to ensure the ethical application of ChatGPT-like models in education and beyond.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Knowledge Tracing via Response Influence-based Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided education and intelligent tutoring systems, aiming to assess students' knowledge proficiency by predicting their future performance on new questions based on their past response records. While existing deep learning knowledge tracing (DLKT) methods have significantly improved prediction accuracy and achieved state-of-the-art results, they often suffer from a lack of interpretability. To address this limitation, current approaches have explored incorporating psychological influences to achieve more explainable predictions, but they tend to overlook the potential influences of historical responses. In fact, understanding how models make predictions based on response influences can enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of the knowledge tracing process, presenting an opportunity for a new paradigm of interpretable KT. However, measuring unobservable response influences is challenging. In this paper, we resort to counterfactual reasoning that intervenes in each response to answer \textit{what if a student had answered a question incorrectly that he/she actually answered correctly, and vice versa}. Based on this, we propose RCKT, a novel response influence-based counterfactual knowledge tracing framework. RCKT generates response influences by comparing prediction outcomes from factual sequences and constructed counterfactual sequences after interventions. Additionally, we introduce maximization and inference techniques to leverage accumulated influences from different past responses, further improving the model's performance and credibility. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our RCKT method outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods on four datasets against six baselines, and provides credible interpretations of response influences.</description>

      <title>Distributed agency in second language learning and teaching through generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI offers significant opportunities for language learning. Tools like ChatGPT can provide informal second language practice through chats in written or voice forms, with the learner specifying through prompts conversational parameters such as proficiency level, language register, and discussion topics. AI can be instructed to give corrective feedback, create practice exercises, or develop an extended study plan. Instructors can use AI to build learning and assessment materials in a variety of media. AI is likely to make immersive technologies more powerful and versatile, moving away from scripted interactions. For both learners and teachers, it is important to understand the limitations of AI systems that arise from their purely statistical model of human language, which limits their ability to deal with nuanced social and cultural aspects of language use. Additionally, there are ethical concerns over how AI systems are created as well as practical constraints in their use, especially for less privileged populations. The power and versatility of AI tools are likely to turn them into valuable and constant companions in many peoples lives (akin to smartphones), creating a close connection that goes beyond simple tool use. Ecological theories such as sociomaterialism are helpful in examining the shared agency that develops through close user-AI interactions, as are the perspectives on human-object relations from Indigenous cultures.</description>

      <title>The Earth is Flat because...: Investigating LLMs' Belief towards Misinformation via Persuasive Conversation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate vast amounts of knowledge but still remain vulnerable to external misinformation. Existing research mainly studied this susceptibility behavior in a single-turn setting. However, belief can change during a multi-turn conversation, especially a persuasive one. Therefore, in this study, we delve into LLMs' susceptibility to persuasive conversations, particularly on factual questions that they can answer correctly. We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs' belief changes in a persuasive dialogue. Through extensive experiments, we find that LLMs' correct beliefs on factual knowledge can be easily manipulated by various persuasive strategies.</description>

      <title>Not Just Novelty: A Longitudinal Study on Utility and Customization of an AI Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09894</link>

Abstract: Generative AI brings novel and impressive abilities to help people in everyday tasks. There are many AI workflows that solve real and complex problems by chaining AI outputs together with human interaction. Although there is an undeniable lure of AI, it is uncertain how useful generative AI workflows are after the novelty wears off. Additionally, workflows built with generative AI have the potential to be easily customized to fit users' individual needs, but do users take advantage of this? We conducted a three-week longitudinal study with 12 users to understand the familiarization and customization of generative AI tools for science communication. Our study revealed that there exists a familiarization phase, during which users were exploring the novel capabilities of the workflow and discovering which aspects they found useful. After this phase, users understood the workflow and were able to anticipate the outputs. Surprisingly, after familiarization the perceived utility of the system was rated higher than before, indicating that the perceived utility of AI is not just a novelty effect. The increase in benefits mainly comes from end-users' ability to customize prompts, and thus potentially appropriate the system to their own needs. This points to a future where generative AI systems can allow us to design for appropriation.</description>

      <title>Perceived Social Influence on Vaccination Decisions: A COVID-19 Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the perceived influence of others, across both strong and weak social ties, on COVID-19 vaccination decisions in the United States. We add context to social influence by measuring related concepts, such as perceived agreement of others and perceived danger of COVID-19 to others. We find that vaccinated populations perceived more influence from their social circles than unvaccinated populations. This finding holds true across various social groups, including family, close friends, and neighbors. Vaccinated participants perceived that others agreed with their decision to get vaccinated more than unvaccinated participants perceived others to agree with their decision to not get vaccinated. Despite the clear differences in perceived social influence and agreement across the groups, the majority of participants across both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations perceived no social influence from all social group in their decisions. Aligning with this result, we find through open-ended responses that both vaccinated and unvaccinated participants frequently cited fear as a motivating factor in their decision, rather than social influence: vaccinated participants feared COVID-19, while unvaccinated participants feared the vaccine itself.</description>
