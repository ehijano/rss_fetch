      <title>Homotopy Type of the Space of Fibrations of the Three-sphere by Simple Closed Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the moduli space of all smooth fibrations of a three-sphere by simple closed curves has the homotopy type of a disjoint union of a pair of two-spheres if the fibers are oriented, and of a pair of real projective planes if unoriented, the same as for its finite-dimensional subspace of Hopf fibrations by parallel great circles. This moduli space is the quotient of the diffeomorphism group of the three-sphere (a Fr\'echet Lie group) by its subgroup of automorphisms of the Hopf fibration, which we show is a smooth Fr\'echet submanifold of the diffeomorphism group. Then we show that the moduli space, already known to be a Fr\'echet manifold by [HKMR12], can be modeled on the concrete Fr\'echet space of vector fields on the three-sphere which are "horizontal" and "balanced" with respect to a given Hopf fibration, and see how the structure of this moduli space helps us to determine its homotopy type.</description>

      <title>Topology of boundary special generic maps into Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study global properties of boundary special generic maps. A boundary special generic map is defined as a submersion of a compact connected manifold with non-empty boundary into Euclidean spaces, in which all singular points of its restriction to the boundary are boundary definite fold points. In certain dimensions, we characterize the manifolds with boundary that admit such maps up to diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s with Compactly Supported Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exotic copies of $\mathbb{R}^4$ with nontrivial compactly supported mapping class groups of arbitrarily large rank. This follows from a modification of the construction of the diffeomorphism corks of arXiv:2407.04696 that makes their exteriors simply-connected.</description>

      <title>Kauffman bracket polynomials, perfect matchings and cluster variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of links whose bracket polynomials admit an expansion over perfect matchings of a plane bipartite graph. This class includes 2-bridge links, pretzel links, and Montesinos links. Our first main result (Theorem A) provides a partial answer to a question posed by Kauffman concerning the connection between spanning tree expansions of the Jones polynomial and the Clock Theorem. Building on Theorem A, we apply our framework to cluster theory and prove in Theorem B that the bracket polynomials of links in this class can be realized as specializations of the F-polynomials of certain cluster variables. Theorem B generalizes several earlier results. We also present several applications and illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Cyclic orders and actions of Leary--Minasyan groups on coarse $\mathrm{PD}(n)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for $n \geq 3$, there are torsion-free CAT(0) groups with visual boundaries that embed into $S^n$ but which are not virtually the fundamental group of a compact aspherical $n+1$-manifold. The groups are the CAT(0) and not bi-automatic groups constructed previously by Leary and Minasyan. The obstruction comes from analyzing certain cyclic orders on the boundary of the Bass-Serre tree, in the same manner as Kapovich-Kleiner ruled out actions of Baumslag-Solitar groups on coarse $\mathrm{PD}(3)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures of Vassiliev invariants for knot families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore algebraic relations on Vassiliev knot invariants expressed through correlators in the 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Vassiliev invariants form an infinite-dimensional algebra. We focus on $k$-parametric knot families with Vassiliev invariants being polynomials in family parameters. It turns out that such a 1-parametric algebra of Vassiliev invariants is always finitely generated, while in the case of more parameters, the number of generators can be infinite. Inside a knot family, there appear extra algebraic relations on Vassiliev invariants. We show that there are $\leq k$ algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants for a $k$-parametric knot family. However, in all our examples, the number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants is exactly $k$, and it is an open question if there exists a $k$-parametric knot family with a fewer number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants. We also demonstrate that a complete knot invariant of some $k$-parametric knot families consists of $\leq k$ Vassiliev invariants. Again, we have only examples of a set of $k$ Vassiliev invariants being a complete invariant of a $k$-parametric knot family. Currently, it is unknown whether a set of a fewer number of Vassiliev invariants cannot be a complete knot family invariant.</description>

      <title>Summing over homology groups of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a toy model of a 3-dimensional topological quantum gravity. In this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum, that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently for each prime $p$.</description>

      <title>Nonsimple closed geodesics with given intersection number on hyperbolic surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the minimal length of a closed geodesic with self-intersection number $k$ on any finite-type hyperbolic surface is $2\cosh^{-1}(1+2k)$ for $k&gt;1750$. This improves the previously known threshold $k &gt; 10^{13350}$. Our proof is independent of it.</description>

      <title>Minimal cobordisms between thin and thick torus knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the locally flat cobordism distance between torus knots with small and large braid index, up to high precision. Here small means 2, 3, 4, or 6. As an application, we derive a surprising fact about torus knots that appear as cross-sections of almost minimal cobordisms between two-stranded torus knots and the trivial knot.</description>

      <title>Volume bounds for hyperbolic rod complements in the 3-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of rod complements is motivated by rod packing structures in crystallography. We view them as complements of links comprised of Euclidean geodesics in the 3-torus. Recent work of the second author classifies when such rod complements admit hyperbolic structures, but their geometric properties are yet to be well understood. In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds for the volumes of all hyperbolic rod complements in terms of rod parameters, and show that these bounds may be loose in general. We introduce better and asymptotically sharp volume bounds for a family of rod complements. The bounds depend only on the lengths of the continued fractions formed from the rod parameters.</description>

Abstract: We study the homeomorphism types of certain covers of (always orientable) surfaces, usually of infinite-type. We show that every surface with non-abelian fundamental group is covered by every noncompact surface, we identify the universal abelian covers and the $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$-homology covers of surfaces, and we show that non-locally finite characteristic covers of surfaces have four possible homeomorphism types.</description>

      <title>Good involutions of conjugation subquandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Posed by Taniguchi, the classification of quandles with good involutions is a difficult question with applications to surface-knot theory. We address this question for subquandles of conjugation quandles, including all core quandles. We also study good involutions of faithful racks. In particular, we obtain sharp bounds on the number of good involutions of racks in these families.
  As an application of our results, we implement group-theoretic algorithms that compute all good involutions of conjugation quandles and core quandles; we provide data for those up to order 23. As another application, we construct infinite families of connected, noninvolutory symmetric quandles.
  We also classify symmetric and Legendrian racks, quandles, and kei up to order 8 using a computer search. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks that induces an equivalence between involutory racks, Legendrian kei, and symmetric kei.</description>

      <title>Topology and Algebra of Bonded Knots and Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed study of \emph{bonded knots} and their related structures, integrating recent developments into a single framework. Bonded knots are classical knots endowed with embedded bonding arcs modeling physical or chemical bonds. We consider bonded knots in three categories (long, standard, and tight) according to the type of bonds, and in two categories, topological vertex and rigid vertex, according to the allowed isotopy moves, and we define invariants for each category. We then develop the theory of \emph{bonded braids}, the algebraic counterpart of bonded knots. We define the {\it bonded braid monoid}, with its generators and relations, and formulate the analogues of the Alexander and Markov theorems for bonded braids, including an $L$-equivalence for bonded braids. Next, we introduce \emph{enhanced bonded knots and braids}, incorporating two types of bonds (attracting and repelling) corresponding to different interactions. We define the enhanced bonded braid group and show how the bonded braid monoid embeds into this group. Finally, we study \emph{bonded knotoids}, which are open knot diagrams with bonds, and their closure operations, and we define the \emph{bonded closure}. We introduce \emph{bonded braidoids} as the algebraic counterpart of bonded knotoids. These models capture the topology of open chains with inter and intra-chain bonds and suggest new invariants for classifying biological macromolecules.</description>
