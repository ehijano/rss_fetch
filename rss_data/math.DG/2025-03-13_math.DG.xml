      <title>Quantitative Stability for Yamabe minimizers on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the quantitative stability for a Yamabe-type functional on compact manifolds with boundary introduced by Escobar. Minimizers of the functional correspond to scalar-flat metrics with constant mean curvature on the boundary. We prove that the deficit controls the distance to the minimizing set to a suitable power by reducing the problem to the analogous question for an effective functional on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Principaloid bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel generalisation of principal bundles -- principaloid bundles: These are fibre bundles $\pi:P\to B$ where the typical fibre is the arrow manifold $G$ of a Lie groupoid $G\rightrightarrows M$ and the structure group is reduced to the latter's group of bisections. Each such bundle canonically comes with a bundle map $D:P\to F$ to another fibre bundle $F$ over the base $B$, with typical fibre $M$. Examples of principaloid bundles include ordinary principal $\underline G$-bundles, obtained for $G:=\underline G\rightrightarrows\bullet$, bundles associated to them, obtained for action groupoids $G:=\underline G\ltimes M$, and general fibre bundles if $G$ is a pair groupoid.
  While $\pi$ is far from being a principal $G$-bundle, we prove that $D$ is one. Connections on the principaloid bundle $\pi$ are thus required to be $G$-invariant Ehresmann connections. In the three examples mentioned above, this reproduces the usual types of connection for each of them. In a local description over a trivialising cover $\{O_i\}$ of $B$, the connection gives rise to Lie algebroid-valued objects living over bundle trivialisations $\{O_i\times M\}$ of $F$. Their behaviour under bundle automorphisms, including gauge transformations, is studied in detail.
  Finally, we construct the Atiyah-Ehresmann groupoid ${\rm At}(P)\rightrightarrows F$ which governs symmetries of $P$, this time mapping distinct $D$-fibres to one another in general. It is a fibre-bundle object in the category of Lie groupoids, with typical fibre $G\rightrightarrows M$ and base $B\times B\rightrightarrows B$. We show that those of its bisections which project to bisections of its base are in a one-to-one correspondence with automorphisms of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Connectedness on Statistical Manifolds with Divisible Cubic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of statistical manifolds with divisible cubic forms arises from affine differential geometry. We examine the geodesic connectedness of affine connections on this class of statistical manifolds. In information geometry, the geodesic connectedness of the affine connections are often assumed, as in the generalized Pythagorean theorem. In Riemannian geometry, the geodesic connectedness of the Levi-Civita connection follows from its geodesic completeness by the well-known Hopf-Rinow theorem. However, the geodesic connectedness of general affine connections is more challenging to achieve, even for the Levi-Civita connection in pseudo-Riemannian geometry or for affine connections on compact manifolds. By analogy with the Hopf-Rinow theorem in Riemannian geometry, we establish the geodesic connectedness of the affine connections on statistical manifolds with divisible cubic forms from their geodesic completeness. As an application, we establish a Cartan-Hadamard type theorem for statistical manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for operator fields in small dimensions and Tempesta-Tondo conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for an operator field in small dimensions. In dimensions three and four, we find tensorial conditions for an operator field $L$, similar to a nilpotent Jordan block, to possess local coordinates in which $L$ takes a strictly upper triangular form. We prove the Tempesta-Tondo conjecture for higher order brackets of Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis type.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

      <title>Characterization of geodesic completeness for landmark space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a full characterization of geodesic completeness for spaces of configurations of landmarks with smooth Riemannian metrics that satisfy a rotational and translation invariance and which are induced from metrics on subgroups of the diffeomorphism group for the shape domain. These spaces are widely used for applications in shape analysis, for example, for measuring shape changes in medical imaging and morphometrics in biology. For statistics of such data to be well-defined, it is imperative to know if geodesics exist for all times. We extend previously known sufficient conditions for geodesic completeness based on the regularity of the metric to give a full characterization for smooth Riemannian metrics with a rotational and translation invariance by means of an integrability criterion that involves only the behavior of the cometric kernel as landmarks approach collision. We further use the integrability criterion for geodesic completeness and previous work on stochastic completeness to construct a family of Riemannian landmark manifolds that are geodesically complete but stochastically incomplete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper defines coherent manifolds and discusses their properties and their application in quantum mechanics. Every coherent manifold with a large group of symmetries gives rise to a Hilbert space, the completed quantum space of $Z$, which contains a distinguished family of coherent states labeled by the points of the manifold.
  The second quantization map in quantum field theory is generalized to quantization operators on arbitrary coherent manifolds. It is shown how the Schr\"odinger equation on any such completed quantum space can be solved in terms of computations only involving the coherent product. In particular, this applies to a description of Bosonic Fock spaces as completed quantum spaces of a class of coherent manifolds called Klauder spaces.</description>

      <title>Flux homomorphism and bilinear form constructed from Shelukhin's quasimorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a closed connected symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$, we construct an alternating $\mathbb{R}$-bilinear form $\mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{b}_{\mu_{\mathrm{Sh}}}$ on the real first cohomology of $M$ from Shelukhin's quasimorphism $\mu_{\mathrm{Sh}}$. Here $\mu_{\mathrm{Sh}}$ is defined on the universal cover of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on $(M,\omega)$. This bilinear form is invariant under the symplectic mapping class group action, and $\mathfrak{b}$ yields a constraint on the fluxes of commuting two elements in the group of symplectomorphisms on $(M,\omega)$. These results might be seen as an analog of Rousseau's result for an open connected symplectic manifold, where he recovered the symplectic pairing from the Calabi homomorphism. Furthermore, $\mathfrak{b}$ controls the extendability of Shelukhin's quasimorphisms, as well as the triviality of a characteristic class of Reznikov. To construct $\mathfrak{b}$, we build general machinery for a group $G$ of producing a real-valued $\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form $\mathfrak{b}_{\mu}$ from a $G$-invariant quasimorphism $\mu$ on the commutator subgroup of $G$.</description>

Abstract: Dix formulated the inverse problem of recovering an elastic body from the measurements of wave fronts of point sources. We geometrize this problem in the context of seismology, leading to the geometrical inverse problem of recovering a Finsler manifold from certain sphere data in a given open subset of the manifold. We solve this problem locally along any geodesic through the measurement set.</description>

      <title>Chambered invariants of real Cauchy-Riemann operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by counting pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic Calabi-Yau $3$-folds, this article studies a chamber structure in the space of real Cauchy-Riemann operators on a Riemann surface, and constructs three chambered invariants associated with such operators: $n_{\mathrm{Bl}}$, $n_{1,2}$, $n_{2,1}$. The first of these invariants is defined by counting pseudo-holomorphic sections of bundles whose fibres are modeled on the blow-up of $\mathbf{C}^2/\{\pm 1\}$. The other two are defined by counting solutions to the ADHM vortex equations. The authors believe that $n_{1,2}$ and $n_{2,1}$ are related to putative symplectic invariants generalizing the Pandharipande-Thomas and rank $2$ Donaldson-Thomas invariants of projective Calabi-Yau $3$-folds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A projective structure is Weyl metrizable if it has a representative that preserves a conformal structure. We interpret Weyl metrizability of 3-dimensional projective structures as certain 5-dimensional nondegenerate CR submanifolds in a class of 7-dimensional 2-nondegenerate CR structures. As a corollary, it follows that in dimension three Beltrami's theorem extends to conformal structures, i.e. a flat projective structure is Weyl metrizable exclusively with respect to a flat conformal structure. In higher dimensions it is shown that conformal Beltrami theorem remains true as well.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate critical quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations on a complete Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. By exploiting a new and sharp nonlinear Kato inequality and establishing some Cheng-Yau type gradient estimates for positive solutions, we classify positive solutions to the critical $p$-Laplace equation and show rigidity concerning the ambient manifold. Our results extend and improve some previous conclusions in the literature. Similar results are obtained for solutions to the quasilinear Liouville equation involving the $n$-Laplace operator, where $n$ corresponds to the dimension of the ambient manifold.</description>

      <title>An estimation of the Gauss curvature and the modified defect relation for the Gauss map of immersed harmonic surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the estimation of Gauss curvature for $K$-quasiconformal harmonic surface in ${\mathbb R}^3$ and present an accurate improvement of the previous result in [6, Theorem 5.2]. Let $X:M\rightarrow{\mathbb R}^3$ denote a $K$-quasiconformal harmonic surface and let $\mathfrak{n}$ be the unit normal map of $M$. We define $d(p)$ as the distance from point $p$ to the boundary of $M$ and $\mathcal{K}(p)$ as the Gauss curvature of $M$ at $p$. Assuming that the Gauss map (i.e., the normal $\mathfrak{n}$) omits $7$ directions $\mathbf{d}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{d}_7$ in $S^2$ with the property that any three of these directions are not contained in a plane in ${\mathbb R}^3$. Then there exists a positive constant $C$ depending only on $\mathbf{d}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{d}_7$ such that \begin{equation*} |\mathcal{K}(p)|\leq C/d(p)^2 \end{equation*} for all points $p\in M$. Furthermore, a modified defect relation for the generalized Gauss map of the immersed harmonic surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n(n\geq 3)$ is verified.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a theory for gravity coupled with scalar, SU$(n)$ and spinor fields on manifolds with null-boundary. We perform the symplectic reduction of the space of boundary fields and give the constraints of the theory in terms of local functionals of boundary vielbein and connection. For the three different couplings, the analysis of the constraint algebra shows that the set of constraints does not form a first class system.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>
