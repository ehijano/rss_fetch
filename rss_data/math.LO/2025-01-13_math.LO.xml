      <title>Derived Models in PFA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a conjecture of Wilson that under the proper forcing axiom, $\Theta_0$ of the derived model at $\kappa$ is below $\kappa^+$. We prove the conjecture holds for the old derived model. Assuming mouse capturing in the new derived model, the conjecture holds there as well. We also show $\Theta &lt; \kappa^+$ in the case of the old derived model, and under additional hypotheses for the new derived model.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Linear Equations and Infinite Gadgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the descriptive set-theoretic complexity of the solvability of a Borel family of linear equations over a finite field. Answering a question of Thornton, we show that this problem is already hard, namely $\Sigma^1_2$-complete. This implies that the split between easy and hard problems is at a different place in the Borel setting than in the case of the CSP Dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Adjointable maps between linear orthosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an (anisotropic) Hermitian space $H$, the collection $P(H)$ of at most one-dimensional subspaces of $H$, equipped with the orthogonal relation $\perp$ and the zero linear subspace $\{0\}$, is a linear orthoset and up to orthoisomorphism any linear orthoset of rank $\geq 4$ arises in this way. We investigate in this paper the correspondence of structure-preserving maps between Hermitian spaces on the one hand and between the associated linear orthosets on the other hand. Our particular focus is on adjointable maps.
  We show that, under a mild assumption, adjointable maps between linear orthosets are induced by quasilinear maps between Hermitian spaces and if the latter are linear, they are adjointable as well. Specialised versions of this correlation lead to Wigner-type theorems; we see, for instance, that orthoisomorphisms between the orthosets associated with at least $3$-dimensional Hermitian spaces are induced by quasiunitary maps.
  In addition, we point out that orthomodular spaces of dimension $\geq 4$ can be characterised as irreducible Fr\'echet orthosets such that the inclusion map of any subspace is adjointable. Together with a transitivity condition, we may in this way describe the infinite-dimensional classical Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>A weak version of the Strong Exponential Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.10241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming Schanuel's Conjecture we prove that for any variety V over the algebraic closure over the rational numbers, of dimension n and with dominant projections, there exists a generic point in V. We obtain in this way many instances of the Strong Exponential Closure introduced by Zilber.</description>

      <title>Iterating reflection over intuitionistic arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this expository note, we study iterations of consistency, local and uniform reflection over $\mathbf{HA}$ (Heyting Arithmetic). In the case of uniform reflection, we give a new proof of Dragalin's extension of Feferman's completeness theorem to $\mathbf{HA}$. The treatment of uniform reflection is inspired by a proof of Feferman's completeness theorem due to Rathjen.</description>

      <title>On first-order transductions of classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14412v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various aspects of the first-order transduction quasi-order on graph classes, which provides a way of measuring the relative complexity of graph classes based on whether one can encode the other using a formula of first-order (FO) logic. In contrast with the conjectured simplicity of the transduction quasi-order for monadic second-order logic, the FO-transduction quasi-order is very complex, and many standard properties from structural graph theory and model theory naturally appear in it. We prove a local normal form for transductions among other general results and constructions, which we illustrate via several examples and via the characterizations of the transductions of some simple classes. We then turn to various aspects of the quasi-order, including the (non-)existence of minimum and maximum classes for certain properties, the strictness of the pathwidth hierarchy, the fact that the quasi-order is not a lattice, and the role of weakly sparse classes in the quasi-order.</description>

      <title>Arrow algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures which induce elementary toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction. This includes localic toposes as well as various realizability toposes, in particular, those realizability toposes which are obtained from partial combinatory algebras. Since there are many examples of arrow algebras and arrow algebras have a number of closure properties, including a notion of subalgebra given by a nucleus, arrow algebras provide a flexible tool for constructing toposes; we illustrate this by providing some general tools for creating toposes for Kreisel's modified realizability.</description>
