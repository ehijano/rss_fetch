      <title>Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coherent synchrotron radiation by excitation of surface plasmon polariton on near-critical solid microtube surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is vital for developing powerful ultrashort light sources. We introduce a CSR generation mechanism using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) resonantly excited on a solid, near-critical-density microtube. A high-intensity, circularly polarised laser pulse, propagating along the microtube axis, efficiently couples the cylindrical SPP modes. This process creates azimuthally structured, rotating electromagnetic fields. These rotating fields subsequently confine, modulate, and directly accelerate surface electrons, causing them to emit CSR in the Valilov-Cherenkov angle. We further demonstrate that by improving the azimuthal symmetry, the helical modulation enables CSR emission across all azimuthal directions, significantly enhancing radiation intensity even when full coherence is imperfect. The harmonics can be well isolated for a high charge beam. Our full 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate this scheme can generate X-rays with coherence enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to incoherent emission.</description>

      <title>Topological defect modes in bilayer acoustic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates topological properties of a material in the bulk to the presence of robust modes localized on the edge, is at the core of the now mature field of topological wave physics. More recently, it was realized that in crystalline structures, certain types of defects can host localized modes, in which case the bulk-boundary correspondence has to be replaced by a bulk-defect correspondence. These defect-localized modes are expected to have robust properties owing to their topological origin. In this work, we show how to obtain topological defect modes in a lattice possessing both mirror and chiral symmetry. The defect is obtained by endowing a plaquette with a non-trivial gauge flux. We show that the bulk-defect correspondence is satisfied by introducing appropriate topological invariants. Moreover, the topological defect modes are shown to be highly robust to the introduction of symmetry-preserving disorder. The model is then realized in an acoustic system made of a network of tubes, and the presence of topological defect mode is experimentally clearly demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Classical Fractons: Local chaos, global broken ergodicity and an arrow of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report new results on classical nonrelativistic dipole conserving particles - fractons. These have been previously shown to exhibit "Machian" dynamics where the motion of one particle requires the presence of others in its proximity, such that dynamics produces ergodicity breaking steady states characterized by clusters. In this work, we show that although the global state breaks ergodicity, a limited version of ergodic behavior is retained within the clusters which may or may not be chaotic, depending on the nature of the microscopic Hamiltonian. In certain cases, we show that the dynamics can be mapped to that of a billiards particle in various stadiums. We also show that the many-fracton trajectories characteristically exhibit a central time or "Janus point" and thus a generic nonequilibrium bidirectional arrow of time.</description>

      <title>The Frictional Brachistochrone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, I construct an elegant frictional brachistochrone for a mass point motion of a granular material with the Coulomb frictional energy dissipation that inherently includes the evolving path curvature. The simple model reveals several striking mechanical phenomena. It is applicable to any frictional particle. With increasing friction, the particle path becomes less and less curved until a straight brachistochrone is attained in the limit of sufficiently high friction. The existence of the straight-brachistochrone is phenomenal. Some potential industrial applications of the frictional brachistochrone are considered.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically accurate and geometric locking-free finite element implementation of a refined shell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate finite element analysis of refined shell theories is crucial but often hindered by membrane and shear locking effects. While various element-based locking-free techniques exist, this work addresses the problem at the theoretical level by utilizing results from asymptotic analysis. A formulation of a 2D refined shell theory incorporating transverse shear is developed using rescaled coordinates and angles of rotation, ensuring equal asymptotic orders of magnitude for extension, bending, and rotation measures and their respective stiffnesses. This novel approach, implemented via isogeometric analysis, is shown to be both asymptotically accurate relative to the underlying refined shell theory and inherently free from membrane and shear locking. Numerical simulations of semi-cylindrical shells show excellent agreement between the analytical solutions, 2D refined shell theory predictions, and 3D elasticity theory, validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed formulation.</description>
