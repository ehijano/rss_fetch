      <title>Low Degree Local Correction Over the Boolean Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07374v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the class of multivariate degree-$d$ polynomials mapping $\{0,1\}^{n}$ to any Abelian group $G$ is locally correctable with $\widetilde{O}_{d}((\log n)^{d})$ queries for up to a fraction of errors approaching half the minimum distance of the underlying code. In particular, this result holds even for polynomials over the reals or the rationals, special cases that were previously not known. Further, we show that they are locally list correctable up to a fraction of errors approaching the minimum distance of the code. These results build on and extend the prior work of the authors [ABPSS24] (STOC 2024) who considered the case of linear polynomials and gave analogous results.
  Low-degree polynomials over the Boolean cube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ arise naturally in Boolean circuit complexity and learning theory, and our work furthers the study of their coding-theoretic properties. Extending the results of [ABPSS24] from linear to higher-degree polynomials involves several new challenges and handling them gives us further insights into properties of low-degree polynomials over the Boolean cube. For local correction, we construct a set of points in the Boolean cube that lie between two exponentially close parallel hyperplanes and is moreover an interpolating set for degree-$d$ polynomials. To show that the class of degree-$d$ polynomials is list decodable up to the minimum distance, we stitch together results on anti-concentration of low-degree polynomials, the Sunflower lemma, and the Footprint bound for counting common zeroes of polynomials. Analyzing the local list corrector of [ABPSS24] for higher degree polynomials involves understanding random restrictions of non-zero degree-$d$ polynomials on a Hamming slice. In particular, we show that a simple random restriction process for reducing the dimension of the Boolean cube is a suitably good sampler for Hamming slices.</description>

      <title>Multiparty Communication Complexity of Collision Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an $\Omega(n^{1-1/k} \log k \ /2^k)$ lower bound on the $k$-party number-in-hand communication complexity of collision-finding. This implies a $2^{n^{1-o(1)}}$ lower bound on the size of tree-like cutting-planes proofs of the bit pigeonhole principle, a compact and natural propositional encoding of the pigeonhole principle, improving on the best previous lower bound of $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$.</description>

      <title>Nearly-Linear Time Seeded Extractors with Short Seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abstract shortened due to space constraints)
  Existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time $\Omega(n \log(1/\varepsilon))$ and often slower, where $n$ is the input source length and $\varepsilon$ is the error of the extractor. Since cryptographic applications of extractors require $\varepsilon$ to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors unusable in practice.
  Motivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time $O(n \log^c n)$, for any error $\varepsilon$. We show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields strong extractors for $n$-bit sources with any min-entropy $k$ and any target error $\varepsilon$ with seed length $d=O(\log(n/\varepsilon))$ and output length $m=(1-\eta)k$ for an arbitrarily small constant $\eta&gt;0$, running in nearly-linear time, after a reasonable one-time preprocessing step (finding a primitive element of $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q=poly(n/\varepsilon)$ a power of $2$) that is only required when $k&lt;2^{C\log^* n}\cdot\log^2(n/\varepsilon)$, for a constant $C&gt;0$ and $\log^*$ the iterated logarithm, and which can be implemented in time $polylog(n/\varepsilon)$ under mild conditions on $q$. As a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan's extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most $\frac{n}{\log(1/\varepsilon)polylog(n)}$. Previous fast implementations of Trevisan's extractor ran in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time in this setting. In particular, these extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with the same time complexity and output length, and communication complexity equal to their seed length.</description>

      <title>Feasibly Constructive Proof of Schwartz-Zippel Lemma and the Complexity of Finding Hitting Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwartz-Zippel Lemma states that if a low-degree multivariate polynomial with coefficients in a field is not zero everywhere in the field, then it has few roots on every finite subcube of the field. This fundamental fact about multivariate polynomials has found many applications in algorithms, complexity theory, coding theory, and combinatorics. We give a new proof of the lemma that offers some advantages over the standard proof.
  First, the new proof is more constructive than previously known proofs. For every given side-length of the cube, the proof constructs a polynomial-time computable and polynomial-time invertible surjection onto the set of roots in the cube. The domain of the surjection is tight, thus showing that the set of roots on the cube can be compressed. Second, the new proof can be formalised in Buss' bounded arithmetic theory $\mathrm{S}^1_2$ for polynomial-time reasoning. One consequence of this is that the theory $\mathrm{S}^1_2 + \mathrm{dWPHP(PV)}$ for approximate counting can prove that the problem of verifying polynomial identities (PIT) can be solved by polynomial-size circuits. The same theory can also prove the existence of small hitting sets for any explicitly described class of polynomials of polynomial degree.
  To complete the picture we show that the existence of such hitting sets is \emph{equivalent} to the surjective weak pigeonhole principle $\mathrm{dWPHP(PV)}$, over the theory $\mathrm{S}^1_2$. This is a contribution to a line of research studying the reverse mathematics of computational complexity. One consequence of this is that the problem of constructing small hitting sets for such classes is complete for the class APEPP of explicit construction problems whose totality follows from the probabilistic method. This class is also known and studied as the class of Range Avoidance Problems.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Knowledge PCP Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every polynomial q* there exist polynomial-size, constant-query, non-adaptive PCPs for NP which are perfect zero knowledge against (adaptive) adversaries making at most q* queries to the proof. In addition, we construct exponential-size constant-query PCPs for NEXP with perfect zero knowledge against any polynomial-time adversary. This improves upon both a recent construction of perfect zero-knowledge PCPs for #P (STOC 2024) and the seminal work of Kilian, Petrank and Tardos (STOC 1997).</description>

      <title>Barriers to Complexity-Theoretic Proofs that Achieving AGI Using Machine Learning is Intractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper (van Rooij et al. 2024) claims to have proved that achieving human-like intelligence using learning from data is intractable in a complexity-theoretic sense. We identify that the proof relies on an unjustified assumption about the distribution of (input, output) pairs to the system. We briefly discuss that assumption in the context of two fundamental barriers to repairing the proof: the need to precisely define ``human-like," and the need to account for the fact that a particular machine learning system will have particular inductive biases that are key to the analysis.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence Problem of E-Pattern Languages with Regular Constraints is Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. Regular constraints restrict valid substitutions of variables by associating with each variable a regular language representable by, e.g., finite automata. Pattern languages with regular constraints contain only words in which each variable is substituted according to a set of regular constraints. We consider the membership, inclusion, and equivalence problems for erasing and non-erasing pattern languages with regular constraints. Our main result shows that the erasing equivalence problem, one of the most prominent open problems in the realm of patterns, becomes undecidable if regular constraints are allowed in addition to variable equality.</description>

      <title>Circuit Complexity Bounds for RoPE-based Transformer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the express power of the Transformer architecture is critical to understanding its capacity limits and scaling law. Recent works provide the circuit complexity bounds to Transformer-like architecture. On the other hand, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has emerged as a crucial technique in modern large language models, offering superior performance in capturing positional information compared to traditional position embeddings, which shows great potential in application prospects, particularly for the long context scenario. Empirical evidence also suggests that $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architectures demonstrate greater generalization capabilities compared to conventional Transformer models. In this work, we establish a tighter circuit complexity bound for Transformers with $\mathsf{RoPE}$ attention. Our key contribution is that we show that unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision, $O(1)$ layers, hidden dimension $d \leq O(n)$ cannot solve the arithmetic problem or the Boolean formula value problem. This result significantly demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the expressivity of the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architecture, although it achieves giant empirical success. Our theoretical framework not only establishes tighter complexity bounds but also may instruct further work on the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck inequalities characterize converses to the polynomial method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A surprising 'converse to the polynomial method' of Aaronson et al. (CCC'16) shows that any bounded quadratic polynomial can be computed exactly in expectation by a 1-query algorithm up to a universal multiplicative factor related to the famous Grothendieck constant. Here we show that such a result does not generalize to quartic polynomials and 2-query algorithms, even when we allow for additive approximations. We also show that the additive approximation implied by their result is tight for bounded bilinear forms, which gives a new characterization of the Grothendieck constant in terms of 1-query quantum algorithms. Along the way we provide reformulations of the completely bounded norm of a form, and its dual norm.</description>

      <title>Systems of Discrete Differential Equations, Constructive Algebraicity of the Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study systems of $n \geq 1$, not necessarily linear, discrete differential equations (DDEs) of order $k \geq 1$ with one catalytic variable. We provide a constructive and elementary proof of algebraicity of the solutions of such equations. This part of the present article can be seen as a generalization of the pioneering work by Bousquet-M\'elou and Jehanne (2006) who settled down the case $n=1$. Moreover, we obtain effective bounds for the algebraicity degrees of the solutions and provide an algorithm for computing annihilating polynomials of the algebraic series. Finally, we carry out a first analysis in the direction of effectivity for solving systems of DDEs in view of practical applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following task: suppose an algorithm is given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ promised $(i)$ $|\psi\rangle$ is $\varepsilon_1$-close to a stabilizer state in fidelity or $(ii)$ $|\psi\rangle$ is $\varepsilon_2$-far from all stabilizer states, decide which is the case. We show that for every $\varepsilon_1&gt;0$ and $\varepsilon_2\leq \varepsilon_1^C$, there is a $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$-sample and $n\cdot \textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$-time algorithm that decides which is the case (where $C&gt;1$ is a universal constant). Our proof includes a new definition of Gowers norm for quantum states, an inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of quantum states and new bounds on stabilizer covering for structured subsets of Paulis using results in additive combinatorics.</description>
