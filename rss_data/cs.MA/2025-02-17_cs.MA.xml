      <title>Robust Event-Triggered Integrated Communication and Control with Graph Information Bottleneck Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated communication and control serves as a critical ingredient in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. However, partial observability limitations will impair collaboration effectiveness, and a potential solution is to establish consensus through well-calibrated latent variables obtained from neighboring agents. Nevertheless, the rigid transmission of less informative content can still result in redundant information exchanges. Therefore, we propose a Consensus-Driven Event-Based Graph Information Bottleneck (CDE-GIB) method, which integrates the communication graph and information flow through a GIB regularizer to extract more concise message representations while avoiding the high computational complexity of inner-loop operations. To further minimize the communication volume required for establishing consensus during interactions, we also develop a variable-threshold event-triggering mechanism. By simultaneously considering historical data and current observations, this mechanism capably evaluates the importance of information to determine whether an event should be triggered. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Improving Graph-based Explanation Methods for Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), developed by the graph learning community, have been adopted and shown to be highly effective in multi-robot and multi-agent learning. Inspired by this successful cross-pollination, we investigate and characterize the suitability of existing GNN explanation methods for explaining multi-agent coordination. We find that these methods have the potential to identify the most-influential communication channels that impact the team's behavior. Informed by our initial analyses, we propose an attention entropy regularization term that renders GAT-based policies more amenable to existing graph-based explainers. Intuitively, minimizing attention entropy incentivizes agents to limit their attention to the most influential or impactful agents, thereby easing the challenge faced by the explainer. We theoretically ground this intuition by showing that minimizing attention entropy increases the disparity between the explainer-generated subgraph and its complement. Evaluations across three tasks and three team sizes i) provides insights into the effectiveness of existing explainers, and ii) demonstrates that our proposed regularization consistently improves explanation quality without sacrificing task performance.</description>

      <title>A Multiagent Path Search Algorithm for Large-Scale Coalition Structure Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coalition structure generation (CSG), i.e. the problem of optimally partitioning a set of agents into coalitions to maximize social welfare, is a fundamental computational problem in multiagent systems. This problem is important for many applications where small run times are necessary, including transportation and disaster response. In this paper, we develop SALDAE, a multiagent path finding algorithm for CSG that operates on a graph of coalition structures. Our algorithm utilizes a variety of heuristics and strategies to perform the search and guide it. It is an anytime algorithm that can handle large problems with hundreds and thousands of agents. We show empirically on nine standard value distributions, including disaster response and electric vehicle allocation benchmarks, that our algorithm enables a rapid finding of high-quality solutions and compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve the Min-Max Mixed-Shelves Picker-Routing Problem via Hierarchical and Parallel Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mixed-Shelves Picker Routing Problem (MSPRP) is a fundamental challenge in warehouse logistics, where pickers must navigate a mixed-shelves environment to retrieve SKUs efficiently. Traditional heuristics and optimization-based approaches struggle with scalability, while recent machine learning methods often rely on sequential decision-making, leading to high solution latency and suboptimal agent coordination. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical and parallel decoding approach for solving the min-max variant of the MSPRP via multi-agent reinforcement learning. While our approach generates a joint distribution over agent actions, allowing for fast decoding and effective picker coordination, our method introduces a sequential action selection to avoid conflicts in the multi-dimensional action space. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both solution quality and inference speed, particularly for large-scale and out-of-distribution instances. Our code is publicly available at http://github.com/LTluttmann/marl4msprp.</description>

      <title>A Scoresheet for Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainability is important for the transparency of autonomous and intelligent systems and for helping to support the development of appropriate levels of trust. There has been considerable work on developing approaches for explaining systems and there are standards that specify requirements for transparency. However, there is a gap: the standards are too high-level and do not adequately specify requirements for explainability. This paper develops a scoresheet that can be used to specify explainability requirements or to assess the explainability aspects provided for particular applications. The scoresheet is developed by considering the requirements of a range of stakeholders and is applicable to Multiagent Systems as well as other AI technologies. We also provide guidance for how to use the scoresheet and illustrate its generality and usefulness by applying it to a range of applications.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multi-Agent Planning with Adaptive Skill Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite much progress in training distributed artificial intelligence (AI), building cooperative multi-agent systems with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in sample efficiency, interpretability, and transferability. Unlike traditional learning-based methods that require extensive interaction with the environment, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in zero-shot planning and complex reasoning. However, existing LLM-based approaches heavily rely on text-based observations and struggle with the non-Markovian nature of multi-agent interactions under partial observability. We present COMPASS, a novel multi-agent architecture that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with a dynamic skill library and structured communication for decentralized closed-loop decision-making. The skill library, bootstrapped from demonstrations, evolves via planner-guided tasks to enable adaptive strategies. COMPASS propagates entity information through multi-hop communication under partial observability. Evaluations on the improved StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMACv2) demonstrate COMPASS achieves up to 30\% higher win rates than state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in symmetric scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Strategy Representation for Imitation Learning in Multi-Agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The offline datasets for imitation learning (IL) in multi-agent games typically contain player trajectories exhibiting diverse strategies, which necessitate measures to prevent learning algorithms from acquiring undesirable behaviors. Learning representations for these trajectories is an effective approach to depicting the strategies employed by each demonstrator. However, existing learning strategies often require player identification or rely on strong assumptions, which are not appropriate for multi-agent games. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Strategy Representation for Imitation Learning (STRIL) framework, which (1) effectively learns strategy representations in multi-agent games, (2) estimates proposed indicators based on these representations, and (3) filters out sub-optimal data using the indicators. STRIL is a plug-in method that can be integrated into existing IL algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STRIL across competitive multi-agent scenarios, including Two-player Pong, Limit Texas Hold'em, and Connect Four. Our approach successfully acquires strategy representations and indicators, thereby identifying dominant trajectories and significantly enhancing existing IL performance across these environments.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Limited Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem setting in which multiple autonomous agents must cooperatively navigate and perform tasks in an unknown, communication-constrained environment. Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches assume synchronous communications and perform poorly in such environments. We propose AsynCoMARL, an asynchronous MARL approach that uses graph transformers to learn communication protocols from dynamic graphs. AsynCoMARL can accommodate infrequent and asynchronous communications between agents, with edges of the graph only forming when agents communicate with each other. We show that AsynCoMARL achieves similar success and collision rates as leading baselines, despite 26\% fewer messages being passed between agents.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Semi-Gradient Descent for Learning Mean Field Games with Population-Aware Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) model interactions in large-population multi-agent systems through population distributions. Traditional learning methods for MFGs are based on fixed-point iteration (FPI), where policy updates and induced population distributions are computed separately and sequentially. However, FPI-type methods may suffer from inefficiency and instability due to potential oscillations caused by this forward-backward procedure. In this work, we propose a novel perspective that treats the policy and population as a unified parameter controlling the game dynamics. By applying stochastic parameter approximation to this unified parameter, we develop SemiSGD, a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-type method, where an agent updates its policy and population estimates simultaneously and fully asynchronously. Building on this perspective, we further apply linear function approximation (LFA) to the unified parameter, resulting in the first population-aware LFA (PA-LFA) for learning MFGs on continuous state-action spaces. A comprehensive finite-time convergence analysis is provided for SemiSGD with PA-LFA, including its convergence to the equilibrium for linear MFGs -- a class of MFGs with a linear structure concerning the population -- under the standard contractivity condition, and to a neighborhood of the equilibrium under a more practical condition. We also characterize the approximation error for non-linear MFGs. We validate our theoretical findings with six experiments on three MFGs.</description>

      <title>Wolfpack Adversarial Attack for Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional robust methods in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) often struggle against coordinated adversarial attacks in cooperative scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose the Wolfpack Adversarial Attack framework, inspired by wolf hunting strategies, which targets an initial agent and its assisting agents to disrupt cooperation. Additionally, we introduce the Wolfpack-Adversarial Learning for MARL (WALL) framework, which trains robust MARL policies to defend against the proposed Wolfpack attack by fostering system-wide collaboration. Experimental results underscore the devastating impact of the Wolfpack attack and the significant robustness improvements achieved by WALL.</description>
