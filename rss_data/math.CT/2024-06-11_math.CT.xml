      <title>The Semantics of Effects: Centrality, Quantum Control and Reversible Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis revolves around an area of computer science called "semantics". We work with operational semantics, equational theories, and denotational semantics.
  The first contribution of this thesis is a study of the commutativity of effects through the prism of monads. Monads are the generalisation of algebraic structures such as monoids, which have a notion of centre: the centre of a monoid is made of elements which commute with all others. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a monad to have a centre. We also detail the semantics of a language with effects that carry information on which effects are central. Moreover, we provide a strong link between its equational theories and its denotational semantics.
  The second focus of the thesis is quantum computing, seen as a reversible effect. Physically permissible quantum operations are all reversible, except measurement; however, measurement can be deferred at the end of the computation, allowing us to focus on the reversible part first. We define a simply-typed reversible programming language performing quantum operations called "unitaries". A denotational semantics and an equational theory adapted to the language are presented, and we prove that the former is complete.
  Furthermore, we study recursion in reversible programming, providing adequate operational and denotational semantics to a Turing-complete, reversible, functional programming language. The denotational semantics uses the dcpo enrichment of rig join inverse categories. This mathematical account of higher-order reasoning on reversible computing does not directly generalise to its quantum counterpart. In the conclusion, we detail the limitations and possible future for higher-order quantum control through guarded recursion.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of topological stacks of categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note extends Quillen's Theorem A to a large class of categories internal to topological spaces. This allows us to show that under a mild condition a fully faithful and essentially surjective functor between such topological categories induces a homotopy equivalence of classifying spaces. It follows from this that we can associate a 2-functorial homotopy type to a wide class of topological stacks of categories, taking values in the 2-category of spaces, continuous maps and homotopy classes of homotopies of maps. This generalises work of Noohi and Ebert on the homotopy types of topological stacks of groupoids under the restriction to the site with numerable open covers.</description>

      <title>Relative elegance and cartesian cubes with one connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Quillen equivalence between the Kan-Quillen model structure and a model structure, derived from a cubical model of homotopy type theory, on the category of cartesian cubical sets with one connection. We thereby identify a second model structure which both constructively models homotopy type theory and presents infinity-groupoids, the first example being the equivariant cartesian model of Awodey-Cavallo-Coquand-Riehl-Sattler.</description>

      <title>Effectful Semantics in Bicategories: Strong, Commutative, and Concurrent Pseudomonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of strong and commutative monads in the 2-dimensional setting of bicategories. This provides a framework for the analysis of effects in many recent models which form bicategories and not categories, such as those based on profunctors, spans, or strategies over games.
  We then show how the 2-dimensional setting provides new insights into the semantics of concurrent functional programs. We introduce concurrent pseudomonads, which capture the fundamental weak interchange law connecting parallel composition and sequential composition. This notion brings to light an intermediate level, strictly between strength and commutativity, which is invisible in traditional categorical models. We illustrate the concept with the continuation pseudomonad in concurrent game semantics.
  In developing this theory, we take care to understand the coherence laws governing the structural 2-cells. We give many examples and prove a number of practical and foundational results.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Set-Theoretic Polygon Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17974v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polygon equations generalize the prominent pentagon equation in very much the same way as simplex equations generalize the famous Yang-Baxter equation. In particular, they appeared as ''cocycle equations'' in Street's category theory associated with oriented simplices. Whereas the $(N-1)$-simplex equation can be regarded as a realization of the higher Bruhat order $B(N,N-2)$, the $N$-gon equation is a realization of the higher Tamari order $T(N,N-2)$. The latter and its dual $\tilde T(N,N-2)$, associated with which is the dual $N$-gon equation, have been shown to arise as suborders of $B(N,N-2)$ via a ''three-color decomposition''. There are two different reductions of $T(N,N-2)$ and $\tilde T(N,N-2)$, to ${T(N-1,N-3)}$, respectively $\tilde T(N-1,N-3)$. In this work, we explore the corresponding reductions of (dual) polygon equations, which lead to relations between solutions of neighboring (dual) polygon equations. We also elaborate (dual) polygon equations in this respect explicitly up to the octagon equation.</description>
