      <title>Verifying Parameterized Networks Specified by Vertex-Replacement Graph Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the parametric reachability problem (PRP) for families of networks described by vertex-replacement (VR) graph grammars, where network nodes run replicas of finite-state processes that communicate via binary handshaking. We show that the PRP problem for VR grammars can be effectively reduced to the PRP problem for hyperedge-replacement (HR) grammars at the cost of introducing extra edges for routing messages. This transformation is motivated by the existence of several parametric verification techniques for families of networks specified by HR grammars, or similar inductive formalisms. Our reduction enables applying the verification techniques for HR systems to systems with dense architectures, such as user-specified cliques and multi-partite graphs.</description>

      <title>Productive Quantum Programming Needs Better Abstract Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective, accessible abstraction hierarchy has made using and programming computers possible for people across all disciplines. Establishing such a hierarchy for quantum programming is an outstanding challenge, especially due to a proliferation of different conventions and the rapid pace of innovation. One critical portion of the hierarchy is the abstract machine, the layer that separates a programmer's mental model of the hardware from its physical realization. Drawing on historical parallels in classical computing, we explain why having the "right" quantum abstract machine (QAM) is essential for making progress in the field and propose a novel framework for evaluating QAMs based on a set of desirable criteria. These criteria capture aspects of a QAM such as universality, compactness, expressiveness, and composability, which aid in the representation of quantum programs. By defining this framework we take steps toward defining an optimal QAM. We further apply our framework to survey the landscape of existing proposals, draw comparisons, and assess them based on our criteria. While these proposals share many common strengths, we find that each falls short of our ideal. Our framework and our findings set a direction for subsequent efforts to define a future QAM that is both straightforward to map to a variety of quantum computers, and provides a stable abstraction for quantum software development.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Offline Data with Conservatism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by proposing an algorithm for training control barrier functions from offline datasets. Our algorithm trains the filter to not only prevent the system from reaching unsafe states but also out-of-distribution ones, at which the filter would be unreliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety and out-of-distribution avoidance while minimally affecting task performance.</description>

      <title>A SCADE Model Verification Method Based on B-Model Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the limitations of SCADE models in expressing and verifying abstract specifications in safety-critical systems, this study proposes a formal verification framework based on the B-Method. By establishing a semantic equivalence transformation mechanism from SCADE models to B models, a hierarchical mapping rule set is constructed, covering type systems, control flow structures, and state machines. This effectively addresses key technical challenges such as loop-equivalent transformation proof for high-order operators and modeling of temporal logic storage structures. The proposed method innovatively leverages the abstraction capabilities of B-Method in set theory and first-order logic, overcoming the constraints of native verification tools of SCADE in complex specification descriptions. It successfully verifies abstract specifications that are difficult to model directly in SCADE. Experimental results show that the transformed B models achieve a higher defect detection rate and improved verification efficiency in the ProB verification environment compared to the native verifier of SCADE, significantly enhancing the formal verification capability of safety-critical systems. This study provides a cross-model verification paradigm for embedded control systems in avionics, rail transportation, and other domains, demonstrating substantial engineering application value.</description>

      <title>Linear Recurrence Sequence Automata and the Addition of Abstract Numeration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract numeration systems encode natural numbers using radix ordered words of an infinite regular language and linear recurrence sequences play a key role in their valuation. Sequence automata, which are deterministic finite automata with an additional linear recurrence sequence on each transition, are introduced to compute various $\mathbb{Z}$-rational non commutative formal series in abstract numeration systems. Under certain Pisot conditions on the recurrence sequences, the support of these series is regular. This property can be leveraged to derive various synchronized relations including a deterministic finite automaton that computes the addition relation of various Dumont-Thomas numeration systems and deterministic finite automata converting between various numeration systems. A practical implementation for Walnut is provided.</description>
