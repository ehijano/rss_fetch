      <title>Evaluation of the Bilinear Condensate of the Planar Thirring Model in the Strongly Coupled Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Thirring model is thought to have a strongly coupled critical point for a single flavour of fermion. We look at the calculation of the bilinear condensate in this critical region, and its characterisation via an equation of state. Since the computation is numerically challenging we investigate improved Dirac operators. We present findings on different methods of calculation using a rational hybrid Monte Carlo scheme, and calculations of the bilinear condensate, an equation of state, and the associated critical exponents. Overlap and domain wall Dirac operators, and variants therein are considered.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric QCD on the lattice: Fine-tuning and counterterms for the Yukawa and quartic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we determine the fine-tuning of parameters in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ Supersymmetric QCD, discretized on a Euclidean lattice. Our focus is on the renormalization of Yukawa (gluino-quark-squark interactions) and quartic (four-squark interactions) couplings. Given that SUSY is broken on the lattice, non-supersymmetric counterterms must be added to the discretized Lagrangian, with coefficients which must be appropriately fine-tuned in order to recover SUSY in the continuum limit. To deduce the renormalization factors and the coefficients of the counterterms, we compute the relevant three-point (for the Yukawa couplings) and four-point Green's functions (for the quartic couplings) perturbatively to one-loop and to the lowest order in lattice spacing. Both dimensional and lattice regularizations are used to implement the Modified Minimal Subtraction scheme. Our lattice formulation employs the Wilson discretization for gluino and quark fields, the Wilson gauge action for gluons, and naive discretization for squark fields. One main difficulty in this study lies in the fact that different components of squark fields mix among themselves at the quantum level. Consequently, for an appropriate fine-tuning of the couplings, these mixings must be taken into account in the renormalization conditions. All Green's functions and renormalization factors exhibit an explicit dependence on the number of colors, $N_c$, the number of flavors, $N_f$, and the gauge parameter, $\alpha$, which are left unspecified. This work follows previous investigations on SQCD and finalizes the one-loop fine-tuning of the SQCD action on the lattice, paving the way for numerical simulations of SQCD.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charmed hadrons in QGP from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nature of charm degrees of freedom near the chiral crossover based on lattice QCD calculations of the second and fourth-order cumulants of charm fluctuations, and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations. We show that below the chiral crossover temperature, $T_{pc}$, the thermodynamics of charm can be very well understood in terms of charmed hadrons. We present evidence that above $T_{pc}$, however, charm quark-like excitations emerge as new degrees of freedom contributing to the partial charm pressure. Nonetheless, up to temperatures as high as 175 MeV, charmed hadron-like excitations significantly contribute to the partial charm pressure.</description>

      <title>Impressions of Parton Distribution Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of these developments are sketched herein.</description>

      <title>Detecting spacelike vacuum entanglement at all distances and promoting negativity to a necessary and sufficient entanglement measure in many-body regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though known to be present, the accessibility of spacelike vacuum entanglement capable of being a fundamental resource for quantum information processing has remained in question at distances beyond the scale of vacuum fluctuations in massive fields. For a broad subclass of physical many-body mixed Gaussian states, including the free scalar field vacuum, the logarithmic negativity is here shown to be a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement and to be entirely accessible by pairs of single-mode detectors in the continuum. By deriving exact and optimal detection profiles, entanglement resources in the massive field are demonstrated to be available at all distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order calculation of the matching coefficients that link unpolarized flavor non-singlet parton distribution functions with lattice QCD computable correlation functions. By using this high-order result, we notice a reduction in theoretical uncertainties compared to relying solely on previously known lower-order matching coefficients. Furthermore, based on this result we have extracted the three-loop unpolarized flavor non-singlet splitting function, which is in agreement with the state-of-the-art result. Due to the simplicity of our method, it has the potential to advance the calculation of splitting functions to the desired four-loop order.</description>

      <title>Gauging staggered fermion shift symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Staggered fermion shift symmetries correspond to translations of the fermion field within the unit cell of a hypercubic lattice. They satisfy an algebra and in four Euclidean dimensions can be related to a discrete subgroup of an $SU(4)$ flavor symmetry which plays a crucial role in showing that staggered fermions lead to a theory of four degenerate Dirac fermions in the continuum limit. They are associated with the appearance of certain $Z_2$ valued global parameters. We propose a strategy to try to partially gauge these translation symmetries by allowing these parameters to vary locally in the lattice. To maintain invariance of the action requires the addition of $Z_2$ valued higher form lattice gauge fields. An analogous procedure can be carried out for reduced staggered fermions where the shifts correspond to a discrete subgroup of an $SO(4)$ flavor symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We present the expansion of stout smearing and the Wilson flow in lattice perturbation theory to order $g_0^3$, which is suitable for one-loop calculations. As the Wilson flow is generated by infinitesimal stout smearing steps, the results are related to each other by taking the appropriate limits. We show how to apply perturbative stout smearing or Wilson flow to the Feynman rules of any lattice fermion action and and illustrate them by calculating the self-energy of the clover-improved Wilson fermion.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional QCD at finite density and its 't Hooft-Veneziano limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact solution of one-dimensional lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential is reviewed for the gauge groups $G=Z(N),U(N),SU(N)$ for all values of $N$ and the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Calculated are the partition function, free energy, the Polyakov loop expectation values, baryon density, quark condensate, meson and baryon correlation functions. Detailed analysis of the exact solutions is done for $N=2,3$ with one and two fermion flavors. In the large $N_f$ limit we uncover the Roberge-Weiss phase transition and discuss its remnants at finite $N_f$. In the case of $N_f$ degenerate flavors we also calculate 1) the large $N$ limit, 2) the large $N_f$ limit and 3) the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit of all models. The critical behavior of the models in these limits is studied and the phase structure is described in details. A comparison of all limits with $U(3)$ and $SU(3)$ QCD is also performed. In order to achieve these results we explore several representations of the partition function of one-dimensional QCD obtained and described in the text.</description>

      <title>Spin exchange-enabled quantum simulator for large-scale non-Abelian gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central requirement for the faithful implementation of large-scale lattice gauge theories (LGTs) on quantum simulators is the protection of the underlying gauge symmetry. Recent advancements in the experimental realizations of large-scale LGTs have been impressive, albeit mostly restricted to Abelian gauge groups. Guided by this requirement for gauge protection, we propose an experimentally feasible approach to implement large-scale non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{U}(N)$ LGTs with dynamical matter in $d+1$D, enabled by two-body spin-exchange interactions realizing local emergent gauge-symmetry stabilizer terms. We present two concrete proposals for $2+1$D $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{U}(2)$ LGTs, including dynamical bosonic matter and induced plaquette terms, that can be readily implemented in current ultracold-molecule and next-generation ultracold-atom platforms. We provide numerical benchmarks showcasing experimentally accessible dynamics, and demonstrate the stability of the underlying non-Abelian gauge invariance. We develop a method to obtain the effective gauge-invariant model featuring the relevant magnetic plaquette and minimal gauge-matter coupling terms. Our approach paves the way towards near-term realizations of large-scale non-Abelian quantum link models in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow, dualities, and quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge theories induced by measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work [SciPost Phys. 14, 129 (2023)] has demonstrated that quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge theories (Wegner models including the toric code in a limit) in general dimensions can be achieved by local adaptive measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states with higher-form generalized global symmetries. The entanglement structure of the resource SPT state reflects the geometric structure of the gauge theory. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the anomaly inflow mechanism between the deconfining phase of the simulated gauge theory on the boundary and the SPT state in the bulk, by showing that the anomalous gauge variation of the boundary state obtained by bulk measurement matches that of the bulk theory. Moreover, we construct the resource state and the measurement pattern for the measurement-based quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory with a matter field (Fradkin-Shenker model), where a simple scheme to protect gauge invariance of the simulated state against errors is proposed. We further consider taking an overlap between the wave function of the resource state for lattice gauge theories and that of a parameterized product state, and we derive precise dualities between partition functions with insertion of defects corresponding to gauging higher-form global symmetries, as well as measurement-induced phases where states induced by a partial overlap possess different (symmetry-protected) topological orders. Measurement-assisted operators to dualize quantum Hamiltonians of lattice gauge theories and their non-invertibility are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous $\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions within baryonic systems beyond the up and down quark sector is pivotal for a comprehensive description of nuclear forces. This study explores the interactions involving hyperons, particularly the $\Lambda$ particle, within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT). By incorporating $\Lambda$ hyperons into the NLEFT framework, we extend our investigation into the $S = -1$ sector, allowing us to probe the third dimension of the nuclear chart. We calculate the $\Lambda$ separation energies ($B_{\Lambda}$) of hypernuclei up to the medium-mass region, providing valuable insights into hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon ($YNN$) interactions. Our calculations employ high-fidelity chiral interactions at N${}^3$LO for nucleons and extend it to $\Lambda$ hyperons with leading-order S-wave $YN$ interactions as well as $YNN$ forces constrained only by the $A=4,5$ systems. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the SU(3) symmetry breaking and establish a foundation for future improvements in hypernuclear calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several LQCD simulations have proven that the interaction in the isoscalar channel in $DD^*$ scattering is attractive. This channel is naturally connected to the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ which is observed in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution. However, it remains an open question whether the virtual bound state found in the several LQCD simulations is actually linked to the LHCb experimental observation. In this article we perform an EFT-based analysis of the LQCD data and demostrate that a proper chiral extrapolation leads to a $T_{cc}$ pole compatible with experiment. At the physical pion mass, we find a virtual bound state with a binding energy $\Delta E=-0.06 \left(^{+1.30}_{-2.20}\right) \left(^{+0.50}_{-1.11}\right)$. Moreover, we extract from a global analysis both, the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}$ pole, and study the role of the $\rho$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>
