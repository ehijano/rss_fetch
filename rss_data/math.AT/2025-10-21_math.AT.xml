      <title>Strong formality of toric and homogeneous compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All compact K\"ahler, or even $\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds, are rationally formal. Not all of them are strongly formal. Yet some of them are: For complete smooth complex toric varieties and homogeneous compact K\"ahler manifolds we show the stronger property that they are both rationally and strongly formal in a compatible way.</description>

      <title>Non-realizability of a triple Massey product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an often used example of a cohomology algebra with non-vanishing triple Massey product is intrinsically A_3-formal and therefore, in fact, cannot be realized as the cohomology of a differential graded algebra with non-vanishing triple Massey product. We prove this result by computing the graded Hochschild cohomology group which contains the potential obstruction to the vanishing.</description>

      <title>Embedding groups into acyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that labelled Thompson groups and twisted Brin--Thompson groups are all acyclic. This allows us to prove several new embedding results for groups. First, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically as a subgroup of an acyclic group of type $F_n$ that has no proper finite-index subgroups. This improves results of Baumslag--Dyer--Heller ($n=1$) and Baumslag--Dyer--Miller ($n=2$) from the early 80s, as well as a more recent result of Bridson ($n=2$). Second, we show that every finitely generated group embeds quasi-isometrically as a subgroup of a $2$-generated, simple, acyclic group. Our results also allow us to produce, for each $n\geqslant 2$, the first known example of an acyclic group that is of type $F_n$ but not $F_{n+1}$. These examples can moreover be taken to be simple. Furthermore, our examples provide a rich source of universally boundedly acyclic groups.</description>

      <title>Affineness and reconstruction in higher Zariski geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how the geometric framework introduced in arXiv:2508.11621 [math.AG] provides a universal property for the 2-rings of perfect complexes on qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral schemes. As an application, given a qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral scheme $X$ this produces a comparison morphism from $\operatorname{Spec} \mathrm{Perf}_{X}$ to $X$ itself, which is moreover natural in $X$. When $X$ is an ordinary qcqs scheme, this construction supplies a new proof of the Balmer-Thomason reconstruction of $X$ from its space of thick subcategories, assuming the result for noetherian rings due to Neeman. As another application, we find spectral and Dirac spectral enhancements of support varieties arising for 2-rings in representation theory which "geometrize" the 2-rings that produce them. For example, given a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, this produces a "spectral support variety" $\mathcal{V}_{G}$ such that $\mathrm{Perf}_{\mathcal{V}_{G}}$ maps into the stable module category of $kG$. We derive these results as a corollary of a general affineness criterion for 2-schemes which are covered by the Zariski spectra of rigid 2-rings: this states that such 2-schemes are affine if and only if they are quasicompact and quasiseparated.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the category of localizing motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the category of localizing motives $\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}$ -- the target of the universal finitary localizing invariant of idempotent-complete stable categories as defined by Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada. We prove that this (presentable stable) category is rigid symmetric monoidal in the sense of Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum. In particular, it is dualizable. More precisely, we prove a more general version of this result for the category $\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ -- the target of the universal finitary localizing invariant of dualizable modules over a rigid symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{E}.$
  We obtain general results on morphisms and internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in the categories $\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ of localizing motives. As an application we compute the morphisms in multiple non-trivial examples. In particular, we prove the corepresentability statements for $\operatorname{TR}$ (topological restriction) and $\operatorname{TC}$ (topological cyclic homology) when restricted to connective $\mathbb{E}_1$-rings. As a corollary, for a connective $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-ring $R$ we obtain a $\operatorname{TR}(R)$-module structure on the nil $K$-theory spectrum $NK(R).$
  We also apply the rigidity theorem to define refined versions of negative cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology. This was announced previously in \cite{E24b}, and certain very interesting examples were computed by Meyer and Wagner in \cite{MW24}. Here we do several computations in characteristic $0,$ in particular showing that in seemingly innocuous situations the answer can be given by an interesting algebra of overconvergent functions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of motives with rational coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rational motives over an arbitrary base scheme $S$ and identify a natural, necessary and sufficient criterion guaranteeing that the principal models of rational motives agree. Starting from the free $\mathbb{Q}$-linearization $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]$ of the motivic sphere spectrum and from the motivic rational Eilenberg MacLane spectrum $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ built from rational finite correspondences, we analyse the canonical ring map $\Phi_S:\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]\to\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$. Our main result shows that $\Phi_S$ is a stable motivic equivalence as soon as motivic cohomology groups computed in Ayoub's framework agree, for all smooth $S$-schemes $X$ of finite type and all bidegrees, with those computed in Voevodsky's (Nisnevich) theory. From this identification of stable homotopy sheaves we deduce several consequences: for every excellent geometrically unibranch base the map $\Phi_S$ is an equivalence; modules over $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]$ recover the usual Beilinson/Ayoub/Morel incarnations of rational motives; and under the hypothesis that $\Phi_-$ is an equivalence formation of $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ commutes with base change.</description>

      <title>Variations on cohomology rings and zero schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theorem of Hausel and the author from arXiv:2212.11836 that relates equivariant cohomology rings and algebras of functions on zero schemes. This paper combines three separate results. We prove that for a reductive group G acting on a smooth projective variety one can see the equivariant cohomology ring as the ring of functions on the zero scheme over the Kostant section, provided that some transversality condition is satisfied. In particular, we show that the conclusion holds for spherical varieties. We then show a version for singular varieties, e.g. discriminant varieties, where in general we only recover a part of equivariant cohomology ring, generated by Chern classes. We also show that an analogous result, connecting equivariant K-theory to the ring of functions on the fixed-point scheme, holds for GKM spaces.
  This is a concise version of some results from the PhD thesis arXiv:2407.14659, which contains a broader introduction to the topic.</description>

      <title>Interactions between Coarse Homotopy and Ends on Proper Geodesic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the coarse-geometric notion of ends in the context of coarse homotopy. We show that, when recontextualized as a functor from an appropriate coarse category of proper geodesic spaces, the set of ends $\mathcal{E}\text{nds}(-)$ is a coarse homotopy invariant. Further, we prove the existence of a natural surjection from the coarse path component functor $\pi_0^{\text{Crs}}(-)$ to $\mathcal{E}\text{nds}(-)$, and show that in general, this is not an injection (even when restricted to locally finite planar graphs). Finally, we begin to consider when this injection indeed exists by showing that this is the case for locally finite geometric trees, providing a number of useful preliminary lemmas on the behaviour of geodesics in this context.</description>

      <title>Square-section braid groups and Higman-Neumann-Neumann extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For positive integers $n$, $p$ and $q$ with $pq-n&gt;0$, let $UC(n,p\times q)$ denote the configuration space of $n$ unlabelled hard unit squares in the rectangle $[0,p]\times[0,q]$, and let $B_n(p\times q)$ denote the corresponding fundamental group. It is known that, as $pq-n$ becomes large, $UC(n,p\times q)$ starts capturing homotopical properties of the classical configuration space of $n$ unlabelled pairwise-distinct points in the plane. At the start of this approximation process, $UC(pq-1,p\times q)$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of $(p-1)(q-1)$ circles, while the only other general families of spaces $UC(n,p\times q)$ known to be aspherical are $UC(n,p\times2)$ for $p\geq n$, and $UC(pq-2,p\times q)$. The fundamental groups of the former family are known to be responsible for the ``right-angled'' relations in Artin's classical braid groups. We prove that the fundamental groups of the latter family have a minimal presentation all whose relators are commutators. In particular, after explaining how $B_{2p-2}(p\times2)$ arises as the right-angled Artin group (RAAG) associated to a certain meta-edge, we show that $B_{3p-2}(p\times3)$ is a Higman-Neumann-Neumann extension of the RAAG associated to the corresponding meta-square. We provide a geometric interpretation of the latter fact in terms of Salvetti complexes.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Topologies and Sheaf Theory for Data and Graphs: An Approach Through Cech Closure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of sheaves on Cech closure spaces, providing a new, unified approach to sheaf theory on many of the major classes of spaces of interest to applications: topological spaces, finite simplicial complexes (seen as $T_0$ topological spaces), graphs and digraphs (both seen as closure spaces), quivers (seen as a pair of closure spaces), and metric spaces decorated with a privileged scale, the latter of which are widely used in topological data analysis. Our construction proceeds by constructing a Grothendieck topology on the category $\mathcal{M}_{c_X}$ of finite intersections of subspaces of $(X,c_X)$ with non-empty $c_X$-interior, which is the natural generalization to closure spaces of the category $\mathcal{O}(X,\tau)$ of open sets in a topological space. We continue by constructing the sheaf and Cech cohomologies on $\mathcal{M}_{c_X}$, and we then identify examples of non-topological closure spaces induced by graphs with non-trivial sheaf cohomology, in particular in dimension two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an algebraic model for the Chas-Sullivan product and the Goresky-Hingston coproduct in string topology. The construction takes as its initial input a simplicial complex equipped with a local pairing on its simplicial chains, for instance, a homology manifold with its local intersection pairing. We define the two string topology operations on the coHochschild complex of a suitable coalgebra of chains, making use of local higher homotopies that control the compatibility of the pairing with the diagonal approximation coproduct. In the case of a closed oriented smooth manifold, we prove that our algebraic operations coincide, up to chain homotopy, with their geometric counterparts. The local nature of our constructions allows for arguments based on the method of acyclic models.</description>

      <title>Embedding calculus and Vassiliev spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vassiliev spectral sequence and Sinha spectral sequence are both related to cohomology of the space of long knots $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^3$. Although they have different origins, the Vassiliev $E_1$-page and the Sinha $E_2$-page are isomorphic (up to a degree shift). In this paper, we prove that they have isomorphic $E_\infty$-pages if the coefficient ring is a field. Together with degeneracy of the Sinha sequence, this implies that the Vassiliev sequence degenerates at $E_1$-page over $\mathbb{Q}$ including the non-diagonal part. Our result also implies that for any coefficient field, the space of finite type $n$ knot invariants is isomorphic to the space of weight systems of weight $\leq n$ if and only if the parts of the Sinha sequence of bidegree $(-i,i)$ degenerate at $E_2$ for $i\leq 2n$. For the construction of the isomorphism, we use a variant of Thom space model which was introduced in the author's previous paper and captures embedding calculus of the knot space in terms of fat diagonals. As a byproduct of the construction, we give a partial computation on differentials of unstable versions of the Vassiliev sequence which converge to finite dimensional approximations of the knot space.</description>

      <title>A motivic filtration on the topological cyclic homology of commutative ring spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a prime number $p$ and a $p$-quasisyntomic commutative ring $R$, Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze defined motivic filtrations on the $p$-completions of $\mathrm{THH}(R), \mathrm{TC}^{-}(R), \mathrm{TP}(R),$ and $\mathrm{TC}(R)$, with the associated graded objects for $\mathrm{TP}(R)$ and $\mathrm{TC}(R)$ recovering the prismatic and syntomic cohomology of $R$, respectively. We give an alternate construction of these filtrations that applies also when $R$ is a well-behaved commutative ring spectrum; for example, we can take $R$ to be $\mathbb{S}$, $\mathrm{MU}$, $\mathrm{ku}$, $\mathrm{ko}$, or $\mathrm{tmf}$. We compute the mod $(p,v_1)$ syntomic cohomology of the Adams summand $\ell$ and observe that, when $p \ge 3$, the motivic spectral sequence for $V(1)_*\mathrm{TC}(\ell)$ collapses at the $\mathrm{E}_2$-page.</description>

      <title>Notes on Milnor-Witt K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes develop the foundations of Milnor-Witt K-theory for fields of arbitrary characteristic, without any perfectness assumptions. Extending the work of Morel and Feld, we establish all functorial properties of Milnor-Witt K-theory with careful attention to twists. A main new contribution is the computation of transfers in the general, in particular inseparable, case using Grothendieck (differential) trace maps. The results provide a complete framework for the functoriality axioms of Milnor-Witt modules and form the basis for an upcoming work on Chow-Witt groups with Niels Feld and Fangzhou Jin.</description>

      <title>Spectral weight filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a description of Voevodsky's $\infty$-category of motivic spectra in terms of the subcategory of motives of smooth proper varieties. As applications, we construct weight filtrations on the Betti and \'{e}tale cohomologies of algebraic varieties with coefficients in any complex oriented ring spectrum. We show that these filtrations satisfy $\ell\mathrm{dh}$-descent, giving an effective way of calculating them in positive characteristic. In the complex motivic case, we further refine the weight filtration to one defined at the level of stable homotopy types.</description>

      <title>Stolz positive scalar curvature structure groups, proper actions and equivariant 2-types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study equivariant versions of Stolz' R-groups, the positive scalar curvature structure groups $R_n(X)^G$, for proper actions of discrete groups $G$. We define the concept of a fundamental groupoid functor for a $G$-space, encapsulating all the fundamental group information of all the fixed point sets and their relations. We construct classifying spaces for fundamental groupoid functors. As a geometric result, we show that Stolz' equivariant R-group $R_n(X)^G$ depends only on the fundamental groupoid functor of the reference space $X$. The proof covers at the same time in a concise and clear way the classical non-equivariant case.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</description>
