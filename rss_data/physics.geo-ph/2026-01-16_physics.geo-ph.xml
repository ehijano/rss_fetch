      <title>Model-Driven GPR Inversion Network With Surrogate Forward Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven deep learning is considered a promising solution for ground-penetrating radar (GPR) full-waveform inversion (FWI), while its generalization ability is limited due to the heavy reliance on abundant labeled samples. In contrast, Deep unfolding network (DUN) usually exhibits better generalization by integrating model-driven and data-driven approaches, yet its application to GPR FWI remains challenging due to the high computational cost associated with forward simulations. In this paper, we integrate a deep learning-based (DL-based) forward solver within an unfolding framework to form a fully neural-network-based architecture, UA-Net, for GPR FWI. The forward solver rapidly predicts B-scans given permittivity and conductivity models and enables automatic differentiation to compute gradients for inversion. In the inversion stage, an optimization process based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is unfolded into a multi-stage network with three interconnected modules: data fitting, regularization, and multiplier update. Specifically, the regularization module is trained end-to-end for adaptive learning of sparse target features. Experimental results demonstrate that UA-Net outperforms classical FWI and data-driven methods in reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, by employing transfer learning to fine-tune the network, UA-Net can be effectively applied to field data and produce reliable results.</description>

      <title>Joint Bayesian inference of Earth's magnetic field and core surface flow on millennial timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding Earth's core dynamics over millennial timescales requires models that jointly describe the evolution of the geomagnetic field and core surface flow, while accommodating the sparse, irregular, and uncertain nature of archaeomagnetic and palaeomagnetic data. We present a new Bayesian core field and core flow modelling framework that utilises archaeo/palaeomagnetic data directly, combining a reduced stochastic representation of core surface dynamics derived from numerical geodynamo statistics with a probabilistic treatment of observational and chronological uncertainties. A key innovation is an efficient discrete marginalisation of age uncertainties, which avoids the convergence difficulties associated with co-estimating ages in high-dimensional Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inversions. The framework aims to reconstruct the coupled evolution of the geomagnetic field and core surface flow over the past 9000 years while preserving dynamical correlations implied by the prior geodynamo time series. Tests using synthetic data generated from an Earth-like geodynamo demonstrate that the method reliably recovers large-scale geomagnetic field variations and key aspects of core dynamics, including long-term westward drift and the evolution of planetary-scale eccentric gyres. These results show that, when combined with physically informed priors, archaeo/palaeomagnetic data can constrain millennial-scale core flow, paving the way for reconstructions based on real data.</description>

      <title>Entropic Approach to Critical Materials Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most methodologies for materials criticality assessment score supply risk and societal importance. Market-based criteria offer quantitative measures for assessment. Here we develop a statistical approach based on a geologic entropy function in which flexible constraints, such as economic, national security related, or regulatory, can be applied. As an example, the formulation describes the relation between elemental price and crustal abundance for selected elements, both important to supply risk. The method may be applicable to parameters resulting from collective decisions exhibiting a highly peaked probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Reversible grain boundary complexion transition explains cratonic lithosphere anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.</description>

      <title>Detection of Earth's free oscillations utilizing TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of Earth's free oscillations plays an important role in studying the Earth's large-scale structure. Space technology development presents a potential method to observe these normal modes by measuring inter-satellite distances. However, the disturbance from the Earth's low-degree gravity field makes it challenging for low Earth orbit gravity measurement satellites such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and TianQin-2 to extract signals from Earth's free oscillations directly. Here, we propose that by taking advantage of the high Earth orbit, the TianQin satellites can effectively avoid this disturbance, enabling direct measurement of Earth's free oscillations. We derive an analytical waveform to describe the response of Earth's free oscillations in TianQin. Based on this waveform, we use Bayesian analysis to extract the normal modes from numerical simulation data and perform parameter estimation. Our findings reveal that for a magnitude 7.9, Wenchuan-like earthquake, the resulting free oscillations will generate a signal that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 73 in TianQin, and approximately 9 different modes can be distinguished. This result shows TianQin can open a new window to examine the Earth's free oscillations and study the Earth's interior and earthquakes independently from ground-based gravity measurement.</description>
