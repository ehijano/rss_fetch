      <title>Hierarchical Conditioning of Diffusion Models Using Tree-of-Life for Studying Species Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in biology is to understand how organisms evolve and adapt to their environment by acquiring variations in the observable characteristics or traits of species across the tree of life. With the growing availability of large-scale image repositories in biology and recent advances in generative modeling, there is an opportunity to accelerate the discovery of evolutionary traits automatically from images. Toward this goal, we introduce Phylo-Diffusion, a novel framework for conditioning diffusion models with phylogenetic knowledge represented in the form of HIERarchical Embeddings (HIER-Embeds). We also propose two new experiments for perturbing the embedding space of Phylo-Diffusion: trait masking and trait swapping, inspired by counterpart experiments of gene knockout and gene editing/swapping. Our work represents a novel methodological advance in generative modeling to structure the embedding space of diffusion models using tree-based knowledge. Our work also opens a new chapter of research in evolutionary biology by using generative models to visualize evolutionary changes directly from images. We empirically demonstrate the usefulness of Phylo-Diffusion in capturing meaningful trait variations for fishes and birds, revealing novel insights about the biological mechanisms of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Within-vector viral dynamics challenges how to model the extrinsic incubation period for major arboviruses: dengue, Zika, and chikungunya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arboviruses represent a significant threat to human, animal, and plant health worldwide. To elucidate transmission, anticipate their spread and efficiently control them, mechanistic modelling has proven its usefulness. However, most models rely on assumptions about how the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) is represented: the intra-vector viral dynamics (IVD), occurring during the EIP, is approximated by a single state. After an average duration, all exposed vectors become infectious. Behind this are hidden two strong hypotheses: (i) EIP is exponentially distributed in the vector population; (ii) viruses successfully cross the infection, dissemination, and transmission barriers in all exposed vectors. To assess these hypotheses, we developed a stochastic compartmental model which represents successive IVD stages, associated to the crossing or not of these three barriers. We calibrated the model using an ABC-SMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo) method with model selection. We systematically searched for literature data on experimental infections of Aedes mosquitoes infected by either dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses. We demonstrated the discrepancy between the exponential hypothesis and observed EIP distributions for dengue and Zika viruses and identified more relevant EIP distributions . We also quantified the fraction of infected mosquitoes eventually becoming infectious, highlighting that often only a small fraction crosses the three barriers. This work provides a generic modelling framework applicable to other arboviruses for which similar data are available. Our model can also be coupled to population-scale models to aid future arbovirus control.</description>

      <title>Impact of opinion dynamics on recurrent pandemic waves: balancing risk aversion and peer pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent waves which are often observed during long pandemics typically form as a result of several interrelated dynamics including public health interventions, population mobility and behaviour, varying disease transmissibility due to pathogen mutations, and changes in host immunity due to recency of vaccination or previous infections. Complex nonlinear dependencies among these dynamics, including feedback between disease incidence and the opinion-driven adoption of social distancing behaviour, remain poorly understood, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous population, partial and waning immunity, and rapidly changing public opinions. This study addressed this challenge by proposing an opinion dynamics model that accounts for changes in social distancing behaviour (i.e., whether to adopt social distancing) by modelling both individual risk perception and peer pressure. The opinion dynamics model was integrated and validated within a large-scale agent-based COVID-19 pandemic simulation that modelled the spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 between December 2021 and June 2022 in Australia. Our study revealed that the fluctuating adoption of social distancing, shaped by individual risk aversion and social peer pressure from both household and workplace environments, may explain the observed pattern of recurrent waves of infections.</description>

      <title>Force and kinetics of fast and slow muscle myosin determined with a synthetic sarcomere-like nanomachine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myosin II is the muscle molecular motor that works in two bipolar arrays in each thick filament of the striated (skeletal and cardiac) muscle, converting the chemical energy into steady force and shortening by cyclic ATP--driven interactions with the nearby actin filaments. Different isoforms of the myosin motor in the skeletal muscles account for the different functional requirements of the slow muscles (primarily responsible for the posture) and fast muscles (responsible for voluntary movements). To clarify the molecular basis of the differences, here the isoform--dependent mechanokinetic parameters underpinning the force of slow and fast muscles are defined with a unidimensional synthetic nanomachine powered by pure myosin isoforms from either slow or fast rabbit skeletal muscle. Data fitting with a stochastic model provides a self--consistent estimate of all the mechanokinetic properties of the motor ensemble including the motor force, the fraction of actin--attached motors and the rate of transition through the attachment--detachment cycle. The achievements in this paper set the stage for any future study on the emergent mechanokinetic properties of an ensemble of myosin molecules either engineered or purified from mutant animal models or human biopsies.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model for Co-infection Dynamics of Pneumocystis Pneumonia and HIV/AIDS with Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of opportunistic infections among HIV infected individuals should be one of the major public health concerns in reducing mortality rate of individuals living with HIV/AIDS. In this study a deterministic co-infection mathematical model is employed to provide a quantification of treatment at each contagious stage against Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV infected individuals on ART. The disease-free equilibrium for the HIV/AIDS sub model, PCP sub model and the co-infection model are shown to be locally asymptotically stable when their associated disease threshold parameter is less than a unity. By use of suitable Lyapunov functions, the endemic equilibrium corresponding to HIV/AIDS and PCP sub models are globally asymptotically stable whenever $\mathcal{R}_{0H}&gt;1$ and $\mathcal{R}_{0P}&gt;1$ respectively. The sensitivity analysis results implicate that the effective contact rates are the main mechanisms fueling the proliferation of the two diseases and on the other hand treatment efforts play an important role in reducing the incidence. Numerical simulations show that treatment of PCP at all contagious stages reduces its burden on HIV/AIDS patients and dual treatment of the co-infected individuals significantly reduces the burden of the co-infection.</description>
