      <title>An Update to the SBML Human-Readable Antimony Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimony is a high-level, human-readable text-based language designed for defining and sharing models in the systems biology community. It enables scientists to describe biochemical networks and systems using a simple and intuitive syntax. It allows users to easily create, modify, and distribute reproducible computational models. By allowing the concise representation of complex biological processes, Antimony enhances collaborative efforts, improves reproducibility, and accelerates the iterative development of models in systems biology. This paper provides an update to the Antimony language since it was introduced in 2009. In particular, we highlight new annotation features, support for flux balance analysis, a new rateOf method, support for probability distributions and uncertainty, named stochiometries, and algebraic rules. Antimony is also now distributed as a C/C++ library, together with python and Julia bindings, as well as a JavaScript version for use within a web browser.

      <title>Knowledge-enhanced Relation Graph and Task Sampling for Few-shot Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP) has garnered increasing attention. Despite impressive breakthroughs achieved by existing methods, they often overlook the inherent many-to-many relationships between molecules and properties, which limits their performance. For instance, similar substructures of molecules can inspire the exploration of new compounds. Additionally, the relationships between properties can be quantified, with high-related properties providing more information in exploring the target property than those low-related. To this end, this paper proposes a novel meta-learning FSMPP framework (KRGTS), which comprises the Knowledge-enhanced Relation Graph module and the Task Sampling module. The knowledge-enhanced relation graph module constructs the molecule-property multi-relation graph (MPMRG) to capture the many-to-many relationships between molecules and properties. The task sampling module includes a meta-training task sampler and an auxiliary task sampler, responsible for scheduling the meta-training process and sampling high-related auxiliary tasks, respectively, thereby achieving efficient meta-knowledge learning and reducing noise introduction. Empirically, extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the superiority of KRGTS over a variety of state-of-the-art methods. The code is available in https://github.com/Vencent-Won/KRGTS-public.</description>

      <title>NMGrad: Advancing Histopathological Bladder Cancer Grading with Weakly Supervised Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most prevalent form of bladder cancer is urothelial carcinoma, characterized by a high recurrence rate and substantial lifetime treatment costs for patients. Grading is a prime factor for patient risk stratification, although it suffers from inconsistencies and variations among pathologists. Moreover, absence of annotations in medical imaging difficults training deep learning models. To address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline designed for bladder cancer grading using histological slides. First, it extracts urothelium tissue tiles at different magnification levels, employing a convolutional neural network for processing for feature extraction. Then, it engages in the slide-level prediction process. It employs a nested multiple instance learning approach with attention to predict the grade. To distinguish different levels of malignancy within specific regions of the slide, we include the origins of the tiles in our analysis. The attention scores at region level is shown to correlate with verified high-grade regions, giving some explainability to the model. Clinical evaluations demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>realSEUDO for real-time calcium imaging analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop neuroscience experimentation, where recorded neural activity is used to modify the experiment on-the-fly, is critical for deducing causal connections and optimizing experimental time. A critical step in creating a closed-loop experiment is real-time inference of neural activity from streaming recordings. One challenging modality for real-time processing is multi-photon calcium imaging (CI). CI enables the recording of activity in large populations of neurons however, often requires batch processing of the video data to extract single-neuron activity from the fluorescence videos. We use the recently proposed robust time-trace estimator-Sparse Emulation of Unused Dictionary Objects (SEUDO) algorithm-as a basis for a new on-line processing algorithm that simultaneously identifies neurons in the fluorescence video and infers their time traces in a way that is robust to as-yet unidentified neurons. To achieve real-time SEUDO (realSEUDO), we optimize the core estimator via both algorithmic improvements and an fast C-based implementation, and create a new cell finding loop to enable realSEUDO to also identify new cells. We demonstrate comparable performance to offline algorithms (e.g., CNMF), and improved performance over the current on-line approach (OnACID) at speeds of 120 Hz on average.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport for automatic alignment of untargeted metabolomic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Untargeted metabolomic profiling through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measures a vast array of metabolites within biospecimens, advancing drug development, disease diagnosis, and risk prediction. However, the low throughput of LC-MS poses a major challenge for biomarker discovery, annotation, and experimental comparison, necessitating the merging of multiple datasets. Current data pooling methods encounter practical limitations due to their vulnerability to data variations and hyperparameter dependence. Here we introduce GromovMatcher, a flexible and user-friendly algorithm that automatically combines LC-MS datasets using optimal transport. By capitalizing on feature intensity correlation structures, GromovMatcher delivers superior alignment accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches. This algorithm scales to thousands of features requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. Manually curated datasets for validating alignment algorithms are limited in the field of untargeted metabolomics, and hence we develop a dataset split procedure to generate pairs of validation datasets to test the alignments produced by GromovMatcher and other methods. Applying our method to experimental patient studies of liver and pancreatic cancer, we discover shared metabolic features related to patient alcohol intake, demonstrating how GromovMatcher facilitates the search for biomarkers associated with lifestyle risk factors linked to several cancer types.</description>
