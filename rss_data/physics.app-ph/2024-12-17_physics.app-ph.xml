      <title>Vertically Integrated Dual-memtransistor Enabled Reconfigurable Heterosynaptic Sensorimotor Networks and In-memory Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic in-memory computing requires area-efficient architecture for seamless and low latency parallel processing of large volumes of data. Here, we report a compact, vertically integrated/stratified field-effect transistor (VSFET) consisting of a 2D non-ferroelectric MoS$_2$ FET channel stacked on a 2D ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ FET channel. Electrostatic coupling between the ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric semiconducting channels results in hysteretic transfer and output characteristics of both FETs. The gate-controlled MoS$_2$ memtransistor is shown to emulate homosynaptic plasticity behavior with low nonlinearity, low epoch, and high accuracy supervised (ANN - artificial neural network) and unsupervised (SNN - spiking neural network) on-chip learning. Further, simultaneous measurements of the MoS$_2$ and In$_2$Se$_3$ transistor synapses help realize complex heterosynaptic cooperation and competition behaviors. These are shown to mimic advanced sensorimotor neural network-controlled gill withdrawal reflex sensitization and habituation of a sea mollusk (Aplysia) with ultra-low power consumption. Finally, we show logic reconfigurability of the VSFET to realize Boolean gates thereby adding significant design flexibility for advanced computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Non-locality detection in nano-semiconductors based on lagging models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin film ferroelectric devices with ultralow power operation, non-volatile data retention and fast and reliable switching are attractive for non-volatile memory and as synaptic weight elements. However, low thermal budget ferroelectric oxides suffer from crystalline inhomogeneity and defects that makes their large-scale circuit integration challenging. Here, we report on the thermally engineered way to induce wafer-scale homogeneity in Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ capacitors that can lead to high device reliability making their integration possible in ultralow power memory and neuromorphic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>A magneto-ionic synapse for reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to revolutionize large-scale data processing by developing efficient methods and devices inspired by neural networks. Among these, the control of magnetism through ion migration has emerged as a promising approach due to the inherent memory and nonlinearity of ionically conducting and magnetic materials. In this work, we present a lithium-ion-based magneto-ionic device that uses applied voltages to control the magnetic domain state of a perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic layer. This behavior emulates the analog and non-volatile properties of biological synapses and enables the creation of a simple reservoir computing system. To illustrate its capabilities, the device is used in a waveform classification task, where the voltage amplitude range and magnetic bias field are tuned to optimize the recognition accuracy.</description>

      <title>Formation of Fe-6.5wt%Si High Silicon Steel by Double Glow Plasma Surface Metallurgy Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High silicon steel with 6.5% silicon content is the best because of its excellent magnetic properties, such as high saturation magnetization, high resistivity, low iron loss and near zero magnetostriction. High silicon steel can greatly save energy, and reduce the weight and size of electrical appliances. This has a very important application prospect for energy and aerospace industry. The high brittleness of high silicon steel makes its production and processing very difficult. For more than 30 years, many steel companies and research institutions around the world have adopted various technical means to study the industrialization of high silicon steel, but they have not been successful . JFE-NKK steel company in Japan has realized the small batch production of high silicon steel by using SiCl4-CVD technology. However, due to the complex process, corrosion and pollution, high cost, its production scale is greatly limited. So far, large-scale production of high silicon steel is still a major challenge in the world. This paper will introduce the experimental results of successfully preparing high silicon steel by Double Glow Plasma Surface Metallurgy Technology. The process is simple and easy without any corrosion or pollution, which may provide a new way for the world to achieve large-scale production of high silicon steel. The large-scale production and wide application of high silicon steel is likely to change the pattern of the world's energy and electric power industry, save a lot of energy for mankind, and create huge economic benefits.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Freeform Metasurfaces: A Platform for Advanced Broadband Dispersion Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, with their ability to control electromagnetic waves, hold immense potential in optical device design, especially for applications requiring precise control over dispersion. This work introduces an approach to dispersion engineering using heterogeneous freeform metasurfaces, which overcomes the limitations of conventional metasurfaces that often suffer from poor transmission, narrow bandwidth, and restricted polarization responses. By transitioning from single-layer, canonical meta-atoms to bilayer architectures with non-intuitive geometries, our design decouples intrinsic material properties (refractive index and group index), enabling independent engineering of phase and group delays as well as higher-order dispersion properties, while achieving high-efficiency under arbitrary polarization states. We implement a two-stage multi-objective optimization process to generate libraries of meta-atoms, which are then utilized for the rapid design of dispersion-engineered metasurfaces. Additionally, we present a bilayer metasurface stacking technique, paving the way for the realization of high-performance, dispersion-engineered optical devices. Our approach is validated through the demonstration of metasurfaces exhibiting superior chromatic aberration correction and broadband performance, with over 81% averaged efficiency across the 420-nm visible-to-near-infrared bandwidth. Our synergistic combination of advanced design physics, powerful freeform optimization methods, and bi-layer nanofabrication techniques represents a significant breakthrough compared to the state-of-the-art while opening new possibilities for broadband metasurface applications.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticle doping as a way to enhance holmium fiber lasers efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly-doped holmium fibers have been prepared using modified chemical vapor deposition in combination with nanoparticle-doping method. Within a series of various Al2O3 and Ho3+ concentrations, relations between fibers composition and their fluorescence and laser parameters have been studied. Al/Ho molar ratio equal to at least 50 was found to be the key factor for fibers with outstanding parameters. Fibers with slope efficiency above 80%, laser threshold below 100 mW and fluorescence lifetime up to 1.6 ms have been prepared. Thanks to high Al2O3 concentrations, obtained through nanoparticle doping, we were able to achieve high-performance fibers in a wide range of Ho3+ concentrations. An output power of 19 W with 81% slope efficiency was reached using fiber with almost 4000 ppm of Ho3+ and 10 mol.% of Al2O3. This result is encouraging for highly efficient high-power cladding-pumped holmium fiber lasers, and studied relations between fibers composition and their laser parameters will be used in the designing of such laser sources.</description>

      <title>On the low frequency flexural band gaps of a metamaterial plate with low porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates numerically and experimentally that it is possible to tailor flexural band gaps in the low-frequency regime by appropriate choice of cutout characteristics. The finite element method is used to obtain the numerical dispersion relation and band gaps. The influence of the cutout's shape, size, and location on the band gap is systematically studied. The study demonstrates that the cutout should pass through the center of the unit cell, and a large aspect ratio is required to introduce flexural band gaps in the low-frequency regime. This is validated by experiments on a finite plate with 3 $\times$ 3 unit cells.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models for Colloidal Nanocrystal Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal synthesis of nanocrystals usually includes complex chemical reactions and multi-step crystallization processes. Despite the great success in the past 30 years, it remains challenging to clarify the correlations between synthetic parameters of chemical reaction and physical properties of nanocrystals. Here, we developed a deep learning-based nanocrystal synthesis model that correlates synthetic parameters with the final size and shape of target nanocrystals, using a dataset of 3500 recipes covering 348 distinct nanocrystal compositions. The size and shape labels were obtained from transmission electron microscope images using a segmentation model trained with a semi-supervised algorithm on a dataset comprising 1.2 million nanocrystals. By applying the reaction intermediate-based data augmentation method and elaborated descriptors, the synthesis model was able to predict nanocrystal's size with a mean absolute error of 1.39 nm, while reaching an 89% average accuracy for shape classification. The synthesis model shows knowledge transfer capabilities across different nanocrystals with inputs of new recipes. With that, the influence of chemicals on the final size of nanocrystals was further evaluated, revealing the importance order of nanocrystal composition, precursor or ligand, and solvent. Overall, the deep learning-based nanocrystal synthesis model offers a powerful tool to expedite the development of high-quality nanocrystals.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Magnon-Magnon Coupling and Its Dynamic Control in Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonics, exploring the coupling between magnons and quantum systems, is an exciting field for developing next-generation information technologies. Achieving a strong and tunable magnon-magnon coupling (MMC) in confined nanomagnets is crucial for the on-chip integration of these hybrid systems and advancing the field. In this work, we numerically investigate the interactions between different magnon modes excited within an elliptical magnonic nano-disc (EMND), demonstrating an anti-crossing effect in the dispersion spectra. A comprehensive theoretical framework was presented that explains this anti-crossing phenomenon as a result of MMC and provide estimates for the strength of the coupling (g). Furthermore, we show that this intermodal coupling can be tuned from a strong coupling regime (g = 300 MHz) to a weak coupling regime by varying the direction of the external magnetic field and the intrinsic properties of the EMND. Our combined numerical and theoretical findings offer new insights into MMC, significantly advancing the field of quantum magnonics and magnon-based quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Broadband Unidirectional Visible Imaging Using Wafer-Scale Nano-Fabrication of Multi-Layer Diffractive Optical Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a broadband and polarization-insensitive unidirectional imager that operates at the visible part of the spectrum, where image formation occurs in one direction while in the opposite direction, it is blocked. This approach is enabled by deep learning-driven diffractive optical design with wafer-scale nano-fabrication using high-purity fused silica to ensure optical transparency and thermal stability. Our design achieves unidirectional imaging across three visible wavelengths (covering red, green and blue parts of the spectrum), and we experimentally validated this broadband unidirectional imager by creating high-fidelity images in the forward direction and generating weak, distorted output patterns in the backward direction, in alignment with our numerical simulations. This work demonstrates the wafer-scale production of diffractive optical processors, featuring 16 levels of nanoscale phase features distributed across two axially aligned diffractive layers for visible unidirectional imaging. This approach facilitates mass-scale production of ~0.5 billion nanoscale phase features per wafer, supporting high-throughput manufacturing of hundreds to thousands of multi-layer diffractive processors suitable for large apertures and parallel processing of multiple tasks. Our design can seamlessly integrate into conventional optical systems, broadening its applicability in fields such as security, defense, and telecommunication. Beyond broadband unidirectional imaging in the visible spectrum, this study establishes a pathway for artificial-intelligence-enabled diffractive optics with versatile applications, signaling a new era in optical device functionality with industrial-level massively scalable fabrication.</description>

      <title>Robust Characterization of Integrated Photonics Directional Couplers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional couplers are essential components in integrated photonics. Given their widespread use, accurate characterization of directional couplers is crucial for ensuring optimal performance. However, it is challenging due to the coupling between fibers and waveguides, which is highly sensitive to alignment and fabrication imperfections. To address these challenges, we propose a novel direct measurement technique that offers greater robustness to variations in optical interfaces, while bypassing extinction ratio measurements. Our method enables a broadband and precise characterization of the directional couplers' splitting ratio. We experimentally validate this approach, demonstrate its robustness against intentional errors, and compare it to a naive direct measurement method. Furthermore, our technique is generalized to measure the amplitude of any general 2x2 unitary circuit, providing valuable insights for designing and testing a wide range of photonic integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Self-regulated photoresponsive heterogeneous PNIPAM hydrogel actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-regulated actuators harness material intelligence to enable complex deformations and dynamics, representing a significant advancement in automated soft robotics. However, investigations on self-regulated soft actuators, particularly those using simplified actuation modules such as a unidirectional light beam, remain limited. Here, we present a design paradigm for self-regulated actuators based on Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) heterogeneous hydrogel, where self-regulated deformations are actuated by a fixed near-infrared laser. By utilizing the different responsiveness of PNIPAM hydrogels and those integrated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), we develop three heterogeneous hydrogel configurations: up-down, side-by-side, and hybrid. These designs enable complex biomimetic deformations in soft hydrogel actuators, resembling a bending finger or a flexible industrial manipulator, all actuated by a single fixed laser source. These proposed heterogeneous designs and actuation strategies leverage material intelligence to create soft actuators with enhanced autonomy, paving the way for soft automation, adaptive systems, and biomedical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11705v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colour printing based on metallic or dielectric nanostructures has revolutionized colour science due to its unprecedented subwavelength resolution. Evidently, the evolution towards the active control of such structural colours with smart materials is in progress for real applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate a large colour gamut with high intensity and purity, as well as its switching on and off based solely on tungsten trioxide (WO3) cylindrical resonators. The strong resonances in the visible spectral range in these WO3 metasurfaces can be reversibly switched on and off due to its electrochromism by applying alternating voltages of +2.0 V and -0.3 V.

      <title>Photoacoustic microscopy with meta-optics</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in the miniaturization of optical elements have led to the emergence of novel imaging systems, used for industrial and consumer-based applications. The underlying methods are particularly prevalent in the realms of medical imaging and optical microscopy. Avoiding bulky optical elements can be extremely beneficial to many microscopy modalities, one of which is photoacoustic microscopy. Relying on short, highly focused light pulses that need to be precisely controlled, large and heavy optical elements can often hinder the overall performance of such systems. We propose the utilization of increasingly popular optical elements, so-called meta-optics, in the excitation path of a photoacoustic microscope. The metalenses, which were designed and used for this work, consist of sub-wavelength elements that enable elaborate phase control of incident light and multifunctionality within a single optical element. This allowed us to not only replace common optical elements in the excitation path of the photoacoustic microscope, completely omitting any conventional glass elements, but also to design an adapted lens, increasing the depth of field. With our work, we prove the benefit of meta-optics for photoacoustic microscopy by comparing two different metalenses to a conventional glass lens in simulations as well as experiments. We expect this to be a step into the direction of more advanced meta-optics being utilized in photoacoustic imaging setups.</description>

      <title>On the importance of Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion in the formation of a Ni-Au / p-GaN ohmic contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion mechanisms taking place during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under oxygen atmosphere of a Ni-Au/p-GaN contact are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It is shown that oxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact through the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion down to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal interface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line Method (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga interfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the top surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx at the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such contacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may play a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies associated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for reducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current flowing through the contact.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions impose fundamental limits on the brightness of continuous and pulsed electron beams. When multiple electrons leave a field emitter within a space-time volume of femtoseconds and nanometers, their mutual repulsion creates well-defined correlations in energy and time. Such correlations remain undetected in ensemble measurements that average over the statistics of the emission process. Here, we employ event-based and femtosecond-gated detection of photoelectron states to map Coulomb-correlated few-particle phase-space distributions. Inelastic electron-light scattering experiments performed on two-electron states reveal a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space. Reconstructing the phase-space density, we find an overall energy-time dispersion that is distinct from that of the two separated sub-ensembles forming the bimodal distribution. Our findings disentangle correlation-induced and dispersive contributions to the energy-time structure of few-electron pulses and promote future electron microscopy schemes enhanced by multi-electron states.</description>

      <title>Hybrid broadband conduction and amplitude-driven topological confinement of sound via synthetic acoustic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise wave manipulation has undoubtedly forged the technological landscape we thrive in today. Although our understanding of wave phenomena has come a long way since the earliest observations of desert dunes or ocean waves, the unimpeded development of mathematics has enabled ever more complex and exotic physical phenomena to be comprehensively described. Here, we take wave manipulation a step further by introducing an unprecedented synthetic acoustic crystal capable of realizing simultaneous linear broadband conduction and nonlinear topological insulation, depicting a robust amplitude-dependent mode localized deep within - i.e. an amplitude-driven topological confinement of sound. The latter is achieved by means of an open acoustic waveguide lined with a chain of nonlocally and nonlinearly coupled active electroacoustic resonators. Starting from a comprehensive topological model for classical waves, we demonstrate that different topological regimes can be accessed by increasing driving amplitude and that topological robustness against coupling disorder is a direct consequence of symmetric and simultaneous response between coupled resonators. Theoretical predictions are validated by a fully programmable experimental apparatus capable of realizing the real-time manipulation of metacrystal properties. In all, our results provide a solid foundation for future research in the design and manipulation of classical waves in artificial materials involving nonlinearity, nonlocality, and non-hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Methods for energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy with photon-counting and deconvolution techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic techniques are essential for studying material properties, but the small cross-sections of some methods may result in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the collected spectra. In this article we present methods, based on combining Bragg spectroscopy with photon counting and deconvolution algorithms, which increase the SNRs, making the spectra better suited to further analysis. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide for constructing spectra from camera images. The efficacy of these methods is validated on synthetic and experimental data, the latter coming from the field of high-energy density (HED) science, where x-ray spectroscopy is essential for the understanding of materials under extreme thermodynamic conditions.</description>

Abstract: Compensation of the generalized spherical aberration components is discussed for the plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. An example compensation rules are derived for the double-plane symmetric optical system containing reflective and refractive subsystems, which focus light in the orthogonal directions at the image plane. An economical anamorphic extension of the Cassegrain-type cylindrical mirror system has been simulated with a ray-tracing code. Anamorphic telescopes of the introduced type provide independent focal distances in the two orthogonal planes allowing to set up a favorable field of view.</description>

Abstract: We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.</description>

      <title>Level attraction from interference in two-tone driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent and dissipative couplings, respectively characterised by energy level repulsion and attraction, each have different applications for quantum information processing. Thus, a system in which both coherent and dissipative couplings are tunable on-demand and in-situ is tantalising. A first step towards this goal is the two-tone driving of two bosonic modes, whose experimental signature was shown to exhibit controllable level repulsion and attraction by changing the phase and amplitude of one drive. However, whether the underlying physics is that of coherent and dissipative couplings has not been clarified, and cannot be concluded solely from the measured resonances (or anti-resonances) of the system. Here, we show how the physics at play can be analysed theoretically. Combining this theory with realistic finite-element simulations, we deduce that the observation of level attraction originates from interferences due to the measurement setup, and not dissipative coupling. Beyond the clarification of a novel origin for level attraction attributed to interference, our work demonstrate how effective Hamiltonians can be derived to appropriately describe the physics.</description>

      <title>Transistors based on Novel 2-D Monolayer Semiconductors Bi2O2Se, InSe, and MoSi2N4 for Enhanced Logic Density Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making ultra-short gate-length transistors significantly contributes to scaling the contacted gate pitch. This, in turn, plays a vital role in achieving smaller standard logic cells for enhanced logic density scaling. As we push the boundaries of miniaturization, it is intriguing to consider that the ultimate limit of contacted gate pitch could be reached with remarkable 1 nm gate-length transistors. Here, we identify InSe, Bi2O2Se, and MoSi2N4 as potential two-dimensional semiconductors for 1 nm transistors with low contact resistance and outstanding interface properties. We employ a fully self-consistent ballistic quantum transport model starting from first-principle calculations. Our simulations show that the interplay between electrostatics and quantum tunneling influences the performance of these devices over the device design space. MoSi2N4 channels have the best immunity to quantum tunneling, and Bi2O2Se channel devices have the best electrostatics. We show that for a channel length of 12 nm, all the devices can deliver I_$ON$/I_$OFF$ &gt; 10^3 , suitable for electronic applications, and Bi2O2Se is the best-performing channel material.</description>
