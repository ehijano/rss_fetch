      <title>Ab initio description of $\bar{p}+\rm{^3H}$ and $\bar{p}+\rm{^3He}$ systems in optical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the ongoing PUMA experiment (CERN), which investigates antiproton annihilation on atomic nuclei, we study the energy shifts and widths of Rydberg states in the $\bar{p}+\rm{^3H}$ and $\bar{p}+\rm{^3He}$ systems by performing ab initio calculations. The scattering lengths and scattering volumes are first determined by solving the Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations in configuration space. The level shifts and widths of the corresponding $\bar{p} \, \rm{^3H}$ and $\bar{p} \, \rm{^3He}$ hydrogen-like states are then obtained using the Trueman formula. A pronounced model dependence associated with the nucleon-antinucleon interaction is observed for certain states. Finally, annihilation densities are computed from the four-body wavefunctions. Comparison with the nuclear density distributions indicates that the nucleon-antinucleon annihilation is predominantly peripheral.</description>

      <title>Entanglement study in the island of inversion region using \textit{ab initio} approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement provides a unique perspective for probing nuclear structure. In this work, we employ quantum entanglement measures, including proton-neutron entanglement entropy, mutual information, and quantum relative entropy, to investigate the evolution of entanglement patterns as we approach neutron-rich nuclei. The study is carried out in the vicinity of the $N=20$ island of inversion region consisting of even-$A$ Ne, Mg, and Si isotopes, and also for isotones corresponding to $N=20$. The state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} valence space in-medium similarity renormalization group method has been used for this purpose. We have highlighted the role of proton-neutron entanglement entropy in the formation of the island of inversion region. While mutual information provides insight into the strong correlations between proton-proton and neutron-neutron single-particle orbitals. The correlations are weak between proton and neutron for ground states, but become comparable to like-particle correlations for excited states. The quantum relative entropy is also studied between $0^+$ and $2^+$ states of the Ne, Mg, and Si isotopes, as well as $N=20$ isotones, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Jensen-Shannon divergence. We have performed these calculations using partitions based on proton-neutron, single-particle states, and Slater determinants.</description>

      <title>Unfolding of exotic near-threshold structure and decay dynamics in $^{17}$B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron-rich boron isotopes provide a valuable testing ground for threshold-driven structure and reaction phenomena, including halo formation and exotic decay modes. In particular, the structure of $^{17}\mathrm{B}$ and its relation to unbound $^{16}\mathrm{B}$ are of special interest. The $^{16}\mathrm{B}$ nucleus is slightly unbound by approximately $50~\mathrm{keV}$, while $^{17}\mathrm{B}$ is bound with a neutron separation energy of about $1.4-1.6~\mathrm{MeV}$. The observation of a $1640~\mathrm{keV}$ $\gamma$ ray in $^{17}\mathrm{B}$, which we argue originates from a $1/2^-$ excited state, points to a remarkable situation in which $\gamma$ decay and two-neutron decay can compete. We analyze and identify the main reasons for this competition: $L=2$ emission of the neutron pair, and structural realignment driven by the proximity of the one-body threshold, in particular the nearby $s$-wave neutron decay channel. The decay is a unique near-threshold $L=2$ process in which multiple structural components contribute, each with coexisting direct and virtual sequential amplitudes whose interference governs the observables. Because threshold dynamics, continuum coupling, and interference of multiple quantum pathways are universal, closely related scenarios arise in ultracold atoms near Feshbach resonances, few-body atomic and molecular breakups, mesoscopic and photonic open systems, and other areas where open-quantum-system effects impact observables. We employ advanced theoretical models to study this first-of-its-kind case and provide a coherent theoretical perspective based on configuration interaction and complex-energy formalisms that incorporate both reaction continuum and structural effects near threshold.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network for Solving the Diffusion Equation in the Expanding QCD Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the diffusion of heavy quarks within the expanding hot QCD medium generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to the strong coupling between heavy quarks and the bulk medium, the evolution of heavy quarks can be effectively characterized by a diffusion equation. This approach assumes the instantaneous kinetic thermalization of heavy quarks following their production in nuclear collisions. The local density of heavy quarks is intrinsically coupled to the velocity profile of the hot QCD medium. By incorporating the fluid velocity profiles provided by a hydrodynamic model directly into the diffusion equation, we utilize the deep neural network (DNN) to efficiently determine the heavy-quark evolution. Furthermore, this work provides a valuable reference for the application of deep learning techniques to the treatment of non-thermalized heavy-quark dynamics. The rapid calculation of heavy-quark diffusion using DNNs further facilitates the study of heavy-quark coalescence within a large ensemble of fluctuating hot media.</description>

      <title>Multi-Physics Bayesian Analysis of Neutron Star Crust Using Relativistic Mean-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of neutron-star crust within a Bayesian framework based on a unified relativistic mean-field (RMF) description of dense matter. The analysis focuses on the posterior distributions of crust properties, constrained by nuclear experimental data, chiral effective field theory, and multimessenger neutron-star observations. In the inference, the outer crust is fixed using the AME2020 nuclear mass table, supplemented by Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov mass models, while the inner crust is described using a compressible liquid-drop model consistently coupled to the RMF interaction. The same RMF framework is used to describe the uniform core, ensuring a unified treatment across all density regimes. From the resulting posteriors, we extract key crustal observables, including the crust--core transition density and pressure, crust thickness, crust mass, and the fractional crustal moment of inertia. We find that the transition density is primarily governed by the symmetry-energy slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$ evaluated at sub-saturation densities, while the transition pressure plays a central role in determining global crustal properties. The inner-crust equation of state reflects a collective interplay between isovector nuclear-matter properties rather than a dependence on any single parameter. We also assess the impact of using matched crust--core constructions and show that they can introduce systematic differences in predicted neutron-star properties when compared with fully unified treatments.</description>

      <title>Learning the relations between neutron star and nuclear matter properties with symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in neutron stars (NSs) remains uncertain, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where complex nuclear interactions and the potential presence of exotic matter, like hyperons, come into play. The complex relationships existing between nuclear matter and neutron star properties are investigated. The focus is on their nonlinearities and interdependencies. In our analysis, we apply a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression, paired with principal component analysis, to datasets generated from Bayesian inference over relativistic mean-field models. A systematic Principal Component Analysis has allowed to break down the percentage contribution of each element or feature in the relationships obtained. This study examines two main models (datasets): the NL model, which includes nucleonic degrees of freedom; and the NL-hyp model, which includes hyperons in addition to nucleons. Our analysis confirms a robust correlation between the tidal deformability of a 1.4 \(M_\odot\) neutron star and $\beta$-equilibrium pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density. This correlation remains once hyperons are included. The contribution of the different nuclear matter properties at saturation to the radius and tidal deformability was calculated. It was shown that the isovector properties have the largest impact, with a contribution of about 90\%. We also studied the relationship between the proton fraction at different densities and various symmetry energy parameters defined at saturation density. For the hyperon data set, we took into account the effects of the negatively charged hyperon $\Xi$ in order to recover the relationships. Our study reveals the individual impact of various symmetry energy parameters on proton fractions at different densities.</description>

      <title>Direct transfer to $^{46,48}$K as a survey of the $\pi(s_{1/2})$$-\nu(sdpf)$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of the canonical $N=28$ magic number in nuclei with $Z&lt;20$ has drawn significant interest as it relates to the emergence of an island of inversion centered on $^{42}$Si and $^{44}$S. In particular, interactions between the $\pi s_{1/2}$ orbital -- empty in $^{42}$Si and full in $^{44}$S -- and the neutron orbitals just above and below the $N=28$ gap are expected to be critical in this region, but remain relatively unexplored. In this paper, we expand upon the results of our previous study of the direct transfer reaction $^{47}$K(d,p$\gamma$)$^{48}$K [C.\,J.~Paxman \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 162504 (2025)] with the results of the complementary $^{47}$K(d,t$\gamma$)$^{46}$K reaction. Through this study, we present a comprehensive scan of the interaction between the critical $\pi s_{1/2}$ orbital and a broad range of neutron orbitals spanning nearly two full shells. We identify several discrepancies between the experimental results and state-of-the-art shell model calculations, which suggest a deficiency of the shell model to fully capture the complex proton configuration mixing in this region, highlighting a significant challenge for single-particle descriptions of the island of inversion.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Probes of Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study leptonic decays of hadrons as probes of light neutrinophilic scalars that mediate enhanced neutrino self-interactions. Such scalars can be emitted in processes involving neutrinos, turning two-body decays into three-body final states and producing characteristic spectral distortions. We compute these effects for charged pion decay and nuclear electron capture decay, including both on-shell and off-shell scalar emission, as well as the loop-induced renormalization required to cancel divergences. Using these results, we derive the projected sensitivity of PIONEER and assess the current and future reach of BeEST. The resulting low-energy spectral tails provide a characteristic signal for light neutrinophilic scalars, making upcoming hadron decay experiments powerful probes of light mediators of non-standard neutrino self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD determination of the $\gamma Z$ box contribution to the proton weak charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\gamma Z$ box contribution to parity-violating electron-proton scattering, $\square_{\gamma Z}$ , a key ingredient for the precise tests of the Standard Model via the proton weak charge. Our calculation covers the electron beam energies up to $E =155 MeV$. For the axial-vector component, we achieve reduced uncertainties across the entire energy range compared with phenomenological estimates. For the vector component, the uncertainties remain slightly larger after continuum extrapolation. At $E = 0$, where the vector part vanishes, we obtain $\square_{\gamma Z}= 0.00412(9)$ , reducing the uncertainty by a factor of $2$ relative to the most precise previous determination. Incorporating this result yields an updated weak charge of $Q_{W}^{p}= 0.06987(50)$ . The calculated energy dependence of $\square_{\gamma Z}$ further provides a first-principles input for the upcoming P2 experiment at Mainz, which will operate at the optimized beam energy of $155 MeV$ to extract $Q_{W}^p$.</description>

      <title>Probing the microscopic origin of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ production through event-shape engineering in proton-proton collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-flavour hadrons are produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic collisions at the LHC via hard partonic interactions and experience the whole system evolution. The study of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ mesons provides an independent avenue to test the theories of quantum chromodynamics and to investigate beauty hadron production. Moreover, the production of both prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ is influenced by microscopic processes such as multi-partonic interactions (MPI) and hadronisation through fragmentation. In this study, an attempt is made to understand the production of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using the PYTHIA8 event generator, which offers a qualitative description of charm production. The role of the transverse momentum transfer in the hardest partonic scattering ($\hat{p}_{\rm T}$), MPI, and color reconnection is systematically explored. In addition, the charged particle production in different topological regions with respect to the leading $D^{0}$ meson is studied to assess the influence of the $D^{0}$ meson on the event topology and to examine the selection biases arising from the use of charged particle multiplicity as an event classifier.</description>

      <title>EPOS4 Model Predictions for Global Observables in Pb-Pb Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of nuclear matter, remains a central focus of high-energy heavy-ion collision experiments. The recent operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Run 3 at the new center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.36$ TeV necessitates theoretical predictions to characterize the energy dependence and bulk properties of the medium. In this study, we present comprehensive EPOS4 model predictions for key global observables in Pb-Pb collisions at $5.36$ TeV. We focus on the centrality dependence of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density ($dN_{ch}/d\eta$), integrated yields ($dN/dy$), mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{T}\rangle$) for light-flavor hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}, K^{\pm}, p(\bar{p})$), and the charged particle nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$). The EPOS4 framework successfully captures the strong mass-dependent rise of $\langle p_{T}\rangle$ with multiplicity, a definitive signature of collective radial flow. Furthermore, the predicted charged hadron $R_{AA}$ demonstrates a clear suppression, consistent with energy loss mechanisms incorporated into the model. By comparing these predictions to existing $5.02$ TeV data, we demonstrate that the EPOS4 model offers a consistent and robust description of heavy-ion dynamics, projecting minimal energy evolution for these bulk and hard-probe observables between the two energies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical gluon effects in twist-3 generalized parton distributions of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Basis Light-Front Quantization framework, we systematically investigate the subleading-twist (twist-3) generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the proton's valence quarks beyond the Wandzura--Wilczek (WW) approximation. The twist-3 GPDs are not independent; through the equations of motion they decompose into a non-genuine contribution and a genuine twist-3 term. The latter encodes quark--quark--gluon correlations and involves interference between the light-front Fock sectors |qqq&gt; and |qqqg&gt;, which are typically neglected in the WW approximation. Using light-front wave functions obtained from diagonalizing the proton light-front Hamiltonian for its |qqq&gt; and |qqqg&gt; Fock components, we compute these GPDs via their overlap representations. To further explore their physical implications, we also evaluate several twist-3--related quantities, including the quark orbital angular momentum, the total quark spin contribution, and the quark spin--orbit correlation. Our results provide new nonperturbative input on higher-twist dynamics particularly multi-parton interference effects relevant for future measurements at the EicC and the EIC.</description>

Abstract: The in-medium nucleon-nucleon scattering cross section is a pivotal quantity for studying the medium effects of strong interaction, and its precise knowledge is critical for understanding the equation of state for dense matter, intermediate-energy heavy-ion collision dynamics, and related phenomena. In this work, we perform a microscopic investigation of in-medium nucleon-nucleon scattering cross sections, by utilizing the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory with the Bonn potential. The fully incorporation of both positive- and negative-energy states in the RBHF solutions allows us to determine the single-particle potentials, the effective G matrix, and the scattering cross section uniquely. The momentum, density, and isospin dependence of the cross section for pp, nn, and np scattering are studied in detail. Our results provide a solid foundation for future parametrization studies of multiparameter dependency of total scattering cross sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the three-nucleon contact potentials in the Jacobi partial-wave basis. The potentials are built in the separable form as the products of the antisymmetrized three-nucleon states in which the nucleons are arbitrarily close to each other. We compile the three-nucleon contact potentials up to $\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$. These contact potentials are by construction independent operators under exchanges of any nucleon pairs.</description>

      <title>Variations of the crossover and first-order phase transition curve in modeling the QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have shown that the transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons is a rapid crossover at $T = 155-160$ MeV at vanishing chemical potential. Many model calculations show that the transition is first-order at sufficiently high baryon chemical potential. It is then natural to expect the existence of a critical point where the crossover and first-order phase transition lines meet. We show how to embed a phase boundary that terminates at the critical point in a smooth background equation of state, using several different but closely related criteria, so as to yield the critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios expected of a transition in the 3D Ising and liquid-gas universality class. The crossover curves can be tuned to pass through experimental freeze-out data from heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The resulting equations of state can be used in hydrodynamic simulations of these collisions to probe the existence of a critical point and corresponding first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Behavior of Giant Monopole Resonance Energy with Nuclear Matter Incompressibility in the framework of Relativistic Mean Field Formalism and Coherent Density Fluctuation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite nucleus incompressibility $K^A$ is evaluated using the coherent density fluctuation model with the extended relativistic mean field density. The relativistic energy density functional for nuclear matter is replaced by the local density approximation for finite nuclei. The equation is used to calculate the finite nuclear incompressibility, which is further utilized to evaluate the isoscalar giant monopole excitation (ISGMR) energy $E_M$. This excitation energy is compared with other theoretical calculations and experimental data, wherever available. The results are comparable to the data. In contrast to the general understanding, the $E_M$ of finite nucleus is found to be maximum for the lowest nuclear matter incompressibility $K_{\infty}$, whereas it is minimum for the maximum $K_{\infty}$. These reverse results may be due to the self- and cross-interactions of the vector mesons in the nuclear potential.</description>

      <title>Color-superconducting quarkyonic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter under the conditions of color and electric neutrality at $\beta$- and strong equilibrium, as relevant for neutron stars. By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.</description>

      <title>Sub-barrier fusion enhancement due to positive Q-value four-neutron transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of positive $Q$-value four-neutron transfer (PQ4NT) effects on the sub-barrier capture cross sections is systematically investigated using the empirical barrier distribution (EBD2) method. For 13 fusion reactions with $Q_{4n}&gt;0$, sustained neutron-pair transfer is found to reduce barrier heights and enhance capture cross sections at sub-barrier energies. In contrast, reactions such as $^{18}$O+$^{58}$Ni, which have $Q_{2n}&gt;0$ but $Q_{4n}&lt;0$, exhibit no enhancement due to the stalling of subsequent neutron-pair transfer after the initial 2n transfer. By incorporating PQ4NT effects into EBD2 for systems with $Q_{4n}&gt;0$, the average deviation between predicted and experimental capture cross sections (113 datasets) is significantly reduced by $20\%$. Additionally, comparing with the systems induced by $^{48}$Ca ($Q_{4n}&lt;0$), much larger neutron pickup probabilities are observed in the quasi-elastic scattering of $^{40}$Ca-induced reactions ($Q_{4n}&gt;0$) from the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations.</description>

      <title>Modifications in clusterization procedures for heavy-ion collisions: minimum spanning tree, simulated annealing, coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02084v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new open-source cluster finding library ''Common Clusterization Library'' (CCL) is proposed to describe the clusters production when applied to the transport codes. The new library was applied to the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics approach to be comparable with the established and well known MST and SACA implementations on the exactly same set of the events. The presented procedures were tested with rapidity density distributions and complex observables like $\langle M_{imf} \rangle$ and $\langle Z_{\text{max}} \rangle$ vs $Z_{bound}2$ at the energies of ALADiN and NA49 experiments. An improvement to the simulated annealing chain is proposed to reduce the computational time. The new stable clusters tracking algorithm for the ''lost'' cluster recovering is presented. The results of the ''box-like'' coalescence procedure and a mixed method which incorporates the coalescence algorithm steps and the negative binding energy criteria are presented. The difference between the Helium-3 found by the MST-based cluster finding procedure and the coalescence algorithm applied on the exactly same set of events and baryons is shown for the first time.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking projected generator coordinate method for nuclear Gamow-Teller transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to achieve a minimal extension of the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method (PGCM) to describe Gamow-Teller (GT) transition strengths in even-even nuclei and to compute the NME of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Within the PGCM framework, the wave functions of odd-odd nuclei are constructed as superpositions of neutron and proton quasiparticle configurations built on quasiparticle vacua constrained to have, on average, odd neutron and odd proton particle numbers. The angular momentum and particle numbers associated with the underlying mean-field states are restored through projection techniques. Using a shell-model Hamiltonian defined in the $fp$ shell, we assess the validity of this approach by benchmarking GT transitions in calcium and titanium isotopes, as well as the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{48}$Ca to $^{48}$Ti, against exact solutions. For comparison, we also confront our results with those obtained from configuration-interaction calculations employing different particle-hole truncation schemes, both with and without in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) evolution.</description>

      <title>The Spectra of $p\bar\Lambda$ and $p\bar\Sigma$ Hexaquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of the $J^P = 1^+$ resonance $X(2085)$ in the $p\bar{\Lambda}$ system by the BESIII collaboration, we studied the molecular states of hexaquarks $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$ with baryon-antibaryon structures within the framework of the QCD sum rules. Non-perturbative contributions up to dimension 13 were considered in our analysis. The results indicate the existence of six possible molecular states $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$, with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{-}, 0^{+}, 1^{-}$. Consequently, the current sum rule results do not support the interpretation of $X(2085)$ as a $p\bar{\Lambda}$ or $p\bar{\Sigma}$ molecular state. On the other hand, we find that the masses of the proposed $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$ structures with $J^{P} = 1^{-}$ are in the vicinity of observed $X(2075)$, which implies that the nature of this state needs more invistigations. Moreover, the possible decay modes of the concerned hexaquark states are analyzed.</description>

      <title>$t$+$t$ cluster states in $^{6}$He</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of $t$+$t$ cluster states in $^{6}$He provides valuable insights into exotic nuclear structures and the behavior of fermionic cluster systems. This study shows rich cluster resonant state structures above the threshold, identified by experimental reconstruction and theoretical calculations. The excitation energy spectrum above the $t$+$t$ threshold in $^{6}$He is measured via the fragmentation excitation process during the breakup reaction of $^{9}$Li on a $^{208}$Pb target at an incident energy of 32.7 MeV/nucleon. The resonant states are reconstructed from the final state coincident particles $t$+$t$ using the invariant mass method, while the non-resonant background is estimated using the event mixing method. Two states of energy level peaks at $13.9\pm0.3$ and $15.0\pm0.3$ MeV are observed. Microscopic cluster model calculations exploring the $t+t$ resonant states in $^6\mathrm{He}$ yield theoretical energy spectra which are then compared with the current experimental results. The calculated reduced width amplitudes (RWA) of the $t+t$ channels further confirm the clustering structure of the identified $t+t$ resonant states.</description>

      <title>Investigations of symmetry breakings by multiple condensates on exotic chiral condensed phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu-Goldstone modes on the exiotic chiral condensed phase with chiral and tensor-type quark-antiquark condensates are investigated by using of the two-point vertex functions. It is shown that one of the Nambu-Goldstone modes appears as a result of meson-mixing. As is well known, another method to find the Nambu-Goldstone modes is given by the use of the algebraic commutation relations between broken generators and massless modes obtained through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method is adopted to the cases of the chiral symmetry breakings due to the tensor-type condensate and the inhomogeneous chiral condensate. The result obtained by the use of the meson two-point vertex functions is obviously reproduced in the case of the tensor-type condensate. Furthermore, we investigate the general rules for determining the broken symmetries and the Nambu-Goldstone modes algebraically. As examples, the symmetry breaking pattern and the Nambu-Goldstone modes due to the tensor-type condensate or the inhomogeneous chiral condensate are shown by adopting the general rules developed in this paper in the algebraic method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the finite-temperature perturbation theory of interacting scalar fields under external rotation. Because of the translational non-invariance in the radial direction, Green's functions are described using the Fourier-Bessel basis, instead of the conventional Fourier basis. We derive the leading-order correction to the partition function and the one-loop self-energy. The Feynman rules obtained in our perturbation theory shows that due to the finite-size effect required by the causality constraint, the zero-temperature thermodynamics in the perturbation theory is unaffected by rotation, similarly to that in the noninteracting theory.</description>

Abstract: The STAR Collaboration reports measurements of acoplanarity using semi--inclusive distributions of charged--particle jets recoiling from direct photon and $\pi^{0}$ triggers, in central Au+Au and $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV. Significant medium--induced acoplanarity broadening is observed for large but not small recoil jet resolution parameter, corresponding to recoil jet yield enhancement up to a factor of $\approx20$ for trigger--recoil azimuthal separation far from $\pi$. This phenomenology is indicative of the response of the Quark--Gluon Plasma to excitation, but not the scattering of jets off of its quasiparticles. The measurements are not well--described by current theoretical models which incorporate jet quenching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hadronic uncertainty from light-quark loops coupled to (anti)neutrino in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ permille level. This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the charge-isospin correlation function of quark currents. We study the charge-charge and charge-isospin correlators within $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ChPT, the two correlators are identical to all orders in the chiral and electromagnetic expansions. We further perform a leading-order $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ ChPT calculation and discuss the relevant counterterms. Our findings reduce the hadronic uncertainty in neutral-current processes such as (anti)neutrino-electron and coherent elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering by a factor $\sim 35$.</description>

      <title>Resonance Contributions to Radiative Corrections in Charged-Current (Anti)Neutrino-Nucleon Elastic Scattering at GeV Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation of virtual resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. We approximate the vector part of the $N \to \Delta$ transition by the leading magnetic dipole term. Our results for the cross-section corrections at fixed neutrino energy indicate the permille-level contribution of resonance intermediate states to the elastic and radiative scattering cross sections. This calculation exhibits the expected infrared behavior of the invariant amplitudes and unpolarized cross sections. Our findings provide important insights into inelastic excitations in the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory</title>

Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>Weak Charge Form Factor Determination at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the weak charge form factor, $F_W(Q^2)$, of nuclei over a continuous range of momentum transfers, $0\lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 0.1$ GeV$^2$, is essential for mapping out the distribution of neutrons in nuclei. The neutron density distribution has significant implications for a broad range of areas, including studies of nuclear structure, neutron stars, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, our knowledge of $F_W(Q^2)$ comes primarily from fixed target experiments that measure the parity-violating longitudinal electron spin asymmetry in coherent elastic electron-ion scattering. Fixed target experiments, such as CREX and PREX-1,2, have provided high-precision weak charge form factor extractions for the $^{48}{\rm Ca}$ and $^{208}{\rm Pb}$ nuclei, respectively. However, a major limitation of fixed target experiments is that they each provide data only at a single value of $Q^2$. With the proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) on the horizon, we explore its potential to impact the determination of the weak charge form factor. While it cannot compete with the precision of fixed target experiments, it can provide data over a wide and continuous range of $Q^2$ values, and for a wide variety of nuclei. We show that for integrated luminosities of $\mathcal{L} &gt; $ 200/$A$ fb$^{-1}$, where $A$ denotes the nucleus atomic weight, the EIC can be complementary to fixed target experiments, and can significantly impact constraints from CREX and PREX-1,2 by lifting degeneracies in theoretical models of the neutron density distribution.</description>
