      <title>Boundary Criticality in the 2d Random Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface $\mathcal{F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Ergodicity Problems of the Hybrid Monte Carlo Method using Radial Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its many advantages, the sensible application of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is often hindered by the presence of large - or even infinite - potential barriers. These potential barriers partition the configuration space into distinct sectors, which leads to ergodicity violations and biased measurements of observables. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting the HMC method with a multiplicative Metropolis-Hastings update in a so-called "radial direction" of the fields, which enables jumps over the aforementioned potential barriers at comparably low computational cost. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated for the Hubbard model, formulated in a non-compact space by means of a continuous Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. Our numerical results show that the radial updates successfully resolve the ergodicity violation, while simultaneously reducing autocorrelations.</description>

      <title>Hot (non-equilibrium) electron relaxation: A review of the ultra-fast phenomena in metals and superconductors (PART I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Two-Temperature Model (TTM) used extensively in the investigations of energy relaxation in photo-excited systems originated in the seminal work of M. I. Kaganov, I. M. Lifshitz, and L. V. Tanatarov (KLT) in 1957. The idea that with an ultra short laser pulse a temporal (transient) state of electrons in a metal can be created in which electrons after absorbing energy from the laser pulse heat up and their temperature becomes substantially greater than that of lattice was originated in the work of S. I. Anisimov, B. L. Kapeliovich, and T. L. Perel'man in 1974. The heated electron sub-system ("hot" electrons) loses its energy to phonon sub-system via electron-phonon scattering (relaxation) and thermodynamic equilibrium re-establishes over a time scale of a few pico-seconds (psecs) in metals. This field saw great developments in the 1980s and 1990s with the advent of femto-second (fsec) pump-probe spectroscopy. And from 2000 onwards focus shifted from non-equilibrium phenomena in simple metals to that in more complex systems including strongly correlated systems such as high Tc cuprate superconductors. In 1987, P. B. Allen re-visits the calculations of KLT and re-writes the electron-phonon heat transfer coefficient $\alpha$ in terms of a very important parameter in the theory of superconductivity. Year 2000 onwards, field saw the development of models that go beyond the original TTM. Very recently, field enters into atto-second domain. In this article, author attempts a rigorous and concise account of the entire development of this very fascinating area of research including a summary of the current research in this field.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent $GW$+EDMFT for semiconductors and insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical studies of semiconductors and band insulators are usually based on variants of the $GW$ method without full self-consistency, like single-shot $G^0W^0$ or quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$. Fully self-consistent $GW$ provides a poor description of the gap size and electronic structure due to the lack of vertex corrections. While it is hard to predict at which order corrections can be neglected, local vertex corrections to all orders can be consistently included by combining $GW$ with extended dynamical mean field theory (EDMFT). Here, we show that {\it ab initio} multitier $GW$+EDMFT calculations, which achieve full self-consistency in a suitably defined low-energy space, provide a remarkably accurate description of semiconductors and band insulators. Our results imply that despite the weak correlations, local vertex corrections are essential for a consistent treatment of this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Pomeranchuk instability of a topological crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematic quantum fluids appear in strongly interacting systems and break the rotational symmetry of the crystallographic lattice. In metals, this is connected to a well-known instability of the Fermi liquid-the Pomeranchuk instability. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we identified this instability in a highly unusual setting: on the surface of an elemental topological metal, arsenic. By directly visualizing the Fermi surface of the surface state via scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, we find that the Fermi surface gets deformed and becomes elliptical at the energies where the nematic state is present. Known instances of nematic instability typically need van-Hove singularities or multi-orbital physics as drivers. In contrast, the surface states of arsenic are essentially indistinguishable from well-confined isotropic Rashba bands near the Fermi level, rendering our finding the first realization of Pomeranchuk instability of the topological surface state.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Dyson Summation of Perturbation Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical system of approximations for summing both conventional perturbation theory and large N vector expansions of models in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. Each stage of the hierarchy consists of a closed set of nonlinear equations for one particle irreducible correlation functions with no more than K points and captures the perturbation expansion of each of those functions up to some finite order. As K goes to infinity the full Schwinger Dyson hierarchy is approached. We present an argument that for ordinary finite dimensional integrals, the procedure converges to the exact answer in this limit, despite the fact that no finite order of the hierarchy sees effects from non-leading saddle points of the integral. Some potential applications to the calculation of critical exponents, to low dimensional condensed matter systems, and to the phase structure of the homogeneous electron gas are outlined, but no detailed calculations are presented.</description>

      <title>Solving quantum impurity models in the non-equilibrium steady state with tensor trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the evaluation of the integrals for intermediate-order diagrams in the self-consistent strong-coupling expansion on the Keldysh contour using Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI). TCI is used to factorize the nested parts of the integrand, allowing the integral to be computed as a recursion of convolution integrals, which are efficiently evaluated using the Fast Fourier Transform. The evaluation of diagrams where all vertices lie on one branch of the Keldysh contour resembles the structure of the imaginary-time formalism. For diagrams with time arguments on both contour branches, we find that it can be advantageous to parametrize the integrals in terms of physical time arguments with an additional sum over Keldysh indices. We benchmark the solution in relevant test cases, including the single impurity Anderson model and an exactly solvable electron-boson model. While the bond dimension increases with diagram order, the TCI-based integration efficiently handles low-order diagrams, making it a promising approach to go beyond the non-crossing approximation in steady-state non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory simulations.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically an Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>1D Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in thermal equilibrium via Non-Hermitian Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking generally circumvents one-dimensional systems with local interactions in thermal equilibrium. Here, we analyze a category of one-dimensional Hermitian models via local non-Hermitian constructions. Notably, spontaneous symmetry breaking and long-range order may emerge at finite temperatures in such systems under periodic boundary conditions, in sharp contrast to Hermitian constructions. We demonstrate clear numerical evidence, such as order parameters and specific heat, supporting phase diagrams with robust ordered phases. Non-Hermitian physics plays a vital role in prohibiting domain-wall proliferation and promoting spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions exhibit an exotic topological nature in their path-integral windings, which uphold nonzero integers -- commonly a non-Hermitian signature -- in the ordered phases, thus offering a novel and spontaneous origin for both symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Bound States in the Continuum in a 2D Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are quantum states that remain localized despite existing within a continuum of extended, delocalized states. They defy conventional wave theories and could be instrumental for quantum technologies that rely on the precise control of quantum states. While optical BICs have been realized in photonic systems, achieving electronic bound states in a metallic background remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we observe two defect states that remain localized within the metallic continuum of Pd5AlI2, a two-dimensional van der Waals metal. The emergence of these states is a manifestation of the hopping interference in the Pd5AlI2 lattice. This interference results in a (quasi) flat band and spatially localized eigenstates that are orthogonal to the metallic continuum thus avoiding hybridization with extended states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Hall conductance and its non-abelian and higher-dimensional analogs are obstructions to promoting a symmetry of a state to a gauge symmetry. To do this, we define a local Lie algebra over a Grothendieck site as a pre-cosheaf of Lie algebras with additional properties and propose that a gauge symmetry should be described by such an object. We show that infinitesimal symmetries of a gapped state of a quantum spin system form a local Lie algebra over a site of semilinear sets and use it to construct topological invariants of the state. Our construction applies to lattice systems on arbitrary asymptotically conical subsets of a Euclidean space including those which cannot be studied using field theory.</description>

      <title>Microscopy of bosonic charge carriers in staggered magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom is believed to underlie various unresolved phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Quantum simulators based on neutral atoms provide an excellent testbed for investigating such phenomena and resolving their microscopic origins. Up to now, the majority of experimental and theoretical studies has focused on systems with fermionic exchange statistics. Here we expand the existing cold atom toolbox through the use of negative temperature states, enabling us to realize an antiferromagnetic, bosonic $t-J$ model in two spatial dimensions, subject to a strong staggered magnetic field in a quantum gas microscope. Through comparison of the spreading dynamics of a single hole in a N\'eel versus a spin-polarized initial state, we establish the relevance of memory effects resulting from the buildup of strong spin-charge correlations in the dynamics of charge carriers in antiferromagnets. We further numerically predict rich dynamics of pairs of doped holes, which we demonstrate to be bound by a similar memory effect, while their center-of-mass can expand freely. Our work paves the way for the systematic exploration of the effect of antiferromagnetic spin ordering on the properties of individual charge carriers as well as finite doping phases: Our study demonstrates that the staggered field can be used to single out the effect of antiferromagnetism and holds the prospect to prepare low-temperature states in the near future.</description>

      <title>The product structure of MPS-under-permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods have proved to be highly effective in addressing a wide variety of physical scenarios, including those lacking an intrinsic one-dimensional geometry. In such contexts, it is possible for the problem to exhibit a weak form of permutational symmetry, in the sense that entanglement behaves similarly across any arbitrary bipartition. In this paper, we show that translationally-invariant (TI) matrix product states (MPS) with this property are trivial, meaning that they are either product states or superpositions of a few of them. The results also apply to non-TI generic MPS, as well as further relevant examples of MPS including the W state and the Dicke states in an approximate sense. Our findings motivate the usage of ans\"atze simpler than tensor networks in systems whose structure is invariant under permutations.</description>

      <title>Improved performance of polycrystalline antiferromagnet/ferromagnet stack by nitrogen assisted deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deposition process of the IrMn$_3$/Co$_{70}$Fe$_{30}$ bilayer of antiferromagnet/ferromagnet (AF/FM) type was modified by introducing a nitrogen additive in argon plasma during the magnetron sputtering of the Co$_{70}$Fe$_{30}$ layer. This slight modification significantly enhanced the exchange bias energy of the AF/FM bilayer for an IrMn layer thickness ranging from 20{\AA} to 50{\AA} and reduced the coercivity of the FM layer. Calculations indicate that the boost in exchange bias energy and the reduction in coercivity can be attributed to the increased anisotropy energy of the antiferromagnet, resulting in more effective pinning of the ferromagnet by antiferromagnetic grains. The increase in anisotropy is caused by the diffusion of nitrogen from the FM into the AF layer, as established by X-ray diffraction, Neutron Reflectometry, and X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism. Our research allows to improve magnetic characteristics of exchange-coupled FM/AF structures through minor modifications in the sputtering process and/or save up to 20% of the costly IrMn$_3$ target by reducing the thickness of the AF layer.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of non-chiral topological phases in 2D fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, fermionic topological phases of quantum matter has attracted a lot of attention. In a pioneer work by Gu, Wang and Wen, the concept of equivalence classes of fermionic local unitary(FLU) transformations was proposed to systematically understand non-chiral topological phases in 2D fermion systems and an incomplete classification was obtained. On the other hand, the physical picture of fermion condensation and its corresponding super pivotal categories give rise to a generic mathematical framework to describe fermionic topological phases of quantum matter. In particular, it has been pointed out that in certain fermionic topological phases, there exists the so-called q-type anyon excitations, which have no analogues in bosonic theories. In this paper, we generalize the Gu, Wang and Wen construction to include those fermionic topological phases with q-type anyon excitations. We argue that all non-chiral fermionic topological phases in 2+1D are characterized by a set of tensors $(N^{ij}_{k},F^{ij}_{k},F^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kln,\chi\delta},n_{i},d_{i})$, which satisfy a set of nonlinear algebraic equations parameterized by phase factors $\Xi^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kl}$, $\Xi^{ij}_{kln,\chi\delta}$, $\Omega^{kim,\alpha\beta}_{jl}$ and $\Omega^{ki}_{jln,\chi\delta}$. Moreover, consistency conditions among algebraic equations give rise to additional constraints on these phase factors which allow us to construct a topological invariant partition for an arbitrary triangulation of 3D spin manifold. Finally, several examples with q-type anyon excitations are discussed, including the Fermionic topological phase from Tambara-Yamagami category for $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$, which can be regarded as the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ parafermion generalization of Ising fermionic topological phase.</description>

      <title>Supervised learning of an interacting 2D hard-core boson model of a weak topological insulator using correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a system of hard-core bosons on a two-dimensional periodic honeycomb lattice subjected to an on-site potential with alternating signs along $y$-direction, using machine learning (ML) techniques. The model hosts a rich phase diagram consisting of six different phases including a charge density wave, a superfluid phase and two dimer insulator phases, one of which is also a weak topological insulator with zero Chern number but a non-trivial Berry phase [SciPost Phys. 10, 059 (2021)]. Using two distinct correlation functions computed via quantum Monte Carlo method, a relatively simple ML model is able to learn information from the various phases simultaneously and accurately predict their phase boundaries. By employing our ML model trained on the dataset obtained from the Hamiltonian without explicit interactions, we determine the phase structure of the system in the presence of nearest-neighbor interactions. Additionally, we investigate the robustness of the weak topological insulator phase against interactions by predicting the topological invariant, which is otherwise difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Magnon-Polariton spectroscopy of strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin excitations in LiHoF4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first present a formalism that incorporates the input-output formalism and the linear response theory to employ cavity-magnon-polariton coupling as a spectroscopic tool for investigating strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin excitations. A microscopic relation between the generalized susceptibility and the scattering parameter |S11| in strongly hybridized cavity-magnon-polariton systems has been derived without resorting to semi-classical approximations. The formalism is then applied to both analyze and simulate a specific systems comprising a model quantum Ising magnet (LiHoF4) and a high-finesse 3D re-entrant cavity resonator. Quantitative information on the electro-nuclear spin states in LiHoF4 is extracted, and the experimental observations across a broad parameter range were numerically reproduced, including an external magnetic field titraversing a quantum critical point. The method potentially opens a new avenue not only for further studies on the quantum phase transition in LiHoF4 but also for a wide range of complex magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Topological fingerprints in Liouvillian gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology in many-body physics usually emerges as a feature of equilibrium quantum states. We show that topological fingerprints can also appear in the relaxation rates of open quantum systems. To demonstrate this we consider one of the simplest models that has two topologically distinct phases in its ground state: the Kitaev chain model for the $p$-wave superconductor. After introducing dissipation to this model we estimate the Liouvillian gap in both strong and weak dissipative limits. Our results show that a non-zero superconducting pairing opens a Liouvillian gap that remains open in the limit of infinite system size. At strong dissipation this gap is essentially unaffected by the topology of the underlying Hamiltonian ground state. In contrast, when dissipation is weak, the topological phase of the Hamiltonian ground state plays a crucial role in determining the character of the Liouvillian gap. We find, for example, that in the topological phase this gap is completely immune to changes in the chemical potential. On the other hand, in the non-topological phase the Liouvillian gap is suppressed by a large chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Exploring quantum criticality and ergodicity-breaking dynamics in spin-1 Kitaev chains via single-ion anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate topological gauge-theory terms and quantum criticality in a spin-1 Kitaev chain with general single-ion anisotropies (SIAs). The ground-state phase diagram, including the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) and gapless dimer phases, is determined by the infinite time evolving block decimation (iTEBD) method. A quantum phase transition between the KSL and dimer phases occurs by varying uniaxial SIA, analogous to the confinement-deconfinement transition in the lattice Schwinger model with a topological $\theta$ angle of $\pi$. Introducing rhombic SIA shifts this angle from $\pi$, resulting in $y$- and $x$-ferroquadrupole phases. The transition between these phases can occur through a crossover in the KSL phase or a genuine phase transition along a deconfined line. We map the spin-1 Hamiltonian to an effective spin-1/2 PXP Hamiltonian, with uniaxial SIA corresponding to uniform detuning and rhombic SIA to staggered detuning. We explore the hierarchical fragmentation of the Hilbert space, revealing that quantum many-body scars (QMBSs) emerge under weak uniform detuning, while slow dynamics under large staggered detuning is accurately captured by a second-order effective Hamiltonian via the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. Our work establishes a framework for simulating topological $\theta$ angles and ergodicity-breaking dynamics, bridging higher-spin generalizations of scarred models with lattice gauge theories, potentially realizable using state-of-the-art cold-atom quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: We compute the structure of flux $h/(2e)$ vortices in a $d$-wave superconductor using a continuum SU(2) gauge theory of 2 flavors of charge $e$, SU(2)-fundamental Higgs bosons. Period-2 charge order is present near the vortex center. Upon coupling the electrons to the superconducting and charge order parameters, we find that the electronic local density of states does not have a zero-bias peak, in contrast to BCS theory. But there are sub-gap peaks at positive and negative bias, and these exhibit anti-phase periodic spatial modulations, as observed in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments in the underdoped cuprates (K. Matsuba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 063704 (2007)).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layered honeycomb material BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO) is of topical interest because its magnetic state is related to that of the Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using thermal transport to probe how magnetic excitations interact with phonons in the magnetically disordered regime, we have uncovered an unusually large enhancement of the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ in an in-plane magnetic field ${\bf H}$. Just above the N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$, a field of 13 T increases $\kappa_{xx}$ by a factor $\sim 211$, much larger than reported previously in any magnetic insulator. Interestingly, $\kappa_{xx}(H,T)$ exhibits a scaling behavior in the entire magnetically disordered region that surrounds the ordered zigzag state. The ratio $\Delta \kappa_{xx}(H,T)/\kappa_{xx}(13,T)$, measured throughout the disordered region, collapses to a one-parameter scaling function ${\rm exp}(-1/gx)$ (where $x = \mu_{\rm B}B/k_{\rm B}T$ and $g$ is a constant).</description>

      <title>Theory of excitonic order in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that kagome metals can feature an excitonic condensate of unconventional nature. Studying the recently discovered variant ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, we identify electron and hole pockets due to a pair of van Hove singularities (vHS) close to the Fermi level, with an approximate spectral particle-hole symmetry at low energies. A significant fraction of the Fermi level density of states away from the vHS is removed by the onset of high temperature charge density wave order, and makes the bands more two dimensional, setting the stage for the formation of excitons. We develop a two-orbital minimal model which captures these features, along with the sublattice support of the wavefunctions, and find $s$-wave or $d$-wave excitons depending on the microscopic interaction parameters -- the latter of which exhibits either a charge nematic or time-reversal symmetry breaking flux order depending on strain, offering an explanation of recent STM and transport experiments. The appearance of particle-type and hole-type vHS, and the excitonic resonance associated with it, may be a common thread to understanding nematicity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Properties of an organic model $S=1$ Haldane chain system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the properties of a new organic $S=1$ chain system $m$-NO$_2$PhBNO (abbreviated BoNO). In this biradical system two unpaired electrons from aminoxyl groups are strongly ferromagnetically coupled ($|J_\text{FM}| \gtrsim 500$ K) which leads to the formation of an effective $S=1$ state for each molecule. The chains of BoNO diradicals propagate along the crystallographic $a$ axis. Temperature dependence of the $g$ factor and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) linewidth are consistent with a low-dimensional system with antiferromagnetic interactions. The EPR data further suggest that BoNO is the first known Haldane system with an almost isotropic $g$ factor ($2.0023 \pm 2 \unicode{x2030}$). The magnetization measurements in magnetic fields up to $40$ T and low-field susceptibility, together with $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, reveal a dominant intrachain antiferromagnetic exchange coupling of $J_\text{1D} = (11.3\pm0.1)$ K, and attainable critical magnetic fields of $\mu_0 H_\text{c1} \approx 2$ T and $\mu_0 H_\text{c2} \approx 33$ T. These measurements therefore suggest that BoNO is a unique Haldane system with extremely small magnetic anisotropy. Present results are crucial for a future in-depth NMR study of the low-temperature Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) and magnetic field-induced phases, which can be performed in the entire phase space.</description>

      <title>Crystalline electric field excitations and their nonlinear splitting under magnetic fields in YbOCl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently reported van der Waals layered honeycomb rare-earth chalcohalides REChX (RE = rare earth, Ch = chalcogen, and X = halogen) are considered to be promising Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) candidates. The high-quality single crystals of YbOCl, a representative member of the family with an effective spin of 1/2, are available now. The crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations in a rare-earth spin system are fundamentally important for understanding both finite-temperature and ground-state magnetism, but remain unexplored in YbOCl so far. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive Raman scattering study to unambiguously identify the CEF excitations in YbOCl and determine the CEF parameters and wave functions. Our Raman experiments further reveal the anomalous nonlinear CEF splitting under magnetic fields. We have grown single crystals of YbOCl, the nonmagnetic LuOCl, and the diluted magnetic Lu_{0.86}Yb_{0.14}OCl to make a completely comparative investigation. Polarized Raman spectra on the samples at 1.8 K allow us to clearly assign all the Raman-active phonon modes and explicitly identify the CEF excitations in YbOCl. The CEF excitations are further examined using temperature-dependent Raman measurements and careful symmetry analysis based on Raman tensors related to CEF excitations. By applying the CEF Hamiltonian to the experimentally determined CEF excitations, we extract the CEF parameters and eventually determine the CEF wave functions. The study experimentally pins down the CEF excitations in the Kitaev compound YbOCl and sets a foundation for understanding its finite-temperature magnetism and exploring the possible nontrivial spin ground state.</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene has emerged as a key platform for non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, exhibiting multiple half-filled plateaus with large energy gaps. Here, we report four unexpected quarter-filled states and complete the sequence of half-filled plateaus by observing the previously missing $\nu=-\frac{3}{2}$ and $\nu=\frac{1}{2}$ states. Identifying the half-filled plateaus according to their Levin--Halperin daughter states, we reveal an alternating pattern of non-Abelian topological orders. Whenever a pair of $N=1$ Landau levels cross, anti-Pfaffian and Pfaffian develop in the lower and higher levels, respectively. Surprisingly, quarter states occur in $N=0$ levels and are also accompanied by daughters. The mutual exclusion of half- and quarter-filled states indicates a robust competition between the interactions favoring paired states of either two-flux or four-flux composite fermions. Finally, we observe several FQH states that require strong interactions between composite fermions. The systematic pattern of non-Abelian states across two generations of even denominators strengthens the identification of their topological orders and suggests a universal origin.</description>

Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>
