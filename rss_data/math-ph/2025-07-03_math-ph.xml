      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Nonreciprocal Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional disordered block subwavelength resonator systems subject to nonreciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Limits of Decoding: Critical Divergence of Kullback-Leibler Information and Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical mechanical framework based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to analyze the relativistic limits of decoding time-encoded information from a moving source. By modeling the symbol durations as entropy-maximizing sequences and treating the decoding process as context-sensitive inference, we identify KLD between the sender and receiver distributions as a key indicator of contextual mismatch. We show that, under Lorentz transformations, this divergence grows with the sender's velocity and exhibits critical divergence as the velocity approaches the speed of light. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the Fisher information and demonstrate that decoding sensitivity diverges similarly, indicating instability near the relativistic limit. By introducing an information-theoretic free energy based on the decoding cost, we determine a critical velocity beyond which decoding becomes thermodynamically impossible. These results reveal a phase-transition-like behavior in relativistic information transfer and provide a unified interpretation of KLD, Fisher information, and free energy as measures of decodability. The formalism developed here offers new insights into high-speed communication, relativistic signal processing, and information geometry in non-inertial frames.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problem for the localized wave propagation in continuous model of the one-dimensional diatomic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the continuous model of the localized wave propagation corresponding to the one-dimensional diatomic crystal lattice. From the mathematical point of view the problem can be described in terms of the Cauchy problem with localized initial data for a system of two pseudo-differential equations. We assume two small parameters in this formulation -- the lattice step and the size if the initial perturbation. We construct the asymptotic solution of the continuous Cauchy problem with respect to the size of perturbation.
  The ratio of the small parameters drastically affects the form of the solution. We consider two situations -- when the size of the perturbation is sufficiently large and when it is comparable with the lattice step. In each situations we provide analytical formulae for the asymptotic solution via Airy function.</description>

      <title>Inclined flow of a second-gradient incompressible fluid with pressure-dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many viscous liquids behave effectively as incompressible under high pressures but display a pronounced dependence of viscosity on pressure. The classical incompressible Navier-Stokes model cannot account for both features, and a simple pressure-dependent modification introduces questions about the well-posedness of the resulting equations. This paper presents the first study of a second-gradient extension of the incompressible Navier-Stokes model, recently introduced by the authors, which includes higher-order spatial derivatives, pressure-sensitive viscosities, and complementary boundary conditions. Focusing on steady flow down an inclined plane, we adopt Barus' exponential law and impose weak adherence at the lower boundary and a prescribed ambient pressure at the free surface. Through numerical simulations, we examine how the flow profile varies with the angle of inclination, ambient pressure, viscosity sensitivity to pressure, and internal length scale.</description>

      <title>Adjusting Higher Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in formulating higher Chern-Simons theories is the construction of a consistent higher gauge theory that circumvents the fake-flatness constraint. Here, we propose a solution to this problem using adjusted higher connections. In particular, we shall demonstrate that there is an obstruction to constructing such action functionals since, generically, adjusted higher gauge algebras do not admit an inner product. To overcome this obstruction, we introduce half-adjusted higher Chern-Simons theories. These theories have both well-defined underlying kinematic data as well as the expected properties of a higher generalisation of Chern-Simons theory. We develop the general construction of these theories in arbitrary dimensions and provide explicit details for the four-dimensional case. We also present the complete differential cohomological framework for principal 2-bundles with half-adjusted connections. Finally, we discuss an alternative approach introducing additional trivial symmetries.</description>

      <title>Traveling Wave Solutions to a Large Class of Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier (BNSF) system, introduced by Howard Brenner, was developed to address some deficiencies in the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, based on the concept of volume velocity. We consider the one-dimensional BNSF system in Lagrangian mass coordinates, incorporating temperature-dependent transport coefficients, which yields a more physically realistic framework. We establish the existence and uniqueness of monotone traveling wave solutions (or viscous shocks) to the BNSF system with any positive $C^2$ dissipation coefficients, provided that the shock amplitude is sufficiently small. We utilize geometric singular perturbation theory as in the constant coefficient case [13]; however, due to the arbitrary nonlinearities of the coefficients, we employ the implicit function theorem, which grants robustness to our approach. This work is motivated by [12], which proves a contraction property of any large solutions to the BNSF system around the traveling wave solutions. Thus, we also derive some quantitative estimates on the traveling wave solutions that play a fundamental role in [12].</description>

      <title>Newman-Penrose-like exact and approximate conservation laws: a covariant and conformal formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a conformal extension of the Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalism I derive a manifestly covariant and conformal expression of Newman-Penrose (NP) constants, which are a set of conserved quantities associated to solutions to the wave equation on light cones in Minkowski space. The resulting expression generalizes to massless fields of arbitrary spin -- including the electromagnetic field, Weyl fermions, and the linearized Weyl tensor -- on conformally flat space-times. In some non-conformally flat space-times there may exist conserved charges on very special null hypersurfaces. Using the conformal GHP formalism I prove the existence of conserved Aretakis charges on extremal Killing horizons. In the absence of exact conservation laws it is still useful to extend the definition for NP constants to some asymptotically flat curved space-times, where the conservation laws become approximate conservation laws which rapidly approach exact conservation laws at null infinity. I derive explicit expressions for spherically symmetric space-times.</description>

      <title>Quasi-triangular and factorizable dendriform D-bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of quasi-triangular and factorizable dendriform D-bialgebras. A factorizable dendriform D-bialgebra leads to a factorization of the underlying dendriform algebra. We show that the dendriform double of a dendriform D-bialgebra naturally enjoys a factorizable dendriform D-bialgebra structure. Moreover, we introduce the notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weights on dendriform algebras and find that every quasi-triangular dendriform D-bialgebra can give rise to a relative Rota-Baxter operator of weight 1. Then we introduce the notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter dendriform algebras as the Rota-Baxter characterization of factorizable dendriform D-bialgebras, and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between factorizable dendriform D-bialgebras and quadratic Rota-Baxter dendriform algebras. Finally, we show that a quadratic Rota-Baxter dendriform algebra can give rise to an isomorphism from the regular representation to the coregular representation of a Rota-Baxter dendriform algebra.</description>

      <title>A generalized Birman-Schwinger principle and applications to one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a self-adjoint operator $H_0$ bounded from below in a complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, the corresponding scale of spaces $\mathcal{H}_{+1}(H_0) \subset \mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{H}_{-1}(H_0) = [\mathcal{H}_{+1}(H_0)]^*$, and a fixed $V\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_{+1}(H_0),\mathcal{H}_{-1}(H_0))$, we define the operator-valued map $A_V(\,\cdot\,):\rho(H_0)\to \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ by \[ A_V(z):=-\big(H_0-zI_{\mathcal{H}} \big)^{-1/2}V\big(H_0-zI_{\mathcal{H}} \big)^{-1/2}\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}),\quad z\in \rho(H_0), \] where $\rho(H_0)$ denotes the resolvent set of $H_0$. Assuming that $A_V(z)$ is compact for some $z=z_0\in \rho(H_0)$ and has norm strictly less than one for some $z=E_0\in (-\infty,0)$, we employ an abstract version of Tiktopoulos' formula to define an operator $H$ in $\mathcal{H}$ that is formally realized as the sum of $H_0$ and $V$. We then establish a Birman-Schwinger principle for $H$ in which $A_V(\,\cdot\,)$ plays the role of the Birman-Schwinger operator: $\lambda_0\in \rho(H_0)$ is an eigenvalue of $H$ if and only if $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A_V(\lambda_0)$. Furthermore, the geometric (but not necessarily the algebraic) multiplicities of $\lambda_0$ and $1$ as eigenvalues of $H$ and $A_V(\lambda_0)$, respectively, coincide.
  As a concrete application, we consider one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R})$ distributional potentials.</description>

      <title>Trapping by repulsion: the NLS with a delta-prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence and provide explicit expressions for the stationary states of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with a repulsive delta-prime potential and a focusing nonlinearity of power type. Furthermore, we prove that, if the nonlinearity is subcritical, then ground states exist for any strength of the delta-prime interaction and for every positive value of the mass.
  This result supplies an example of ground states arising from a repulsive potential, a counterintuitive phenomenon explained by the emergence of an additional dimension in the energy space, induced by the delta-prime interaction. This new dimension contains states of lower energy and is thus responsible for the existence of nonlinear ground states that do not originate from linear eigenfunctions.
  The explicit form of the ground states is derived by addressing the ancillary problem of minimizing the action functional on the Nehari manifold. We solve such problem in the subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes.</description>

      <title>One application of Duistermaat-Heckman measure in quantum information theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the exact separability probability of 8/33 for two-qubit states under the Hilbert-Schmidt measure has been reported by Huong and Khoi [\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad8493}{J.Phys.A:Math.Theor.{\bf57}, 445304(2024)}], detailed derivations remain inaccessible for general audiences. This paper provides a comprehensive, self-contained derivation of this result, elucidating the underlying geometric and probabilistic structures. We achieve this by developing a framework centered on the computation of Hilbert-Schmidt volumes for key components: the quantum state space, relevant flag manifolds, and regular (co)adjoint orbits. Crucially, we establish and leverage the connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability probability. Our approach offers a transparent pathway to this fundamental constant, detailing the interplay between symplectic geometry, representation theory, and quantum probability.</description>

      <title>Fast reconstruction approaches for photoacoustic tomography with smoothing Sobolev/Mat\'ern priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), the computation of the initial pressure distribution within an object from its time-dependent boundary measurements over time is considered. This problem can be approached from two well-established points of view: deterministically using regularisation methods, or stochastically using the Bayesian framework. Both approaches frequently require the solution of a variational problem. In the paper we elaborate the connection between these approaches by establishing the equivalence between a smoothing Mat{\'e}rn class of covariance operators and Sobolev embedding operator $E_s: H^s \hookrightarrow L^2$. We further discuss the use of a Wavelet-based implementation of the adjoint operator $E_s^*$ which also allows for efficient evaluations for certain Mat{\'e}rn covariance operators, leading to efficient implementations both in terms of computational effort as well as memory requirements. The proposed methods are validated with reconstructions for the photoacoustic problem.</description>

      <title>Random Flights and Anomalous Diffusion: A Non-Markovian Take on Lorentz Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Lorentz processes in two different settings. Both cases are characterized by infinite expectation of the free-flight times, contrary to what happens in the classical Gallavotti-Spohn models. Under a suitable Boltzmann-Grad type scaling limit, they converge to non-Markovian random-flight processes with superdiffusive behavior. A further scaling limit yields another non Markovian process, i.e., a superdiffusion obtained by a suitable time-change of Brownian motion. Furthermore, we obtain the governing equations for our random flights and anomalous diffusion, which represent a non-local counterpart for the linear-Boltzmann and diffusion equations arising in the classical theory. It turns out that these equations have the form of fractional kinetic equations in both time and space. To prove these results, we develop a technique based on mixtures of Feller semigroups.</description>

Abstract: We present a classification of homogeneous star products on duals of Lie algebroids in terms of the second Lie algebroid cohomology. Moreover, we extend this classification to projectable star products, i.e., to quantizations compatible with (coisotropic) reduction. This implies that quantization commutes with reduction in the considered setting.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for a tumor growth model with obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an existence and regularity theory for solutions to a geometric free boundary problem motivated by models of tumor growth. In this setting, the tumor invades an accessible region $D$, its motion is directed along a constant vector $V$, and it cannot penetrate another region $K$ acting as an obstacle to the spread of the tumor. Due to the non variational structure of the problem, we show existence of viscosity solutions via Perron's method. Subsequently, we prove interior regularity for the free boundary near regular points by means of an improvement of flatness argument. We further analyze the boundary regularity and we prove that the free boundary meets the obstacle as a $C^{1,\alpha}$ graph. A key step in the analysis of the boundary regularity involves the study of a thin obstacle problem with oblique boundary conditions, for which we establish $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Hamiltonians in Fermionic Fock Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11697v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic Hamiltonians are important in quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics. Their general studies, which go back to the sixties, are relatively incomplete for the fermionic case studied here. Following Berezin, they are quadratic in the fermionic field and in this way well-defined self-adjoint operators acting on the fermionic Fock space. We analyze their diagonalization by applying a novel elliptic operator-valued differential equations studied in a companion paper. This allows for their ($\mathrm{N}$-) diagonalization under much weaker assumptions than before. Last but not least, in 1994 Bach, Lieb and Solovej defined them to be generators of strongly continuous unitary groups of Bogoliubov transformations. This is shown to be an equivalent definition, as soon as the vacuum state belongs to the domain of definition of these Hamiltonians. This second outcome is demonstrated to be reminiscent to the celebrated Shale-Stinespring condition on Bogoliubov transformations.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'e transcendents in the defocusing mKdV equation with non-zero boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation with non-zero boundary conditions \begin{align}
  &amp;q_t(x,t)-6q^2(x,t)q_{x}(x,t)+q_{xxx}(x,t)=0, \nonumber
  &amp;q(x,0)=q_{0}(x)\to \pm 1, \ \ x\rightarrow\pm\infty, \nonumber \end{align} which can be characterized using a Riemann-Hilbert problem through the inverse scattering transform. Using the $\bar\partial$-generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent approach, combined with the double scaling limit technique, we obtain the long-time asymptotics of the solution of the Cauchy problem for the defocusing mKdV equation in the transition region $|x/t+6|t^{2/3}&lt; C$ with $C&gt;0$. The asymptotics can be expressed in terms of the solution of the second Painlev\'{e} transcendent.</description>

      <title>On the effective dynamics of Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we describe the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a degenerate Fermi gas, at zero temperature. First, we analyze the mean-field approximation of the many-body Schr\"odinger dynamics and prove emergence of a coupled Hartree-type system of equations. We obtain rigorous error control that yields a non-trivial scaling window in which the approximation is meaningful. Second, starting from this Hartree system, we identify a novel scaling regime in which the fermion distribution behaves semi-clasically, but the boson field remains quantum-mechanical; this is one of the main contributions of the present article. In this regime, the bosons are much lighter and more numerous than the fermions. We then prove convergence to a coupled Vlasov-Hartee system of equations with an explicit convergence rate.</description>

Abstract: We give a complete classification of the anyon sectors of Kitaev's quantum double model on the infinite triangular lattice and for finite gauge group $G$, including the non-abelian case. As conjectured, the anyon sectors of the model correspond precisely to equivalence classes of irreducible representations of the quantum double algebra of $G$.</description>

      <title>A Lee-Huang-Yang type expansion for the thermodynamic energy density of a dilute mixture of Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dilute gas in 3D composed of two species of bosons interacting through positive inter-species and intra-species pairwise potentials. We prove a second order expansion for the energy density in the thermodynamic limit. For the case of compactly supported, integrable potentials, we derive the correct second order of the expansion. If we make the further assumption of having soft potentials, we also derive the correct coefficient of the second order and the resulting formula is coherent with the physics literature. If we let the density and scattering length of one of the species go to zero, we obtain the Lee-Huang-Yang formula for one species of bosons. The paper also contains a proof of BEC for a mixture of bosons in a box with length scale larger than the Gross-Pitaevskii one.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Superintegrability from Unitary Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some eigenvalue matrix models possess an interesting property: one can manifestly define the basis where all averages can be explicitly calculated. For example, in the Gaussian Hermitian and rectangular complex models, averages of the Schur functions are again expressed through the Schur functions. However, so far this property remains restricted to very particular (e.g. Gaussian) measures. In this paper, we extend this observation to unitary matrix integrals, where one could expect that this restriction is easier to lift. We demonstrate that this is indeed the case, only this time the Schur averages are linear combinations of the Schur functions. Full factorization to a single item in the sum appears only on the Miwa locus, where at least one half of the time-variables is expressed through matrices of the same size. For unitary integrals, this is a manifestation of the de Wit-t'Hooft anomaly, which prevents the answer to be fully analytic in the matrix size $N$. Once achieved, this understanding can be extended back to the Hermitian model, where the phenomenon looks very similar: beyond Gaussian measures superintegrability requires an additional summation.</description>

      <title>Connecting topological strings and spectral theory via non-autonomous Toda equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Topological String/Spectral theory duality on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from the resolution of the cone over the $Y^{N,0}$ singularity. Assuming Kyiv formula, we demonstrate this duality in a special regime thanks to an underlying connection between spectral determinants of quantum mirror curves and the non-autonomous (q)-Toda system. We further exploit this link to connect small and large time expansions in Toda equations. In particular we provide an explicit expression for their tau functions at large time in terms of a strong coupling version of irregular $W_N$ conformal blocks at $c=N-1$. These are related to a special class of multi-cut matrix models which describe the strong coupling regime of four dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>Casimir Radial Parts via Matsuki Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Matsuki's decomposition for symmetric pairs $(G, H)$ of (not necessarily compact) reductive Lie groups to construct the radial parts for invariant differential operators acting on matrix-spherical functions. As an application, we employ this machinery to formulate an alternative, mathematically rigorous approach to obtaining radial parts of Casimir operators that appear in the theory of conformal blocks, which avoids poorly defined analytical continuations from the compact quotient cases. To exemplify how this works, after reviewing the presentation of conformal 4-point correlation functions via matrix-spherical functions for the corresponding symmetric pair, we for the first time provide a complete analysis of the Casimir radial part decomposition in the case of Lorentzian signature. As another example, we revisit the Casimir reduction in the case of conformal blocks for two scalar defects of equal dimension. We argue that Matsuki's decomposition thus provides a proper mathematical framework for analysing the correspondence between Casimir equations and the Calogero-Sutherland-type models, first discovered by one of the authors and Schomerus.</description>

      <title>Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the so-called group geometric approach to (super)gravity and (super)string theories, any compact Lie group manifold $G_{c}$ can be smoothly deformed into a group manifold $G_{c}^{\mu }$ (locally diffeomorphic to $G_{c}$ itself), which is `soft', namely, based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein $\mu $, which violates the Maurer-Cartan equations and consequently has a non-vanishing associated curvature two-form. Within the framework based on the above deformation (`softening'), we show how to construct an infinite-dimensional (infinite-rank), generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to $G_{c}$. As an application, we consider KM algebras associated to deformed manifolds such as the `soft' circle, the `soft' two-sphere and the `soft' three-sphere. While the generalized KM algebra associated to the deformed circle is trivially isomorphic to its undeformed analogue, and hence not new, the `softening' of the two- and three- sphere includes squashed manifolds (and in particular, the so-called Berger three-sphere) and yields to non-trivial results.</description>

      <title>A switching identity for cable-graph loop soups and Gaussian free fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a "switching identity" that can be stated for critical Brownian loop-soups or for the Gaussian free field on a cable graph: It basically says that at the level of cluster configurations and at the more general level of the occupation time fields, conditioning two points on the cable-graph to belong to the same cluster of Brownian loops (or equivalently to the same sign-cluster of the GFF) amounts to adding a random odd number of independent Brownian excursions between these points to an otherwise unconditioned configuration. This explicit simple description of the conditional law of the clusters when a connection occurs has various direct consequences, in particular about the large scale behaviour of these sign-clusters on infinite graphs.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Symmetry as a Source of Algebraic Cycles: Non-Constructive Methods for the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical variational Hodge structure theory characterizes the algebraicity of Hodge classes by studying the transversality of period mappings under geometric deformations. However, when algebraic varieties lack appropriate deformation families, this method faces applicability limitations. This paper develops a non-constructive method based on exceptional Lie group constraints to handle such cases. Our main technical contribution is establishing a dimension control mechanism for Spencer cohomology theory under Lie group constraints. Specifically, we prove that when a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ is equipped with $E_7$ group constraints, the corresponding Spencer kernel $\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1}$ has complex dimension simultaneously constrained by two bounds: representation theory gives the lower bound $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} \geq 56$, while the degenerate Spencer-de Rham mapping gives the upper bound $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} \leq h^{1,1}(X)$. For 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds satisfying $h^{1,1}(X) = 56$, this dimension constraint becomes the equality $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} = 56 = h^{1,1}(X)$. Combined with our established Spencer-calibration equivalence principle, this dimension matching result is sufficient to verify the $(1,1)$-type Hodge conjecture. Our proof completely avoids explicit algebraic cycle construction, instead achieving the goal through abstract dimensional arguments. This method demonstrates the application potential of Lie group representation theory in algebraic geometry, providing new theoretical tools for handling geometric objects where traditional deformation methods are not applicable.</description>
