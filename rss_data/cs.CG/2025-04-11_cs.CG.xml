      <title>Convexity Helps Iterated Search in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the classical fractional cascading technique, we introduce new techniques to speed up the following type of iterated search in 3D: The input is a graph $\mathbf{G}$ with bounded degree together with a set $H_v$ of 3D hyperplanes associated with every vertex of $v$ of $\mathbf{G}$. The goal is to store the input such that given a query point $q\in \mathbb{R}^3$ and a connected subgraph $\mathbf{H}\subset \mathbf{G}$, we can decide if $q$ is below or above the lower envelope of $H_v$ for every $v\in \mathbf{H}$. We show that using linear space, it is possible to answer queries in roughly $O(\log n + |\mathbf{H}|\sqrt{\log n})$ time which improves trivial bound of $O(|\mathbf{H}|\log n)$ obtained by using planar point location data structures. Our data structure can in fact answer more general queries (it combines with shallow cuttings) and it even works when $\mathbf{H}$ is given one vertex at a time. We show that this has a number of new applications and in particular, we give improved solutions to a set of natural data structure problems that up to our knowledge had not seen any improvements.
  We believe this is a very surprising result because obtaining similar results for the planar point location problem was known to be impossible.</description>

      <title>Bregman-Hausdorff divergence: strengthening the connections between computational geometry and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. On a technical side, we propose an extension of the Hausdorff distance from metric spaces to spaces equipped with asymmetric distance measures. Specifically, we focus on the family of Bregman divergences, which includes the popular Kullback--Leibler divergence (also known as relative entropy).
  As a proof of concept, we use the resulting Bregman--Hausdorff divergence to compare two collections of probabilistic predictions produced by different machine learning models trained using the relative entropy loss. The algorithms we propose are surprisingly efficient even for large inputs with hundreds of dimensions.
  In addition to the introduction of this technical concept, we provide a survey. It outlines the basics of Bregman geometry, as well as computational geometry algorithms. We focus on algorithms that are compatible with this geometry and are relevant for machine learning.</description>

      <title>Incremental Planar Nearest Neighbor Queries with Optimal Query Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that two-dimensional nearest neighbor queries can be answered in optimal $O(\log n)$ time while supporting insertions in $O(\log^{1+\varepsilon}n)$ time. No previous data structure was known that supports $O(\log n)$-time queries and polylog-time insertions. In order to achieve logarithmic queries our data structure uses a new technique related to fractional cascading that leverages the inherent geometry of this problem. Our method can be also used in other semi-dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Linear relations between face numbers of levels in arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study linear relations between face numbers of levels in arrangements. Let $V = \{ v_1, \ldots, v_n \} \subset \mathbf{R}^{r}$ be a vector configuration in general position, and let $\mathcal{A}(V)$ be polar dual arrangement of hemispheres in the $d$-dimensional unit sphere $S^d$, where $d=r-1$. For $0\leq s \leq d$ and $0 \leq t \leq n$, let $f_{s,t}(V)$ denote the number of faces of \emph{level} $t$ and dimension $d-s$ in the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(V)$ (these correspond to partitions $V=V_-\sqcup V_0 \sqcup V_+$ by linear hyperplanes with $|V_0|=s$ and $|V_-|=t$). We call the matrix $f(V):=[f_{s,t}(V)]$ the \emph{$f$-matrix} of $V$.
  Completing a long line of research on linear relations between face numbers of levels in arrangements, we determine, for every $n\geq r \geq 1$, the affine space $\mathfrak{F}_{n,r}$ spanned by the $f$-matrices of configurations of $n$ vectors in general position in $\mathbf{R}^r$; moreover, we determine the subspace $\mathfrak{F}^0_{n,r} \subset \mathfrak{F}_{n,r}$ spanned by all \emph{pointed} vector configurations (i.e., such that $V$ is contained in some open linear halfspace), which correspond to point sets in $\mathbf{R}^d$. This generalizes the classical fact that the Dehn--Sommerville relations generate all linear relations between the face numbers of simple polytopes (the faces at level $0$) and answers a question posed by Andrzejak and Welzl in 2003.
  The key notion for the statements and the proofs of our results is the $g$-matrix of a vector configuration, which determines the $f$-matrix and generalizes the classical $g$-vector of a polytope.
  By Gale duality, we also obtain analogous results for partitions of vector configurations by sign patterns of nontrivial linear dependencies, and for \emph{Radon partitions} of point sets in $\mathbf{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Sublevels in arrangements and the spherical arc crossing number of complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levels and sublevels in arrangements -- and, dually, $k$-sets and $(\leq k)$-sets -- are fundamental notions in discrete and computational geometry and natural generalizations of convex polytopes, which correspond to the $0$-level. A long-standing conjecture of Eckhoff, Linhart, and Welzl, which would generalize McMullen's Upper Bound Theorem for polytopes and provide an exact refinement of asymptotic bounds by Clarkson, asserts that for all $k\leq \lfloor \frac{n-d-2}{2}\rfloor$, the number of $(\leq k)$-sets of a set $S$ of $n$ points in $\mathbf{R}^d$ is maximized if $S$ is the vertex set of a neighborly polytope.
  As a new tool for studying this conjecture and related problems, we introduce the $g$-matrix, which generalizes both the $g$-vector of a simple polytope and a Gale dual version of the $g$-vector studied by Lee and Welzl. Our main result is that the $g$-matrix of every vector configuration in $\mathbf{R}^3$ is non-negative, which implies the Eckhoff--Linhart--Welzl conjecture in the case where $d=n-4$.
  As a corollary, we obtain the following result about crossing numbers: Consider a configuration $V\subset S^2 \subset \mathbf{R}^3$ of $n$ unit vectors, and connect every pair of vectors by the unique shortest geodesic arc between them in the unit sphere $S^2$. This yields a drawing of the complete graph $K_n$ in $S^2$, which we call a spherical arc drawing. Complementing previous results for rectilinear drawings, we show that the number of crossings in any spherical arc drawing of $K_n$ is at least $\frac{1}{4}\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor \lfloor \frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor \lfloor \frac{n-2}{2}\rfloor \lfloor \frac{n-3}{2}\rfloor$, which equals the conjectured value of the crossing number of $K_n$. Moreover, the lower bound is attained if $V$ is coneighborly, i.e., if every open linear halfspace contains at least $\lfloor (n-2)/2 \rfloor$ of the vectors in $V$.</description>

      <title>The Point-Boundary Art Gallery Problem is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve the complexity of the point-boundary variant of the art gallery problem, showing that it is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete, meaning that it is equivalent under polynomial time reductions to deciding whether a system of polynomial equations has a real solution. The art gallery problem asks whether there is a configuration of {\it guards} that together can see every point inside of an {\it art gallery} modeled by a simple polygon. The original version of this problem (which we call the point-point variant) was shown to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-hard [Abrahamsen, Adamaszek, and Miltzow, JACM 2021], but the complexity of the variant where guards only need to guard the walls of the art gallery was left as an open problem. We show that this variant is also $\exists\mathbb{R}$-hard. Our techniques can also be used to greatly simplify the proof of $\exists\mathbb{R}$-hardness of the point-point art gallery problem. The gadgets in previous work could only be constructed by using a computer to find complicated rational coordinates with specific algebraic properties. All of our gadgets can be constructed by hand and can be verified with simple geometric arguments.</description>

      <title>Recognizing 2-Layer and Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crossing number of a graph is the least number of crossings over all drawings of the graph in the plane. Computing the crossing number of a given graph is NP-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the natural parameter. Two well-known variants of the problem are 2-layer crossing minimization and circular crossing minimization, where every vertex must lie on one of two layers, namely two parallel lines, or a circle, respectively. Both variants are NP-hard, but FPT with respect to the natural parameter.
  Recently, a local version of the crossing number has also received considerable attention. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. In contrast to the crossing number, recognizing $k$-planar graphs is NP-hard even if $k=1$.
  In this paper, we consider the two above variants in the local setting. The $k$-planar graphs that admit a straight-line drawing with vertices on two layers or on a circle are called 2-layer $k$-planar and outer $k$-planar graphs, respectively. We study the parameterized complexity of the two recognition problems with respect to $k$. For $k=0$, both problems can easily be solved in linear time. Two groups independently showed that outer 1-planar graphs can also be recognized in linear time [Hong et al., Algorithmica 2015; Auer et al., Algorithmica 2016]. One group asked whether outer 2-planar graphs can be recognized in polynomial time.
  Our main contribution consists of XP-algorithms for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs and outer $k$-planar graphs. We complement these results by showing that both recognition problems are XNLP-hard. This implies that both problems are W$[t]$-hard for every $t$ and that it is unlikely that they admit FPT-algorithms. On the other hand, we present an FPT-algorithm for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs where the order of the vertices on one layer is specified.</description>
