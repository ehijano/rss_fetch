      <title>De Sitter corrections to supertranslation Ward identity and soft graviton theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tree-level scattering of massless scalars followed by an emission of a soft graviton in the small compact region inside the static patch in de Sitter space. We derive in the small cosmological constant limit the perturbative corrections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem. Exploiting the remarkable relationship between asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems in flat space, we derive perturbative corrections to the supertranslation Ward identity. We further show that the derived supertranslation Ward identity reduces to the perturbative soft graviton theorem for the same choice of the supertranslation parameter as in flat space.</description>

      <title>The Non-Planar Four-Point Integrand and Konishi Dimension in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory at Five Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the complete non-planar integrand for the correlation function of four lightest scalar operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at five-loop order. This is equivalent to the super-correlator of nine stress-tensor multiplets in the self-dual theory. Starting with an ansatz of f-graphs, we impose constraints from light-cone limits, and fix the remaining freedom by using the reformulation of the theory in twistor space. We develop an efficient GPU-based algorithm for the numerical evaluation of the twistor rules. As an application, we extract the five-loop non-planar anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator. Our code and result are provided in ancillary files.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Weak Gravity Conjecture in AdS Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the extension of our recent proposal for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in AdS space to more general effective field theories. We first extend the conjecture to set-ups where moduli are present and we demand that a particle, produced during the decay of an extremal black hole via the Schwinger effect, is repelled close to the horizon of the black hole. We interpret this condition as the universal criterion imposed by the WGC for any background. Interestingly, the constraint imposed by the WGC on the particle spectrum, before the stabilization of the moduli, is independent of the background, resulting in the same bound both in Minkowski and in AdS space. For the case of AdS space, after the stabilization of the moduli, the WGC in AdS space is reproduced due to the formation of a non-singular horizon of the extremal black hole. In that case, the particle spectrum must satisfy the stronger of the two WGC conditions obtained before and after moduli stabilization. Finally, we use these results to argue that a similar version of the tower WGC should also apply to an AdS background.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the DHR theorem for higher form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) reconstruction theorem shows that standard ($0$-form) internal symmetries are associated to groups in relativistic quantum field theory in spacetime dimension $D&gt;2$. In particular, non-invertible symmetry structures in $D&gt;2$ correspond to the choice of a subtheory of a unique parent one, where the symmetry is a compact group. We present a theorem that generalizes this result to higher form symmetries. We first re-formulate the DHR theorem in terms of Haag duality violations (HDV) for regions with non-trivial homotopy group $\pi_0$ in the finite index case. In this light, the theorem states that the category associated with such HDV is the dual of a group, and it can be extended to spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios. Then, after eliminating $\pi_0$ sectors via DHR reconstruction, we show that the HDV corresponding to regions with non-trivial $\pi_i$, $0&lt;i&lt;D-2$, are associated with abelian groups. Physically, the result shows that generalized order/disorder parameters in $D&gt;2$ are labeled by such groups, in agreement with the case of confinement order parameters in Yang-Mills theories (Wilson and 't Hooft loops). For the special case of $D=4n$ and loops of dimension $k=2 n-1$, the group is further required to have a Hermitian character table. This does not rule out the possibility of an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor that is not achievable by Lagrangian gauge models. In the way we find a new proof of the group-like origin of internal symmetries, and analyze the sectors for more general regions, e.g., direct sums, knots, and links. In particular, we find that generalized knot order parameters are classified by the unknot order parameters, and the commutator of knot non-local operators is determined by the linking number.</description>

      <title>ADE Minimal Strings and Multi-Matrix Duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit ADE minimal string theories, focusing on the D- and E-series minimal models coupled to Liouville theory. Unlike the A-series, whose duals are solvable two-matrix models, these theories are conjectured to correspond to unsolvable four-matrix integrals. We compute sphere four-point and torus one-point amplitudes in the AMS, DMS, and EMS via direct numerical integration over moduli space, confirming/disproving some known results and providing new data where matrix-model predictions are unavailable. From amplitudes with conformal boundaries, we find evidence for multi-matrix structure in the D-series, including scaled ramp behavior in cylinder diagrams and deviations from the ZZ-instanton sector of two-matrix models. We also perform a preliminary positivity bootstrap to constrain critical points of the multi-matrix models relevant to the DMS string.</description>

      <title>Algebras for generalized entanglement wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In asymptotically AdS spacetimes, the mathematical structure of the set of entanglement wedges reflects the algebraic structure of the underlying holographic description. For more general spacetimes, Bousso and Penington (BP) have recently proposed a generalization of entanglement wedges sharing many of the same properties as usual entanglement wedges. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that each generalized entanglement wedge can be associated with an algebra in the (generally unknown) fundamental description (in a semiclassical limit). We postulate features of the map from entanglement wedges to algebras that provide a natural algebraic interpretation for some of the basic mathematical properties of the set of entanglement wedges. Quantitatively, we suggest a possible generalization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula that associates the gravitational entropy of a generalized entanglement wedge with an entropic quantity for the associated algebra. Through this assignment, inclusion monotonicity and strong-subadditivity properties shown by BP for generalized entanglement wedges would follow from various inequalities satisfied by algebraic entropies. We include a detailed appendix reviewing relevant algebraic background, including a discussion of algebraic entropies and their inequalities.</description>

      <title>Zoo of Correlation Inequalities in Holography and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study information-theoretic inequalities for holographic correlation measures $J_W$ and $D_W$, establishing rigorous topological frameworks that prove monotonicity, monogamy, and strong superadditivity. While earlier work proposed bulk duals of classical correlation and quantum discord, their information-theoretic properties were unclear. We derive multiple inequalities involving entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and show that monotonicity holds for both measured and unmeasured parties in $J_W$ and for the unmeasured party in $D_W$. Unlike their original counterparts, we find that $J_W$ is monogamous for both parties and obeys one-way strong superadditivity, whereas $D_W$ is polygamous for the unmeasured party in pure tripartite states. These results highlight distinctive features of holographic states and support a conjectured duality between $J_W$ and distillable entanglement. Motivated by the relation between EWCS and reflected entropy, we introduce boundary analogues $J_R$ and $D_R$, which serve as computable proxies for classical and quantum correlations without optimization. We analyze their inequalities, proving several and presenting counterexamples. Overall, we provide a systematic "zoo" of correlation inequalities in and beyond holography, clarifying connections among bulk geometry, discord-type correlations, and distillable entanglement.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Non-invertible Symmetry Behind Supersymmetric ADE Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-perturbative constraints imposed by intrinsic fermionic non-invertible symmetries in 1+1 dimensional gapped systems remain largely unexplored. In this letter, we propose the superstrip algebra as a unified framework to catalog the categorical symmetry data in a massive fermionic model. The algebra and its representations explicitly encode the vacuum structure, soliton degeneracies, and their quantum numbers. As a demonstration, we apply this framework to the $\mathcal N=2$ minimal models with their least relevant deformation. We show that this specific deformation alone preserves a non-invertible superfusion category, a fermionic variant of $\text{SU}(2)_k$ known to underlie the $ADE$ classification of critical theories. Its superstrip algebra then accounts for the origin of the resulting $ADE$-type soliton spectrum and their fractional fermion number. Although our primary examples are supersymmetric and integrable, our framework itself relies on neither property, providing a new powerful tool for studying a broad class of strongly-coupled fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Composite AdS geodesics for CFT correlators and timelike entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to recover timelike worldlines in AdS from CFT data as a toy model for holographically reconstructing realistic observers. We give a bulk extremization procedure that determines composite timelike-spacelike geodesics that connect timelike-separated boundary points. The total geodesic length matches the length extracted from CFT correlators at the timelike-separated points. We show agreement in Poincar\'e AdS, for generic boundary points in global AdS, and also for the BTZ solution, in which the timelike segment probes behind the horizon. We refine related methods to compute timelike entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and recover known results.</description>

      <title>High-energy behaviour of Fermi theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 4-fermion scattering amplitude in massless Fermi theory. Based on the Bogolyubov-Parasyuk theorem, which guarantees locality of the counter terms, we derive the recurrence relations for ultraviolet divergences of diagrams that establish a connection between successive orders of perturbation theory. We check their validity up to three loops comparing them with explicit calculation made earlier. Then we construct the corresponding RG equation that sums up the leading logarithmic contributions in all orders of perturbation theory. Numerical analysis of these equations in the asymptotic regime $s\sim t\sim u \sim E^2 \to \infty$ is performed for two cases: the unit and the V-A operator in the fermion current. We found out that for the unit operator the high energy behaviour of the theory in the leading order is characterized by the presence of the Landau pole, while for the V-A operator the theory is asymptotically free. Therefore, in the latter case, radiative corrections restores unitarity, which is violated at the tree level. We compare the obtained behaviour of the amplitude with one in the theory with the intermediate gauge bosons and found an overlap between them.</description>

      <title>A new web of dualities from Majorana Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore new infrared dualities in $(2+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories involving Majorana fermions. Building on the recently proposed operator-deformation approach to bosonization dualities, we incorporate the bosonization of neutral fermions into the established web of Dirac dualities. Starting from the decomposition of a Dirac fermion into two Majorana components, we derive a hierarchy of dual bosonic descriptions based on orthogonal Chern-Simons-matter theories. This construction leads to novel boson-boson dualities, including an explicit correspondence between an $SO(N)$ theory with two real scalars and a $U(1)$ theory with one complex scalar, and their generalizations to arbitrary numbers of Majorana flavours. We analyze boundary conditions preserving chirality and demonstrate their role in matching gravitational anomalies and chiral central charges. Additional deformations yield orthogonal analogues of Ising-Gross-Neveu and pairing transitions. The resulting framework provides a unified Majorana-based extension of the three-dimensional duality web and clarifies the infrared structure of non-Abelian bosonization.</description>

      <title>2-loop free energy of M2 brane in AdS$_7 \times$ S$^4$ and surface defect anomaly in (2,0) theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS surface operator viewed as a conformal defect in rank $N$ 6d (2,0) theory is expected to have a holographic description in terms of a probe M2 brane wrapped on AdS$_3$ in the AdS$_7\times S^4$ M-theory background. The M2 brane has an effective tension T$_2= \frac{2}{ \pi} N$ so that the large tension expansion corresponds to the $1/N$ expansion. The value of the defect conformal anomaly coefficient in $SU(N)$ (2,0) theory was previously argued to be b$=12N- 9 - 3N^{-1}$. Semiclassically quantizing M2 brane it was found in arXiv:2004.04562 that the first two terms in b are indeed reproduced by the classical and 1-loop corrections to the M2 free energy. Here we address the question if the 2-loop term in the M2 brane free energy reproduces the $N^{-1}$ term in b. Despite the general non-renormalizability of the standard BST supermembrane brane action we find that, remarkably, the 2-loop correction to the free energy of the AdS$_3$ M2 brane in AdS$_7\times S^4$ is UV finite (modulo power divergences that can be removed by an analytic regularization). Moreover, the 2-loop correction vanishes in the dimensional and $\zeta$-function regularizations. This result appears to be in disagreement with the non-vanishing of the coefficient of the $N^{-1}$ term in the expected expression for the anomaly coefficient b. We discuss possible resolutions of this puzzle, including the one that the M2 brane probe computation may be capturing the surface defect anomaly in the $U(N)$ rather than the $SU(N)$ boundary 6d CFT.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the effect of rotation on the confinement/deconfinement transition of the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an apparent contradiction in the current literature about the effect of rotation in the quark gluon plasma (QGP). While results from lattice QCD predict an increase in the confinement/deconfinement critical temperature, approximated calculations and effective models, including holographic ones, lead to the opposite result. Non central heavy ion collisions form QGPs with relativistic rotational velocities. Thereby, a great interest was drawn into the effect of rotation in strongly interacting matter. In this work, we show that the apparent contradiction is associated with the choices of observer considered in each case. We consider a holographic description of a rotating plasma using a Myers-Perry black hole. For a static observer, the result is that the confinement/deconfinement temperature decreases with the angular velocity, while for an observer co-rotating with the plasma the opposite behavior is found, in agreement with lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>AdS/Deep-Learning made easy II: neural network-based approaches to holography and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply physics-informed machine learning (PIML) to solve inverse problems in holography and classical mechanics, focusing on neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving non-linear differential equations of motion. First, we introduce holographic inverse problems and demonstrate how PIML can reconstruct bulk spacetime and effective potentials from boundary quantum data. To illustrate this, two case studies are explored: the QCD equation of state in holographic QCD and $T$-linear resistivity in holographic strange metals. Additionally, we explicitly show how such holographic problems can be analogized to inverse problems in classical mechanics, modeling frictional forces with neural networks. We also explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks, offering more efficient solutions in certain cases. This manuscript aim to provide a systematic framework for using neural networks in inverse problems, serving as a comprehensive reference for researchers in machine learning for high-energy physics, with methodologies that also have broader applications in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences.</description>

      <title>Holographic origin of $a$-maximization and higher-derivative AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a consistent partially off-shell framework for evaluating higher-derivative actions of five-dimensional $\cal{N}=1$ gauged supergravity with abelian vector multiplets on AdS$_5$. Using the superconformal formalism, we show that the resulting holographic expression reproduces the trial $a$-anomaly coefficient of the dual conformal field theory, identifying the supergravity equations of motion with $a$-maximization. We present an exact correspondence between Chern-Simons couplings and the anomaly polynomial of the boundary theory. We illustrate our proposal by applying it to all known two- and four-derivative actions, including the ``off-diagonal'' invariants never before considered in the gauged supergravity literature. Finally, we argue that all invariants beyond four-derivative yield no genuinely new contributions to asymptotically AdS$_5$ BPS backgrounds, but instead reduce to linear combinations of the established two- and four-derivative actions.</description>

      <title>Imprints of flat space analyticity in de Sitter S-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix provides non-perturbative constraints on low-energy effective field theories based on the properties of high-energy theory. While the analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix is well understood, extending this framework to de Sitter space is challenging, as the expanding background complicates the definition of asymptotic states and breaks time-translation symmetry. This paper investigates how flat-space analyticity is imprinted on the de Sitter S-matrix. We derive a relation between flat-space amplitude and de Sitter S-matrix on a specific limit called the Hubble flat-space limit. Specifically, we show that the relation holds for tree-level amplitude exchanging a massive scalar field with any local derivative interactions. Finally, we argue that the flat-space limit is more compatible with the description of effective field theory, as the total energy dependence of de Sitter S-matrix becomes trivial, allowing the Mandelstam variable to be identified as the unique energy scale, just as in flat space.</description>

      <title>RG studies of scalar-field models of long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we studies the long-range interactions in non-gravitational field theories and their behaviour in the deep infrared. To model such effects, we consider a nonlocal scalar theory obtained by adding a $\phi\Box^{-1}\phi$ term to the local action. Using the functional renormalisation group, we analyse its infrared fixed-point structure. Within the LPA, we show that nonlocality modifies phase-transition patterns and can induce symmetry breaking. Extending the LPA beyond polynomial truncations, we examine the convexity property of the effective potential as $k\rightarrow 0$ and find that the flow becomes singular for $\lambda^{2}&gt;0$ before reaching the deep infrared. In the LPA$'$ framework, we find that the infrared-stable fixed point is the nonlocal Gaussian fixed point. We then generalise the model to $\phi\Box^{\sigma/2}\phi$ and analyse how the infrared properties depend on $\sigma$. With appropriate scaling choices, we show that the infrared behaviour remains unchanged up to $\sigma=d/2$ and follows Sak's prediction up to $\sigma=2$. Finally, we study higher-derivative cases within the LPA, focusing on $\sigma=4$, which corresponds to isotropic Lifshitz criticality, and obtain results consistent with earlier work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the defect entanglement entropy for co-dimension two superconformal monodromy defects in well known maximally symmetric holographic theories of various dimension. In each case we explicitly relate the universal part of the defect entanglement entropy to field theory data characterising the defect conformal field theory. We provide evidence that, unlike in the bulk theories in which the defects reside, the universal part of the defect entanglement entropy does not necessarily decrease along a renormalisation group flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic Krylov complexity in the Anabalon-Ross solitonic background, a top-down Type IIB solution describing a twisted-circle compactification of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM that flows to a confining, gapped three-dimensional theory. Following the proposal that the time derivative of Krylov complexity is dual to the proper radial momentum of a falling bulk particle, we analyze probe geodesics in this geometry. We obtain exact analytic solutions for the radial trajectory in terms of elliptic functions, confirming and extending UV and IR asymptotic expansions. The proper momentum and resulting complexity exhibit oscillatory behaviour, which we interpret as a holographic signature of the finite Hilbert-space truncation induced by the UV cutoff together with the IR end-of-space. Our results provide a controlled top-down test of the spread-momentum correspondence and highlight qualitative differences between conformal and confining holographic dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We define supersymmetric zeta functions and supersymmetric determinants, which can reveal spectral properties complementary to those captured by the supersymmetric indices. They play a crucial role in analyzing the Cardy-like behaviors of the supersymmetric indices and the supersymmetric Casimir energies associated with the supersymmetric partition functions. We investigate a variety of examples of the supersymmetric zeta functions and determinants for two-, four-, and six-dimensional supersymmetric field theories.</description>

      <title>Scalar field effective potentials in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two different definitions of a scalar field effective potential in quantum field theory in de Sitter spacetime: the standard textbook definition, and the constraint effective potential proposed by O'Raifeartaigh et al. in 1986. While these definitions are equivalent in Minkowski spacetime, they differ significantly in de Sitter. We demonstrate this by computing them both explicitly at one-loop order in perturbation theory. It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory.</description>

      <title>A supergravity dual for IKKT holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IKKT matrix model, from the holographic perspective, arises at the p=-1 endpoint of the family of dualities relating type II supergravities on near-horizon Dp-brane geometries to (p+1)-dimensional super Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supercharges. In this work, we detail and expand results reported in a recent letter by establishing the holographic dictionary between gauge-invariant operators in the lowest BPS multiplet of the matrix model and the corresponding Kaluza-Klein fluctuations of Euclidean IIB supergravity compactified on the D(-1) instanton background. The full non-linear dynamics of these fluctuations can be encoded in a one-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity, which we construct explicitly. We provide its complete Lagrangian, up to second order in fermions, together with the corresponding supersymmetry transformations. We further discuss real forms of the theory for non-compact gauge groups and their embeddings into ten-dimensional supergravities with Lorentzian signature. From the analysis of the one-dimensional Killing spinor equations, we derive different classes of half-supersymmetric solutions, and discuss their uplifts as well as their relations to known solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A powerful approach to the celebrated Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model is provided by its free-field realization. However, explicit calculations of conformal blocks are not described in the literature in full detail. We begin this study with the simplest cases of the $\hat{sl}(2)_k$ and $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ WZW models, with special emphasis on their global $sl(2)$ and $sl(3)$ symmetries of the resulting correlators, which are not explicit in this formalism. Also non-trivial is the verification of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations in the $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ case, where the answers take the form of double integrals over screening charge positions and do not look like ordinary hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore 3d $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ theories arising from twisted compactification of 4d $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ $ (G, G') $ Argyres-Douglas superconformal field theories (SCFTs), together with the 2d vertex operator algebras (VOAs) supported on the holomorphic boundary of their topologically twisted sector. Starting from the Coulomb branch BPS spectra of the $ (G,G') $ Argyres-Douglas theories, we develop a systematic and efficient method to obtain the ellipsoid partition functions of associated 3d theories using quiver mutations and wall-crossing invariants. This allows us to extract the modular data of the boundary VOAs, which are related to the Schur sectors of the 4d theories through the 4d SCFT/2d VOA correspondence. Our results provide a useful computational bridge between 4d SCFTs and 2d VOAs through interpolating 3d topological field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate finite-$N$ BPS cohomology in the D1--D5 CFT, focusing on the sector of fortuitous classes. Analyzing the supercharge cochain complexes in the $N=2$ and $N=3$ theories, we construct several explicit fortuitous classes. We study the decomposition of these cohomology classes into ${\rm SU}(2)_a\times {\rm SU}(2)_b$ representations and conjecture that, at fixed holomorphic weight, those transforming in the largest representation are necessarily fortuitous. Our results also provide strong evidence that the $R$-charge concentration phenomenon extends to the D1--D5 CFT.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, manifestly Lorentz-invariant, polynomial, and straightforwardly quantisable action for duality-symmetric gauge theories formulated using gauge potentials. Central to our construction is the identification of a harmonic higher-form symmetry which uniquely determines the field-strength and resolves the tension between Bianchi identities and dynamical equations of motion. Gauging this symmetry reproduces the flux-based description due to Sen and shows that the quantum consistency checks established for Sen's formalism are automatically subsumed by our action. Unlike Sen's flux-based formalism, our framework admits a simple minimal coupling to matter, the Witten effect, and extends readily to non-Abelian gauge fields. The new action admits remarkably simple supersymmetrisation. Using this action, we derive self-dual Yang-Mills equations from first principles and demonstrate the formalism explicitly for quantum electro-magnetodynamics in $D=4$. We also present a proof of charge quantisation that applies equally to ours and Sen's formulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a higher-dimensional universe that is a product of Minkowski space and the non-orientable Klein Bottle. The topology explicitly breaks important symmetries, such as translational invariance and (5+1)-dimensional CP invariance. Somewhat surprisingly, the (3+1)-dimensional cp of the Minkowski space can also be broken by the Klein Bottle, both explicitly and in the presence of a brane. The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries. If a brane passes through the wall, brane fermions that couple to the condensate are produced as quantified by the Bogoliubov coefficients for a time-dependent mass. The scenario meets the conditions, including cp violation, to potentially generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Schwinger effect with backreaction in 1+1D massive QED with a strong external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of a strong electric field, the vacuum is unstable to the production of pairs of charged particles -- the Schwinger effect. The created pairs extract energy from the electric field, resulting in nontrivial backreaction. In this paper, we study 1+1D massive QED subject to strong external electric fields in a self-consistent and fully quantum manner. We use the bosonized version of the theory, which attains a cosine interaction term in the presence of nonzero fermion mass $m$. However, the assumption of strong electric field justifies a perturbative treatment of the cosine interaction, i.e., an expansion in $m$. We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the electric field to first order in $m$ and show that -- surprisingly -- it satisfies a classical nonlinear partial differential equation (related to the sine-Gordon equation). We show that the electric field exhibits dissipation-free oscillations (analogous to ordinary plasma oscillations) and calculate the plasma frequency analytically. We also compare to the semiclassical approximation commonly used to study backreaction, showing that it fails to capture the $O(m)$ shift in the plasma frequency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a remarkable new class of spacetimes describing black holes immersed in a non-aligned electromagnetic field has been found. While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full "tower of symmetries". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics. Moreover, as we shall show, the novel spacetimes provide an interesting test-ground for studying the recently defined Penrose charges whose existence is intrinsically related to hidden rather than explicit symmetries.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity and Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy: Implications for Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct imaging of black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables precision tests of gravity in the strong-field regime. We investigate the cosmological evolution and optical appearance of black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy (KHDE). Utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) datasets, we constrain model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Results indicate that the late-time universe statistically favors a phantom-like equation of state ($c \approx 0.704$). Regarding the EGB coupling $\alpha$, although data favor a positive value, the parameter space permits negative values down to a theoretical stability cut-off at $\alpha \approx -0.03$. While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($\alpha=0$) within the $2\sigma$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage. Nevertheless, a characteristic systematic intrinsic deviation of $\sim 1\%$--$1.5\%$ (under a conservative accretion scenario) persists at redshifts $z \lesssim 1.5$ relative to standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions. These findings suggest that despite environmental dominance, precise statistical analyses of shadow populations could disentangle these subtle dynamic dark energy signals from the standard cosmological paradigm.</description>

      <title>Chasing the muon EDM to constrain the SMEFT and UV models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a proposal for an experiment with sensitivity to an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the muon $d_\mu$ of order $6\times10^{-23}\ e$ cm, three to four orders of magnitude below the current bound, but still seven orders of magnitude above the current bound on the EDM of the electron $d_e$, we explore the discovery potential of such an experiment. Within the dimension-six CP violating operators of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), we identify two dipole operators where $d_\mu$ has the strongest sensitivity, and four classes of four-fermion operators where it has the best sensitivity for regions of parameter space that are far from minimal flavor violation. We further consider three UV completions: vector-like leptons (VLLs), heavy vector boson with off-diagonal leptonic couplings, and two Higgs doublet model. For each, we identify the region in parameter space that will be uniquely explored by the proposed $d_\mu$ experiment. In case of VLLs, we also find measurements of $\Gamma (h \rightarrow \mu \mu)$ offer competitive sensitivity, highlighting the complementary role of collider observables. Generically, the potential reach is to ${\cal O}(10\ {\rm TeV})$ scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>Axion couplings in Orbifold GUTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the coupling of axions to gauge bosons in higher-dimensional Grand Unified Theories (GUT) inspired by string theory constructions with D-branes on orbifold singularities, the so-called orbifold GUTs. Due to their topological properties, axion couplings to gauge bosons are independent of the gauge symmetry reduction mechanism and the background geometry -- they only depend on the embedding of the SM into the UV gauge group. There are two kinds of axions in this class of theories: axions coming from gauge fields in the bulk and axions localised on the boundaries. The axion-photon coupling for the bulk axions coincide with the results from 4-dimensional GUTs, where axions which couple to photons necessarily couple also to QCD. The brane-localised axions can couple to photons independently of the QCD coupling, but if gauge couplings are approximately unified, the axions get large masses from unsuppressed instantons on the boundaries. This means that the ratio $g_{a\gamma\gamma}/m_a$ is below (or equal to) the QCD axion value for all axions in orbifold GUTs, as is the case for unified theories in 4d.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Conserved Quantities in $f(R)$-Gravity: Mei vs. Noether Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetries and conserved quantities in $f(R)$ gravity for the static, spherically symmetric Reissner--Nordstr\"om spacetime using two complementary frameworks: Noether symmetries and Mei symmetries. Starting from a canonical Lagrangian for radial metric functions and the curvature scalar $R$, we derive the associated Hamiltonian and show that the Legendre map is regular whenever both the first derivative of $f(R)$ with respect to $R$ and the second derivative with respect to $R$ is non-zero. Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity. We conclude with a comparison of the two symmetry schemes and outline applications to broader $f(R)$ models and to rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions in the mimetic extension of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, in which the Yang-Mills term is constrained to be constant. In the Abelian U(1) case, we find a static spherically symmetric solution that includes the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes as special cases. Moreover, we identify a stealth Schwarzschild solution with an electric hair. We show that it is impossible to have magnetic hair in the U(1) gauge case, while, in contrast, the non-Abelian SU(2) stealth solutions can sustain both electric and magnetic hair. Unlike the conventional SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills black hole, which requires a unit magnetic parameter to exhibit nontrivial non-Abelian contributions, the stealth mimetic SU(2) solution admits genuinely non-Abelian configurations with arbitrary integer magnetic parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism, we investigate the kinematic images of plasma before and after magnetic reconnection in Kerr-Anti-de Sitter(Kerr-AdS) black holes. Following a brief review of the Comisso-Asenjo process in Kerr-AdS black holes, we introduce the hotspot model and the imaging method. Building upon these foundational theories, we obtain the trajectory of the plasma and the temporal evolution of the hotspot images. It is found that there are three flares within the observing time, which is driven by the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism. We also discuss the influence of the cosmological parameter on the hotspot imaging. The results indicate that the hotspot image enlarges as the absolute value of $\Lambda$ increases, demonstrating that the cosmological constant significantly affects the hotspot.</description>

Abstract: We show that General Relativity and other geometrical theories can be viewed as a degenerate Otto cycle with only heat-exchange legs in emergent gravity. Including work-producing legs yields controlled violations of local Lorentz invariance and energy-momentum conservation, which produce late-time cosmological acceleration. Implications for the cosmological constant problem, structure formation and local observations are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the newly obtained static black hole in bumblebee gravity affects the behavior of accreting matter and its observable signatures. The Lorentz-violating parameter that characterizes this geometry modifies photon trajectories and shifts the location of the critical curve that defines the shadow. Using ray tracing, we examine light deflection, the structure of direct emission, lensing rings, and photon rings, and we explore three thin-disk emission models--starting at the ISCO, at the photon sphere, and at the event horizon--together with static and infalling spherical accretions. Larger values of this parameter enlarge the shadow, move all optical features outward, and suppress the observed intensity through gravitational redshift, with additional dimming produced by Doppler effects for infalling matter</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories of emergent gravity have established a deep connection between entropy and the geometry of spacetime by looking at the latter through a thermodynamic lens. In this framework, the macroscopic properties of gravity arise in a statistical way from an effective small scale discrete structure of spacetime and its information content. In this review we begin by outlining how theories of quantum gravity imply the existence of a minimum length of spacetime as a general feature. We then describe how such a structure can be implemented in a way that is independent from the details of the quantum fluctuations of spacetime via a bi-tensorial quantum metric $q_{\alpha\beta}(x, x')$ that yields a finite geodesic distance in the coincidence limit $x\rightarrow x'$. Finally, we discuss how the entropy encoded by these microscopic degrees of freedom can give rise to the field equations for gravity through a thermodynamic variational principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes in general relativity can be uniquely decomposed into a set of multipole moments. Given the usefulness of moments in the categorisation of radiation patterns, tidal deformations, and other phenomena associated with compact objects, a number of studies have explored their construction in beyond-Einstein theories of gravity. It is shown here that uniqueness does not necessarily extend across theories: by comparing a few static and spherically-symmetric solutions in different theories, we find that two distinct objects can possess the same Geroch-Hansen moments. Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments. Implications of this result are explored in the context of black-hole shadows and ``universal'' relations hinging on moment computations.</description>

      <title>Misalignment dynamics of Scalar Condensates with Yukawa coupling: Particle and Entropy Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misalignment dynamics, the non-equilibrium evolution of a scalar (or pseudoscalar) condensate in a potential landscape, broadly describes a solution to the strong CP problem, a mechanism for cold dark matter production and (pre) reheating post inflation. Often, radiative corrections are included phenomenologically by replacing the potential by the effective potential which is a \emph{static quantity}, its usefulness is restricted to (near) equilibrium situations. We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\infty)\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy. Subtle aspects of renormalization associated with the initial value problem are analyzed and resolved. Possible new manifestations of asymptotic spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as a consequence of the dynamics even in absence of tree level (SSB), and cosmological inferences are discussed.</description>

      <title>Robust evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and joint ACT, SPT, and Planck data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest a significant preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) that exhibits the phantom-like behavior in the past and has transitioned into quintessence-like behavior today. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2\sigma$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $\Lambda$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $\Lambda$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data.</description>

      <title>A Universal Smarr Formula via Coupling Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gravitational theories containing matter fields and higher-derivative corrections, the standard Smarr formula often fails unless all dimensionful couplings are incorporated consistently. Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</description>

Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) are central probes of quantum scrambling, and their generalizations have recently become key primitives for both benchmarking quantum advantage and learning the structure of Hamiltonians. Yet their behavior has lacked a unified algorithmic interpretation. We show that higher-order OTOCs naturally fit within the framework of quantum signal processing (QSP): each $\mathrm{OTOC}^{(k)}$ measures the $2k$-th Fourier component of the phase distribution associated with the singular values of a spatially resolved truncated propagator. This explains the contrasting sensitivities of time-ordered correlators (TOCs) and higher-order OTOCs to causal-cone structure and to chaotic, integrable, or localized dynamics. Based on this understanding, we further generalize higher-order OTOCs by polynomial transformation of the singular values of the spatially resolved truncated propagator. The resultant signal allows us to construct frequency-selective filters, which we call \emph{OTOC spectroscopy}. This extends conventional OTOCs into a mode-resolved tool for probing scrambling and spectral structure of quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Traversable Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations of the four-dimensional, traversable wormhole solution of Maldacena, Milekhin, and Popov(arXiv:1807.04726). The geometry is constructed by matching an asymptotically flat, near-extremal Reissner--Nordstr\"om region to a throat described by $AdS_2 \times S^2$, supported by charged massless fermions. We derive the effective scalar potential governing wave dynamics, which when viewed in the tortoise coordinate, exhibits two extremely sharp and widely separated barriers. These barriers form a resonant cavity and are a direct consequence of the near-horizon geometry of the wormhole mouths. Using time-domain integration, we analyze the wormhole's response to an initial scalar wave packet inside the throat. We find that the late-time signal contains a distinct train of echoes whose amplitude depends on the angular momentum number $l$. We show that higher $l$ modes produce significantly stronger echoes, as the corresponding potential barriers are taller and more reflective, which results in more efficient trapping of the wave within the wormhole throat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years tantalizing signs for a novel phase have been reported that is chirally symmetric but nevertheless exhibits massive bound states. The necessary condition for such a phase, referred to as Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG), is the cancellation of all (continuous and discrete) 't~Hooft anomalies. In 3+1 dimensions this occurs in systems containing a multiple of 16 massless Weyl fermions. SMG was originally discovered in lower dimensional condensed matter systems. We present results investigating four dimensional field theories with gauge group SU(3). Our findings suggest that SU(3) with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions exhibits an SMG phase not only on the lattice but also in the infinite cutoff continuum limit. If confirmed, SMG could provide a new UV completion of the standard model and give rise to new scenarios for beyond standard model physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinite towers of higher-order corrections to General Relativity have been proposed as a mechanism to resolve singularities in early-universe cosmology and black holes, in a variety of settings. In this work, we consider an infinite tower of higher-order Proca corrections inspired by dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. We find that the Big Bang singularity present in General Relativity is replaced by an inflationary epoch. Furthermore, the Lovelock-Proca tower allows for regular planar black hole solutions and spherically symmetric black holes with primary hair.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Calculation of Particle Creation from Analog Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of particle creation from accelerating mirrors is crucial for interpreting forthcoming analog Hawking radiation experiments such as AnaBHEL. However, realistic experimental setups render the associated Bogoliubov integrals analytically intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the Inertial Replacement Method (IRM), a hybrid analytic-numerical framework for computing Bogoliubov coefficients for general moving-mirror trajectories. The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable domain wall (DW) must decay to avoid overclose the Universe. A commonly used solution is to slightly break the PQ symmetry by introducing a bias term in the potential. In this work, we propose an alternative, symmetry-preserving mechanism: coupling the axion field to a helical primordial magnetic field (PMF) via the Chern-Simons term. Using three-dimensional lattice simulations, we evolve the DW network and demonstrate that it can successfully drive DW decay. Our quantitative results further show that the correlation length of the PMF plays a crucial role in determining the decay rate of the DW network and the resulting axion and gravitational wave radiation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Minimal Hilbert Space in the Classical Dual States of Quantum Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.</description>

      <title>Refinements of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis under Local Rotational Invariance via Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dipole Portal Vector Dark Matter at Fixed-Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model featuring a sub-GeV vector dark matter by augmenting the Standard Model with a new non-Abelian dark $SU(2)_D$, spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values of a scalar doublet and a triplet. Interactions between the dark and visible sectors arise through a dimension-5 non-Abelian avatar of kinetic mixing portal, inducing effective magnetic dipole couplings of the dark matter, with the photon and Z boson. The resulting spectrum of the dark gauge bosons naturally exhibits an inverse mass hierarchy between the dark matter and the $Z^\prime$, leading to interesting phenomenology at fixed-target experiments such as LDMX through dark off-shell bremsstrahlung, dark Higgs-strahlung, invisible vector meson decay, and visible decays. We compute the thermal relic abundance across sub-GeV dark matter masses, with regions of freeze-out proceeding via forbidden annihilation into dark sector states or direct annihilation into Standard Model states. Bounds from a broad set of laboratory probes, along with cosmological and astrophysical observations, are incorporated in our analysis. Among them, the most restrictive bounds originate from direct detection experiments, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, collider searches, and the CMB. Our results demonstrate that a sizeable region of the parameter space remains consistent with the observed relic abundance and the existing experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios. We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.</description>

      <title>SU($N_c$) confinement and color $N_c$-ality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, we have argued that the net quark number gained by a bath of quarks and gluons upon bringing an external static quark probe, while being equal to $1$ in the high temperature, deconfined phase, is equal to $0$ or $3$ in the low temperature, confined phase, depending on the value of the quark chemical potential. This establishes a clear-cut connection between the confinement of a medium as probed by order parameters such as the Polyakov loop, and the ability of that same medium to screen the quark probe into states with the same net quark content as mesons or baryons. In this work, we extend these findings to the SU($N_c$) color group, consider color probes in various (fundamental and non-fundamental) representations, and conjecture a rationale of how these results could be recovered from a purely thermodynamic argument that shortcuts the use of the Euclidean functional framework, while emphasizing the role of color $N_c$-ality as a proxy for center symmetry within the Minkowskian framework.</description>

      <title>The free energy of the large-$N$ fermionic Chern$\unicode{x2013}$Simons theory in the 'temporal' gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11020v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the computational evidence for the Bose$\unicode{x2013}$Fermi duality of fundamental fields coupled to $U(N)$ Chern$\unicode{x2013}$Simons theories originates in large-$N$ calculations performed in the light-cone gauge. This gauge is ill-suited to computations in curved spacetimes, like the evaluation of the partition function on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$ for arbitrary genus $g$. In this paper, we use another gauge, the 'temporal' gauge, to set up the computation of this partition function. In the large-$N$ limit, and the special case $\Sigma_g=\mathbb{R}^2$, we take the computation through to the end by setting up and solving the gap equations, generalizing tricks explored in arXiv:1410.0558 to finite temperature. Our final results are in perfect agreement with earlier light-cone gauge results, providing a consistency check of both the formalism developed in this paper as well as previously performed light-cone gauge computations. In a follow-up paper, we will report on using our formalism to explicitly compute the partition function on $S^2 \times S^1$ for a finite-sized sphere.</description>

Abstract: We analyze correlation functions of $SU(k) \times SU(2)_F$ flavor currents in a family of three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal field theories, combining analytic bootstrap methods with input from supersymmetric localization. Via holographic duality, we extract gluon and graviton scattering amplitudes of M-theory on ${\rm AdS}_4\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$ which contains a $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ orbifold singularity. From these results, we derive aspects of the effective description of M-theory on the orbifold singularity beyond its leading low energy limit. We also determine a threshold correction to the holographic correlator, which vanishes due to equal and opposite contributions from the two-loop gluon and the tree-level bulk graviton exchange.</description>

      <title>One loop determinant in the extremal black hole from quasinormal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06165v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the one-loop partition function of a scalar field in the near-horizon geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\"{o}m black hole from an infinite product over quasinormal modes using the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev (DHS) formula. We show that the logarithmic divergent term of the one-loop partition function computed using the DHS formula agrees with the heat kernel method. Using the same formula, we also evaluate the one-loop partition function of a scalar field in the near-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole and observe that it reduces to the same in the near-horizon $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\"{o}m black hole when the angular velocity at the horizon is tuned to $2\pi T_{BH}$ value. We observe that, for higher spin fields, the mode functions are not smooth at the horizon for certain quasinormal frequencies; therefore, we remove them to obtain the one-loop determinant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the methods of \cite{Alexandrov:2023zjb} to compute generating series of D4D2D0 indices with a single unit of D4 charge for several compact Calabi-Yau threefolds, assuming modularity of these indices. Our examples include a $\mathbb{Z}_{7}$ quotient of R{\o}dland's pfaffian threefold, a $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$ quotient of Hosono-Takagi's double quintic symmetroid threefold, the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ quotient of the bicubic intersection in $\mathbb{P}^{5}$, and the $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$ quotient of the quintic hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^{4}$. For these examples we compute GV invariants to the highest genus that available boundary conditions make possible, and for the case of the quintic quotient alone this is sufficiently many GV invariants for us to make one nontrivial test of the modularity of these indices. As discovered in \cite {Alexandrov:2023zjb}, the assumption of modularity allows us to compute terms in the topological string genus expansion beyond those obtainable with previously understood boundary data. We also consider five multiparameter examples with $h^{1,1}&gt;1$, for which only a single index needs to be computed for modularity to fix the rest. We propose a modification of the formula in \cite{Alexandrov:2022pgd} that incorporates torsion to solve these models. Our new examples are only tractable because they have sufficiently small triple intersection and second Chern numbers, which happens because all of our examples are suitable quotient manifolds. In an appendix we discuss some aspects of quotient threefolds and their Wall data.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbation theory with trinity of scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit formulation of cosmological perturbation theory for three-field models with a flat field space. By performing rotations to align one field with the direction of curvature perturbations and applying the same rotations to the other two field directions, we introduce the semikinematic basis, which is applicable to models with more than two fields. We derive the governing equations in this basis. We also stress a characteristic property of more-than-two-field models: the freedom in choosing the isocurvature perturbations. This framework enables the computation of the curvature and two isocurvature power spectra for any given potential. We numerically solve the background and perturbation equations for three distinct scenarios. First, to validate the consistency of our three-field formalism, we examine an effective two-field model inspired by the two-block case of the multigiant vacua matrix inflation scenario. Next, we analyze a purely three-field system without direct interfield interactions. Finally, we study a three-field case that incorporates direct interactions. For all scenarios, we numerically compute the curvature perturbation power spectra and highlight the effects of rapid turns on the spectra. Finally, we investigate the relationship between these quantities and the observables in the early radiation-dominated era. Through both general arguments and a simple example, we show that three-field inflation can yield a much richer phenomenology. This is particularly true when we assume the initial perturbations in the radiation era include two isocurvature modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study null hypersurfaces approaching null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes within the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The null Raychaudhuri constraint is shown to asymptote to the Bondi mass-loss formula, interpreted as a stress tensor conservation law. This stress tensor, the null Brown-York tensor, yields a Carrollian stress tensor at null infinity from the bulk. Furthermore, we establish that the canonical phase space on finite-distance null hypersurfaces asymptotes to the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space. This connection between finite-distance null physics and null infinity unveils promising insights.</description>

      <title>Can black holes preserve $N &gt; 4$ supersymmetry?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of near-BPS black holes are governed by the breaking of the conformal symmetry that emerges near their horizons. Using the classification of superconformal symmetries, we systematically classify and quantize all effective theories that can arise in the near-BPS limit of black holes. Using these results, we argue, under certain physical assumptions, that BPS black holes cannot preserve more than four supercharges. This conclusion is consistent with existing constructions in string theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers and the effects of the Isospin chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM) minimally coupled to Maxwell theory, which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit which also takes into account the electromagnetic interactions. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. The effects of the Isospin chemical potential can be included as well: in particular, we will be able to construct explicitly the BPS bound and the corresponding BPS configurations also in the case in which the Isospin chemical potential is non-zero. The physical interpretations of our analytical results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Bulk Reconstruction of Scalar Excitations in Flat$_3$/CCFT$_2$ and the Flat Limit from (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>

Abstract: We explore the reconstruction of bulk local states in three-dimensional flat spacetime (Flat$_3$) using states from two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field theories (CCFT$_2$), proposed as dual field theories in one lower dimension. For massive scalar-type bulk excitations, reconstruction is achieved through states in the induced representation. This method successfully reproduces the bulk massive scalar spectrum and the bulk-to-bulk propagator. Additionally, we identify a new flat limit from AdS$_3$ and dS$_3$ spacetimes, further validating our proposal for scalar reconstruction in Flat$_3$/CCFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (3+1) dimensional analog of the Kaluza-Klein (4+1) dimensional metric. After dimensional reduction of the Taub-NUT metric to (3) spatial dimensions, by treating time as the extra curled dimension (since the closed time-like curves can exist in the Taub-NUT framework, such a dimensional reduction is justified), we end up with three dimensional Einstein field equations plus the Maxwell equations for the gravitomagnetic field, which also acts as a source to Einstein field equations. Hence, the Taub-NUT metric unifies gravity and the NUT charge related gavitomagnetism in four dimensions, at the same footing the Kaluza-Klein metric unifies gravity and electromagnetism in five dimensions. We also introduce a relation between the 4-dimensional gravitational constant and the NUT charge.</description>

Abstract: We show that superrotations can be described using the geometric conformal completion method of Penrose. In particular, superrotation charges can be described and calculated using the linkage method of Geroch and Winicour.
  Whether superrotation charges are calculated using the coordinate based Bondi formalism or the geometric Penrose formalism, the fact that the superrotation blows up at a point makes the superrotation charge formally ill defined. Nonetheless, we show that it can be made well defined through a regularization procedure devised by Flanagan and Nichols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local supersymmetries have been a guiding principle to construct smooth horizonless supergravity solutions. By computing brane densities from the brane low-energy effective action, we classify the BPS solutions that have the maximal local supersymmetry structure, with sixteen supersymmetries. We find that whenever the gauge group is broken to its maximal abelian subgroup, the brane construction becomes purely geometric and one can identify the preserved local supercharges. This class of solution includes two- and three-charge monopoles, and polarised branes. On the contrary, we show that instantons involve pure non-abelian degrees of freedom that cannot have a geometric interpretation. Hence, we conjecture that such instantons cannot be fully captured by supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to bootstrap crossing equations in Conformal Field Theory and apply it to finite temperature theories on $S^1\times \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. The proposed approach does not rely on positivity constraints and does not employ uncontrolled truncation schemes. Instead, we capture the contribution of an infinite number of operators in conformal block expansions using suitable functions, which are bootstrapped (numerically) together with a finite number of exposed CFT data. Our approach at finite temperature employs three key ingredients: $(i)$ the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, $(ii)$ thermal dispersion relations and $(iii)$ Neural Networks that model spin-dependent tail functions within the conformal block expansions. We test the efficiency of the new method in the case of Generalized Free Fields and use it to perform a preliminary bootstrap analysis of double-twist thermal data in holographic CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex states of quantum gravity in flat and AdS gravity can have features that are inaccessible to classical asymptotic observers. The missing information appears to such observers to be hidden behind a horizon or in a baby universe. Here we use the gravitational path integral to ask whether quantum observables can access the hidden data. We show that generic probes give a universal result and contain no information about the state. However, a probe appropriately fine-tuned to the state can give a large signal because of novel wormhole saddles in the path integral. Thus, in these settings, asymptotic observers cannot easily determine the state of the universe, but can check a proposal for it. Using these fine-tuned probes we show that an asymptotic observer can detect information hidden in a disconnected baby universe. Furthermore we show that the state of a two-boundary black hole can be detected using Lorentzian operators localised on just one of the boundaries.</description>

      <title>The String Theory Photoverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String theory compactifications come with numerous $U(1)$ factors, implying the presence of many hidden photons in the low-energy EFT. One may call this the ``string photoverse''. We argue that, generically, these hidden photons are massless and do not couple to any light dark current such that, naively, kinetic mixing with the Standard Model is unobservable. The leading interactions of these ``superhidden'' photons are then dimension-6 dipole operators which couple them to quarks or leptons and the Higgs field. This induces magnetic and electric dipole moments with respect to both the superhidden photons as well as, through kinetic mixing, to the Standard Model photon. We derive these couplings by dimensionally reducing the fermionic action of 7-branes realizing the Standard Model: In the first step to 6d theories on intersection curves and then, in the presence of fluxes, to our 4d chiral EFT. We analyze how experiments and observations can employ this effect to place lower bounds on the string scale, which is relevant for compactifications with very large volumes. Finally, we briefly discuss how supersymmetry implies the presence of relatively light photinos and hence an accompanying ``photinoverse'', which may be observed via renormalizable mixing effects.</description>

Abstract: We compute the Higgs branch chiral ring of a simple class of 5d theories at strong coupling. A deformation by the instanton mass implies that the chiral ring at weak coupling is renormalized by a nilpotent operator, the gaugino bilinear. Consequently, F-term equations alone do not suffice to completely determine the moduli space of vacua and perturbative non-renormalization arguments are invalidated.</description>

      <title>Magnusian: Relating the Eikonal Phase, the On-Shell Action, and the Scattering Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two fundamentally distinct types of quantities are both called "eikonal" in present amplitudes literature. The unitarity of the S-matrix ensures it can be written as the exponential of a Hermitian operator. The eikonal generator or Magnusian, which is the classical limit of the expectation value of that operator, generates all scattering observables. The leading order classical behavior of the phase of an S-matrix element is called the classical eikonal phase, and it coincides with a classical on-shell action. We demonstrate that the eikonal generator (Magnusian) and the eikonal phase (classical on-shell action) are inequivalent and find the exact general relationship between them. That relationship explains the special case of integrable scattering in which the two do coincide up to a Legendre transformation and explains why such a correspondence fails in general when spin or radiation are included.</description>

Abstract: A simple scheme to express the Mellin transform of $D$-dimensional Euclidean conformal bootstrap equation is presented by relating conformal blocks to a Gauss-Grassmann (GG) system due to Gelfand-Graev, associated to conformal integrals, which, in turn, are generalised hypergeometric functions. Usefulness of the expression for obtaining bounds on the spectrum of fields is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Entropic Interpretation of Einstein Equation in dS/CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy, which is a non-Hermitian generalization of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), is equivalent to the perturbative Einstein equation in three-dimensional de Sitter (dS) space, assuming the dS/CFT correspondence. Our analysis reveals that the geodesic that accurately satisfies the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy consists of a timelike curve and a curve whose coordinates are complex. We also demonstrate that infinitesimal changes to the pseudo entropy satisfy a Klein-Gordon equation in two-dimensional de Sitter space. These imply the emergence of a time coordinate from a Euclidean CFT in dS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Full spectrum of Love numbers of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in D-dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrollian Holography aims to provide a holographic description of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, in terms of a novel kind of `carrollian' conformal field theory defined on the spacetime null conformal boundary $\mathscr{I}$. The goal of these lectures is to offer a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to this active field of research. The main focus is given to the correspondence between massless scattering amplitudes, including gravitational amplitudes, and correlators in carrollian conformal field theory. Strong emphasis is put on the development of carrollian conformal field theory as an intrinsic, independent, and non-perturbative framework in which to formulate gravitational scattering theory.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive derivation of the Einstein-Maxwell charges and fluxes in the near-horizon region of a four-dimensional non-extremal black hole, with vanishing cosmological constant. Specifically, we present a detailed derivation of the Noether charges within both the metric and first-order formulations, elucidating the relationship between the Carrollian internal boost charge and the Lorentz boost charge. It is well-established in the literature that Carrollian fluids exhibit an internal local boost symmetry; we demonstrate that this symmetry precisely corresponds to a Lorentz internal transformation. Finally, we prove that the near-horizon Einstein equations can be obtained from the flux-balance law by employing the generalized Barnich-Troessaert bracket.</description>

      <title>Analyticity of the Black Hole S-Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the analytic structure of the S-matrix in the complex-frequency plane for classical wave scattering on a Schwarzschild background in four space-time dimensions. Our argument relies on the analytic continuation of the gravitational potential, with the singularity behind the horizon playing a crucial role. We find that in the lower half-plane the partial-wave amplitudes are analytic except for the quasinormal-mode poles and the branch cut associated with late-time tails. As a direct consequence of causality, the retarded Green's function and absorption amplitude are analytic in the upper-half plane. We show, however, that Stokes phenomena can obstruct this analyticity domain from carrying over to the elastic amplitude, which instead develops a branch-cut in the upper-half plane. We also determine the effect of infrared (IR) regulators on the analytic structure, showing that polynomial boundedness requires a sharp lower bound on the IR cutoff in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a surface observable for nonabelian four-dimensional $BF$ theory with a cosmological term. The surface observable yields new $2$-knot invariants that may extend beyond known examples such as the Alexander invariant. By BV pushforward, the surface observable induces an electric observable in nonabelian Yang-Mills theory, offering a concrete realization of 't~Hooft operators. An application to self-dual Yang-Mills theory is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Relation between Commutative and Non-Commutative Descriptions of D-branes in Large R-R Field Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Seiberg-Witten map to first order in the non-commutativity parameter for D-branes in the presence of a large R-R background field. This result enables a systematic investigation of the commutative formulation of the corresponding Lagrangian. In the SU($N$) sector, the map introduces a non-local operator. In contrast, in the U(1) sector, this non-locality can be removed. This contrast suggests that the essential source of non-local behavior lies in the non-Abelian degrees of freedom. The commutative description obtained here offers further insight into both the Dirac-Born-Infeld structure and its possible extensions to the dynamics of M5-branes.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of categorical symmetries in (Non-) Unitary Rational CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities without invoking any SymTFT construction, relying instead on a purely 2d RCFT analysis. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fully BPS and a broad class of half-BPS stationary configurations of four-dimensional Euclidean N=2 supergravity with higher-derivative interactions. Working within the off-shell conformal supergravity framework of de Wit and Reys (arXiv:1706.04973), we analyse the complete set of Killing spinor equations and obtain the corresponding algebraic and differential constraints. We further derive the Euclidean attractor equations and evaluate the Wald entropy for the fully BPS AdS_2 x S^2 background. For half-BPS stationary configurations, we obtain the generalized stabilization equations expressing all fields in terms of harmonic functions on three-dimensional flat base space, extending the Lorentzian analysis of Cardoso et al (arXiv:hep-th/0009234) to the Euclidean signature. Our results provide a framework for studying supersymmetric saddles and computing the gravitational indices entirely within Euclidean higher-derivative supergravity, without recourse to analytic continuation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate behavior of brane backgrounds under poly-vector deformations in Type IIB and D=11 supergravities. We find that the standard bi-vector deformations add dissolved F1 string charge to a Dp-brane background, quadri-vector deformations add D3-brane charge, tri- and six-vector deformations in D=11 add M2- and M5-brane charges respectively. We discuss these results in the context of NRCS and OM theories.</description>

      <title>A Weyl's law for black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a Weyl's law for the quasi-normal modes of black holes that recovers the structural features of the standard Weyl's law for the eigenvalues of Laplacian-like operators in compact regions. Specifically, we propose that the asymptotics of the counting function $N(\omega)$ of quasi-normal modes of $(d+1)$-dimensional black holes follows a power-law $N(\omega)\sim \mathrm{Vol}_d^{\mathrm{eff}}\omega^d$, with $\mathrm{Vol}_d^{\mathrm{eff}}$ an effective $d$-volume determined by the light-trapping properties of the black hole geometry. Concretely, the factorisation $\mathrm{Vol}_d^{\mathrm{eff}} \sim \left(8\pi/\kappa\right) \cdot \mathrm{Vol}^{\mathrm{trapped}}_{d-1}$ makes apparent the two underlying structural ingredients, namely the (local) redshift effect controlled by the surface gravity $\kappa$ and the volume $\mathrm{Vol}^{\mathrm{trapped}}_{d-1}$ of the (phase space) trapped set. In particular, this proposal extends the Weyl's law proved by Dyatlov &amp; Zworski for the counting of slowest decaying quasi-normal modes, to include overtones. As an application, these Weyl's laws could provide a probe into the effective spacetime dimensionality, upon the counting of sufficiently many quasi-normal modes in the ringdown signal of binary black hole mergers.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the superalgebra of derivations generated by the fundamental forms on manifolds with reduced structure group. In particular, we point out a relation between the algebra of derivations of heterotic geometries that admit Killing spinors and the commutator algebra of holonomy symmetries in sigma models. We use this to propose a Lie bracket on the space of fundamental forms of all heterotic geometries with a non-compact holonomy group and present the associated derivation algebras. We also explore the extension of these results to heterotic geometries with compact holonomy groups and, more generally, to manifolds with reduced structure group. A brief review of the classification of heterotic geometries that admit Killing spinors and an extension of this classification to some heterotic inspired geometries are also included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an alternative implementation of the principle of general local covariance for algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs) which is more flexible than the original one by Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch. This is realized by considering the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK} : \mathbf{Loc}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{CAT}$ which assigns to each Lorentzian manifold $M$ the category $\mathsf{HK}(M)$ of Haag-Kastler-style AQFTs over $M$ and to each embedding $f:M\to N$ a pullback functor $f^\ast = \mathsf{HK}(f) : \mathsf{HK}(N) \to \mathsf{HK}(M)$ restricting theories from $N$ to $M$. Locally covariant AQFTs are recovered as the points of the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK}$. The main advantages of this new perspective are: 1.) It leads to technical simplifications, in particular with regard to the time-slice axiom, since global problems on $\mathbf{Loc}$ become families of simpler local problems on individual Lorentzian manifolds. 2.) Some aspects of the Haag-Kastler framework which previously got lost in locally covariant AQFT, such as a relative compactness condition on the open subsets in a Lorentzian manifold $M$, are reintroduced. 3.) It provides a radically new perspective on descent conditions in AQFT, i.e. local-to-global conditions which allow one to recover a global AQFT on a Lorentzian manifold $M$ from its local data in an open cover $\{U_i \subseteq M\}$.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Mpemba-like patterns in effective temperature dynamics of strongly coupled dissipative quantum chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous thermalization, particularly the crossings of temperature trajectories from different initial states termed Mpemba crossings (MPCs), have intrigued scientists for decades. While recent studies in quantum systems suggest that initial conditions play a decisive role in its emergence, they offer limited insight into MPCs in complex, highly nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we investigate temperature dynamics in the strongly coupled, quantum chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is dual to the low-energy dynamics of 2D dilaton gravity. Our findings reveal a dynamically driven nonequilibrium mechanism underlying MPCs during rapid thermalization, with implications for gravitational systems. We explore quench dynamics in SYK systems under three conditions: coupling to a single SYK thermal bath, coupling to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. We find that strong system-bath coupling induces oscillating effective temperatures and trajectory crossings in transient states due to nonequilibrium statistics, phenomena absent in quasi-static thermodynamics and Lindbladian SYKs. These MPCs highlight a unique feature of anomalous thermalization of strongly coupled quantum chaotic systems driven far from equilibrium. Besides, the results also provide qualitative insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes strongly interacting with their environment, such as primordial black holes in the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions describing a fake Schwarzschild black hole that cannot be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole by observations. They are constructed by attaching a spherically symmetric dynamical interior solution with a matter field to the Schwarzschild exterior solution at the event horizon without a lightlike thin shell. The dynamical region inside a Killing horizon of a static spherically symmetric perfect-fluid solution obeying an equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ can be the interior of a fake Schwarzschild black hole. The matter field inside such a black hole is an anisotropic fluid that violates at least the weak energy condition and can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. While the author constructed the first model of fake Schwarzschild black holes using Semiz's solution for $\chi=-1/5$, we present another one using Whittaker's solution for $\chi=-1/3$ in this paper. We also present a model of fake Kerr black holes whose interior is filled with a different matter field violating only the dominant energy condition near the event horizon. Because it contradicts the conservation theorem, this configuration of black holes is, in fact, precluded by the dominant energy condition.</description>

Abstract: It is known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that is known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Double BFV quantisation of 3d Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the cohomological setting developed by Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky (BFV), which produces a resolution of coisotropic reduction in terms of hamiltonian dg manifolds, to the case of nested coisotropic embeddings $C\hookrightarrow C_\circ \hookrightarrow F$ inside a symplectic manifold $F$. To this, we naturally assign $\underline{C}$ and $\underline{C_\circ}$, as well as the respective BFV dg manifolds. We show that the data of a nested coisotropic embedding defines a natural graded coisotropic embedding inside the BFV dg manifold assigned to $\underline{C}$, whose reduction can further be resolved using the BFV prescription. We call this construction \emph{double BFV resolution}, and we use it to prove that "resolution commutes with reduction" for a general class of nested coisotropic embeddings. We then deduce a quantisation of $\underline{C}$, from the (graded) geometric quantisation of the double BFV Hamiltonian dg manifold (when it exists), following the quantum BFV prescription. As an application, we provide a well defined candidate space of (physical) quantum states of three-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert theory, which is thought of as a partial reduction of the Palatini--Cartan model for gravity.</description>

      <title>A new class of semiclassical gravity solutions, gravitational quantum stealths and regular Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling $\xi = 1/2$. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the semiclassical system is quasi-linear hyperbolic and, within this class, provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassical gravity without spacetime symmetries. These two-point functions yield stress-energy expectation values proportional to the spacetime metric (modulo ambiguities). If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply and test our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: II. Time-domain and frequency-domain models for nonspinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect$\unicode{x2014}$a permanent shift in the GW strain that arises from nonlinear GW interactions in the wave zone$\unicode{x2014}$is a prediction of general relativity which has not yet been observed. The amplitude of the GW memory effect from binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers is small compared to that of primary (oscillatory) GWs and is unlikely to be detected by current ground-based detectors. Evidence for its presence in the population of all the BBH mergers is more likely, once thousands of detections are made by these detectors. Having an accurate and computationally efficient waveform model of the memory signal will assist detecting the memory effect with current data-analysis pipelines. In this paper, we build on our prior work to develop analytical time-domain and frequency-domain models for the dominant nonlinear memory multipole signal ($l=2$, $m=0$) from nonspinning BBH mergers in quasicircular orbits. The model is calibrated for mass ratios between one and eight. There are three parts to the time-domain signal model: a post-Newtonian inspiral, a quasinormal-mode-based ringdown, and a phenomenological signal during the late inspiral and merger (which interpolates between the inspiral and ringdown). The time-domain model also has an analytical Fourier transform, which we compute in this paper. We assess the accuracy of our model using the mismatch between our waveform model and the memory signal computed from the oscillatory modes of a numerical-relativity surrogate model. We use the advanced LIGO sensitivity curve from the fourth observing run and find that the mismatch increases with the total mass of the system and is of order $10^{-2}\unicode{x2013}10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall as Cosmological Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the domain wall within the framework of a cosmological harmonic oscillator. We investigate the interaction between the domain wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in the oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for resolving the domain wall problem through the phenomenon of resonant oscillation. Resonant oscillation occurs when the frequency of the external driving force aligns with the intrinsic frequency of the domain wall. This synchrony can significantly amplify the amplitude of the oscillation. If the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation threshold, the domain wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.</description>

      <title>Certified randomness from quantum speed limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum speed limits are usually regarded as fundamental restrictions, constraining the amount of computation that can be achieved within some given time and energy. Complementary to this intuition, here we show that these limitations are also of operational value: they enable the secure generation of certified randomness. We consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with some (experimentally determined or promised) upper bound on the energy uncertainty of the average prepared quantum state, but without any further assumptions on the devices, Hilbert space or Hamiltonian. Given that we can freely choose the time at which to apply the untrusted preparation procedure, we show that this scenario admits the generation of randomness that is secure against adversaries with additional classical information. We show how to determine the amount of certified randomness given the observed correlations, discuss how interactions with the environment are taken into account, and sketch a conceivable experimental implementation. In particular, we show that single-mode coherent states admit this kind of certification of non-zero randomness in some parameter regimes, reinforcing existing demonstrations of nonclassicality in the simple harmonic oscillator. Our results extend earlier efforts to devise semi-device-independent protocols grounded in reasonable physical assumptions, and they contribute to the understanding of time-energy uncertainty relations via their operational consequences.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule and under the additional assumptions of the integrability and unitarity of the Tomonaga-Schwinger dynamics and the foliation-independence of rays on acausal Cauchy hypersurfaces, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated precompact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures, where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the instantaneous-measurement idealisation, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. These results reaffirm the consistency of the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture of relativistic quantum theory, for which unitarity, integrability and foliation-independence of the states exclude superluminal signalling despite the ``instantaneity" of a side-cone measurement collapse rule. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the conversion mechanism from scalar field to gravitational waves in magnetic background in $f(R)$ gravity minimal coupled to the Maxwell electrodynamics. Applying the conversion in early universe with primordial magnetic field and the neutron star with strong magnetosphere, the generated gravitational waves, converted from the scalar field, exhibit distinct power spectra which can be potentially probed by future experiments such as DECIGO, BBO, CE and ET.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity, describing a collinear array of an arbitrary number of Kerr black holes inside an expanding bubble of nothing is built, thanks to the inverse scattering technique. Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the bubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black hole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble surrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the two constituents.</description>

      <title>NNLO electron structure functions (PDFs) from SCET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the electron structure functions, aka parton distribution functions (PDFs), to NNLO in QED. The calculation is based on the definition of the PDFs in terms of operator matrix elements in soft collinear effective theory (SCET) and directly performed in momentum space. The electron PDFs describe the universal effects of collinear initial state radiation (ISR) off the electron (or positron) in DIS or $e^+ e^-$ collision events. The parton collinear to the electron that enters the hard scattering process governed by the energy scale $Q$ can be a photon or a (anti)fermion with mass $m_f \sim m_e \ll Q$. Our SCET momentum-space calculation confirms earlier results obtained from a QED computation in Mellin space and extends them by taking more than one massive fermion flavor into account. The well-known factorization of sufficiently inclusive cross sections into PDFs with massive fermions and hard partonic cross sections with massless fermions at leading order in $m_e/Q$ is discussed from the SCET perspective. Analogies to the nonperturbative PDFs and collinear factorization in QCD are pointed out. Based on this factorization DGLAP-type resummation of large logarithms of the ratio $m_e/Q$ is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Covariant Carrollian Electric and Magnetic Limits of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Carrollian limit ($c \to 0$) of General Relativity provides the geometric language for describing null hypersurfaces, such as black hole event horizons and null infinity. Motivated by the well-established electric and magnetic limits of Galilean electromagnetism, we perform a systematic analysis of the low-velocity limit of linearized gravity to derive its Carrollian counterparts. Using a 1+3 covariant decomposition, we study the transformation properties of linear tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) on a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background under Carrollian boosts. We demonstrate that, analogous to the electromagnetic case, the full set of linearized Einstein's equations is not Carrollian-invariant. Instead, the theory bifurcates into two distinct and consistent frameworks: a Carrollian Electric Limit and a Carrollian Magnetic Limit. In the electric limit, dynamics are frozen, leaving a static theory of tidal forces ($E_{ab}$) constrained by the matter distribution. In contrast, the Magnetic Limit yields a consistent dynamical theory where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor ($H_{ab}$), which governs gravito-magnetic and radiative effects, remains well-defined and is sourced by the spacetime shear. This framework resolves ambiguities in defining Carrollian gravity and provides a robust theory for gravito-magnetic dynamics in ultra-relativistic regimes. Our results have direct implications for the study of black hole horizons, gravitational memory, and the holographic principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ Homogeneous Electron Fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model -- a small, square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions -- are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 100$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Phenomenological study of Quantum-gravity effects is introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Bound State Perturbations in the Interior of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit our earlier work and investigate the bound state perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The bound sates are defined as the perturbations in the interior of the black hole with an imaginary spectrum which are regular at the center of black hole while their time-dependent profile falls off exponentially on the event horizon. Using the scale factor in the expanding direction in the interior of the black hole as the clock, we rewrite the corresponding Regge-Wheeler equation and solve it semi-analytically as well as numerically. We confirm that the bound state solutions exist for scalar, vector and axial tensor perturbations. It is shown that for a given value of $\ell &gt;s$, there are total $\ell-s$ such bound states. We obtain the universal lower bound $2 G M \omega_I &gt;1$ for the spectrum of bound state which is asymptotically saturated in the large $\ell$ limit. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound on the spectrum of axial perturbations which for large $\ell$ scales like $2 G M \omega_I \lesssim 0.04\, \ell^4 $. As observed recently, these bound states have the curious property that the profile of the total wave function has a non-zero magnitude near the future event horizon.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff implies Quasi-topological</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-topological gravities (QTGs) are higher-curvature extensions of Einstein gravity in $D\geq 5$ spacetime dimensions. Throughout the years, different notions of QTGs constructed from analytic functions of polynomial curvature invariants have been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we show that all such definitions may be reduced to three distinct inequivalent notions: type I QTGs, for which the field equations evaluated on a single-function static and spherically symmetric ansatz are second order; type II QTGs, whose field equations on general static and spherically symmetric backgrounds are second order; and type III QTGs, for which the trace of the field equations on a general background is second order. We show that type II QTGs are a subset of type I QTGs and that type III QTGs are a subset of type II QTGs modulo pure Weyl invariants. Moreover, we prove that type II QTGs possess second-order equations on general spherical backgrounds. This allows us to prove that any theory satisfying a Birkhoff theorem is a type II QTG, and that the reverse implication also holds up to a zero-measure set of theories. For every theory satisfying Birkhoff's theorem, the most general spherically symmetric solution is a generalization of the Schwarzschild spacetime characterized by a single function which satisfies an algebraic equation.</description>

      <title>The Geometric View of Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent critiques of the semantic conception of scientific theories suggest that a theory is not best formulated as a collection of models satisfying some set of kinematical or dynamical conditions. Thus it has been argued that additional structure on the set of models is required. Furthermore, there are calls for developing a 'theory of theories', where what was formerly a 'theory' is seen as a 'model' within a larger theoretical structure. This paper makes a two-pronged proposal for the ''shape'' that physical theories should take, based on recent insights on dualities and quasi-dualities in physics. First, I develop a geometric view of theories, according to which a physical theory is a set of models with topological and geometric structure on it. This general view is briefly illustrated in an example from quantum cosmology. Second, I make a more specific proposal for a natural structure that can encompass various 'theories' as its models, with topological and algebraic-geometric structure on them. I call the latter more specific structure a 'model bundle', where the models are in the fibres and there is a moduli space in the base. I illustrate my second proposal in an example from quantum field theory. This view highlights the important role of quasi-dualities as local transition functions between fibres; dualities are recovered as global transition functions when the bundle is trivial. I discuss some philosophical issues that this geometric view of physical theories opens up, such as its realist interpretation.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy for locally squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.</description>

      <title>Entanglement degradation of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information science has been broadly explored in Einstein gravity and in various modified gravity theories; however, its extension to quantum gravity settings remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$, the mode frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\tilde{\zeta}$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics for a two-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics for a two-component ultrarelativistic plasma directly from kinetic theory. Starting with the Boltzmann--Vlasov equation and using the 14-moment approximation in the Landau frame, we obtain coupled evolution equations for the charge diffusion four-current and the shear-stress tensor. Benchmarking against the usual Israel-Stewart type relaxation form shows that this simplified description is accurate for small viscosity to entropy ($\eta/s$) ratio, vanishing magnetic field, and not so strong electric field. Outside this regime the dynamics depart in a controlled way, i.e., strong electric fields introduce nonlinear back-reaction that delays and reduces current peaks, and a sizable shear-stress is produced even without a flow profile.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bound State Perturbations Inside Black Holes and Isospectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bound state solutions for the polar perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that for a given value of the spherical harmonic index $\ell$, there are a total of $\ell-1$ bound states for polar perturbations. We show both analytically and numerically that the spectrum of $\ell-2$ of these perturbations coincides exactly with the spectrum of axial perturbations. Consequently, the isospectrality between the bound states of axial and polar perturbations in the interior of the black hole is preserved. Furthermore, the additional mode found in the spectrum of polar perturbations is the algebraically special mode, which also furnishes the ground state of polar perturbations. It is shown that the spectrum of the highly excited states is equally spaced, which, in the semi-classical approximation, yields the black hole area quantization $\Delta A = 16 \pi l_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$.</description>

      <title>Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>Ghost instabilities and strong coupling in quadratic non-metricity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities and/ or propagates more degrees of freedom than in the Minkowski limit, signalling strong coupling. There are two notable exceptions: the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) and the transverse-diffeomorphism-invariant gravity subclass, both of which are supplemented by the parity-violating operator. However, since the parity-violating term explicitly breaks (transverse) diffeomorphism invariance, we show, using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, that the parity-violating extension of STEGR propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent dynamics of quasiclassical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.</description>
