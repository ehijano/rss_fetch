      <title>On Information Transfer and Symmetry Breaking in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach to investigate symmetry breaking in dynamical systems. In particular, we use the notion of information transfer, which provides a measure of the entropy transfer between any pair of observables in a system, to predict symmetry breaking. We show that as a system loses symmetry, its trajectories \emph{slow down} and its Shannon entropy increases. This connection enables us to use information transfer to predict the onset of symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework in detecting different forms of symmetry breaking using illustrative examples, including Dynamical Symmetry Breaking (DSB), Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Mean Values at Hopf Points and Oscillation-Induced Gain Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a result concerning the mean value of orbits emerging from Hopf bifurcations. We then apply this result to identify a new phenomenon termed {\it oscillation-induced gain modulation}. A Hopf bifurcation of a system $\dot{x} = f(x; \alpha)$ with parameter $\alpha$ is characterized by the emergence of a limit cycle with an amplitude increasing from zero, coinciding with a stability change of an equilibrium $x_0(\alpha)$ when $\alpha$ passes a critical value $\alpha^*$. This bifurcation is associated with the real part of a single eigenpair $\lambda = \mu(\alpha) \pm i \omega(\alpha)$ of the linearized system crossing zero: $\mu(\alpha^*) = 0$, $\mu'(\alpha^*) \neq 0$. We establish a result concerning the temporal mean of the oscillation cycle over the period $T$ of oscillation: $\langle x \rangle_{\alpha} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^{T} x(t; \alpha) dt $. We set the mean to be $\langle x \rangle_{\alpha} = x_0(\alpha)$ when the equilibrium has no surrounding limit cycle. However, when a limit cycle exists, we show that that the deviation of the mean from the equilibrium is expressible as $ \langle x \rangle_{\alpha} - x_0(\alpha) = K \mu(\alpha) + \mathcal{O}(\mu(\alpha)^2)$. That is, the mean value deviates from the equilibrium's location in proportion to $\mu(\alpha)$, with a mean deviation determined by the vector quantity $K(\alpha) \mu(\alpha) $ that depends on the tensors of $f$ up to third-order. If we consider $\alpha$ to be an input to the model, and the mean $\langle x \rangle_{\alpha} $ as the output, then the mean deviation $K \mu(\alpha)$ introduces a discontinuity to the cycle mean gain $\frac{d \langle x \rangle_{\alpha}}{d\alpha}$ at the bifurcation, which we term oscillation-induced gain modulation (OIGM). We the cycle mean deviation result for general Hopf points in two-dimensional and $n$-dimensional systems, as well as showcase several examples of OIGM.</description>

      <title>A flux-based approach for analyzing the disguised toric locus of reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems with polynomial right-hand sides are very important in various applications, e.g., in biochemistry and population dynamics. The mathematical study of these dynamical systems is challenging due to the possibility of multistability, oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. One important tool for this study is the concept of reaction systems, which are dynamical systems generated by reaction networks for some choices of parameter values. Among these, disguised toric systems are remarkably stable: they have a unique attracting fixed point, and cannot give rise to oscillations or chaotic dynamics. The computation of the set of parameter values for which a network gives rise to disguised toric systems (i.e., the disguised toric locus of the network) is an important but difficult task. We introduce new ideas based on network fluxes for studying the disguised toric locus. We prove that the disguised toric locus of any network $G$ is a contractible manifold with boundary, and introduce an associated graph $G^{\max}$ that characterizes its interior. These theoretical tools allow us, for the first time, to compute the full disguised toric locus for many networks of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper surveys our results on integrable billiards. We consider various models of billiards, including Birkhoff, outer, magnetic, and Minkowski billiards. Also, we discuss wire billiards and billiards in cones. For four models of convex plane billiards, we also discuss an isoperimetric-type inequality for the Mather $\beta$-function. We conclude with a section of open questions on this subject.</description>

      <title>Mixing cycles on triods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study cycles on \emph{triods} whose dynamics emulate those of a \emph{mixing map}, referred to as \emph{mixing cycles}. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a cycle on a \emph{triod} $Y$ to be \emph{mixing}. We further show that the rule governing the co-existence of periods of \emph{mixing} cycles of a map on a \emph{triod} induces a linear ordering of the natural numbers, which remains stable under small perturbations of the map. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of exceptional \emph{mixing} cycles on \emph{triods} whose \emph{rotation numbers} coincide with an endpoint of the corresponding \emph{forced rotation interval}.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ and $M$ be compact smooth manifolds and let $\Theta:\Omega\times M\to\Omega\times M$ be a $\mathcal C^{1+\alpha}$ skew-product diffeomorphism over an Axiom A base. We show that $\Theta$ has at most countably many ergodic hyperbolic measures of maximal relative entropy. When $\dim M=2$, if $\Theta$ has positive relative topological entropy, then $\Theta$ has at most countably many ergodic measures of maximal relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Connecting orbits for delay differential equations with unimodal feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of delay differential equations with unimodal feedback and describes the structure of certain unstable sets of stationary points and periodic orbits. These unstable sets consist of heteroclinic connections from stationary points and periodic orbits to stable stationary points, stable periodic orbits and some more complicated compact invariant sets.
  A prototype example is the Mackey--Glass type equation $y'(t)=-ay(t)+b \frac{y^2(t-1)}{1+y^n(t-1)}$ having three stationary solutions $0$, $\xi_{1,n}$ and $\xi_{2,n}$ with $0&lt;\xi_{1,n}&lt;\xi_{2,n}$, provided $b&gt;a&gt;0$, and $n$ is large. The 1-dimensional leading unstable set $W^u(\hat{\xi}_{1,n})$ of the stationary point $\hat{\xi}_{1,n}$ is decomposed into three disjoint orbits, $W^u(\hat{\xi}_{1,n})=W^{u,-}(\hat{\xi}_{1,n})\cup \{\hat{\xi}_{1,n}\} \cup W^{u,+}(\hat{\xi}_{1,n})$.. Here $\hat{\xi}_{1,n}$ is a constant function in the phase space with value $\xi_{1,n}$. $W^{u,-}(\hat{\xi}_{1,n})$ is a connecting orbit from $\hat{\xi}_{1,n}$ to $\hat{0}$. There exists a threshold value $b^*=b^*(a)&gt;a$ such that, in case $b\in (a,b^*)$, $W^{u,+}(\hat{\xi}_{1,n})$ connects $\hat{\xi}_{1,n}$ to $\hat{0}$; and in case $b&gt;b^*$, $W^{u,+}(\hat{\xi}_{1,n})$ connects $\hat{\xi}_{1,n}$ to a compact invariant set $\mathcal{A}_n$ not containing $\hat{0}$ and $\hat{\xi}_{1,n}$. Under additional conditions, there is a stable periodic orbit $\mathcal{O}^n$ with $\mathcal{A}_n= \mathcal{O}^n$. Analogous results are obtained for the 2-dimensional leading unstable sets $W^u(\mathcal{Q}^n)$ of periodic orbits $\mathcal{Q}^n$ close to $\hat{\xi}_{1,n}$, establishing connections from $\mathcal{Q}^n$ to $\mathcal{O}^n$.</description>

      <title>Integrating the enveloping technique with the expansion strategy to establish stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on finding one-dimensional maps that detect global stability in multidimensional maps. We consider various local and global stability techniques in discrete-time dynamical systems and discuss their advantages and limitations. Specifically, we navigate through the embedding technique, the expansion strategy, the dominance condition technique, and the enveloping technique to establish a unifying approach to global stability. We introduce the concept of strong local asymptotic stability (SLAS), then integrate what we call the expansion strategy with the enveloping technique to develop the enveloping technique for two-dimensional maps, which allows to give novel global stability results. Our results make it possible to verify global stability geometrically for two-dimensional maps. We provide several illustrative examples to elucidate our concepts, bolster our theory, and demonstrate its application.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of the Wedding cake type surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hausdorff dimension of fractal interpolation surfaces (FISs) over a triangular domain. These FISs are known as `wedding cake surfaces'. These surfaces are the attractor of some deterministic self-affine iterated function systems (IFS) on $\mathbb{R}^3$ generated by a fractal interpolation algorithm. Due to the recent seminal result of Rapaport (Adv. Math. 449 (2024) 109734), the dimension theory of self-affine IFS on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is known whenever the IFS is strongly irreducible and proximal. However, the self-affine IFSs associated with FIS are not strongly irreducible. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the self-affine set (or FIS) is the same as the affinity dimension outside a set of scaling parameters with zero Lebesgue measure. Lastly, by computing the overlapping number for the associated Furstenberg IFS, we determine the Hausdorff dimension for every type of scaling parameter in a certain range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Rectangular Shrinking Targets on Self-Similar Carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the shrinking target problem by Hill and Velani in 1995 there has been a surge of interest in the area. In this paper we consider the case where the target is a rectangle, rather than a ball, and the underlying space is a self-similar carpet. We calculate the exact Hausdorff dimension of the resulting shrinking target set. Interestingly the Hausdorff dimension depends on the centre of the target, a condition uncommon in most other shrinking target type problems. This extends a theorem of Wang and Wu [Theorem 12.1, Math. Ann. 2021].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show ergodicity of (asymmetric) lemon billiards, billiard tables that are the intersection of two circles of which one contains the centers of both. These do not satisfy the Wojtkowski criteria for hyperbolicity, but we establish \emph{uniform} expansion of vectors in an invariant cone family and alignment of singularity curves. Both of these are difficult, and the approach to the latter seems new. Together, these properties imply ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the isomorphism of ergodic measure-preserving transformations is not Borel reducible to the relation induced by the conjugacy action of the full group of an ergodic measure-preserving transformation on itself. This answers a question of Le Ma\^{i}tre in the negative and gives a positive indication towards a conjecture of Sabok. In fact, we prove that the isomorphism of ergodic measure-preserving transformation is unbalanced, which answers another question of Le Ma\^{i}tre in the positive.</description>

      <title>Achieving Universal Approximation and Universal Interpolation via Nonlinearity of Control Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant connection exists between the controllability of dynamical systems and the approximation capabilities of neural networks, where residual networks and vanilla feedforward neural networks can both be regarded as numerical discretizations of the flow maps of dynamical systems. Leveraging the expressive power of neural networks, prior works have explored various control families $\mathcal{F}$ that enable the flow maps of dynamical systems to achieve either the universal approximation property (UAP) or the universal interpolation property (UIP). For example, the control family $\mathcal{F}_\text{ass}({\mathrm{ReLU}})$, consisting of affine maps together with a specific nonlinear function ReLU, achieves UAP; while the affine-invariant nonlinear control family $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{aff}}(f)$ containing a nonlinear function $f$ achieves UIP. However, UAP and UIP are generally not equivalent, and thus typically need to be studied separately with different techniques. In this paper, we investigate more general control families, including $\mathcal{F}_\text{ass}(f)$ with nonlinear functions $f$ beyond ReLU, the diagonal affine-invariant family $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{diag}}(f)$, and UAP for orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms under the uniform norm. We show that in certain special cases, UAP and UIP are indeed equivalent, whereas in the general case, we introduce the notion of local UIP (a substantially weaker version of UIP) and prove that the combination of UAP and local UIP implies UIP. In particular, the control family $\mathcal{F}_\text{ass}({\mathrm{ReLU}})$ achieves the UIP.</description>

      <title>Detecting Invariant Manifolds in ReLU-Based RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Kac Ring Model with switching scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized version of the Kac ring model in which particles are of two types, black and white. Black particles modify the environment through which all particles move, thereby inducing indirect and potentially long-range interactions among them. Unlike the inert scatterers of Kac's original model, the scatterers in our setting possess internal states that change upon interaction with black particles and can be interpreted as energy levels of the environment. This makes the model self-consistent, as it incorporates a form of particle interactions, mediated by the environment, that drives the system toward some kind of stationary state. Although indirect and long-range interactions do not necessarily promote thermodynamic states, interactions are necessary for energy to be shared among the elementary constituents of matter, enabling the establishment of equipartition, which is a prerequisite for defining temperature. Therefore, our model is one step forward in this direction, elucidating the role of interactions and energy exchange. We prove that any initial state of the system converges to a time periodic state (i.e. a phase space orbit) and describe basins of attraction for some of such asymptotic periodic states.</description>

Abstract: In a closed fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold M, the inclusion of a fiber S, with S and M lifted to the universal covers gives an exponentially distorted embedding of the hyperbolic plane into hyperbolic 3-space. Nevertheless, Cannon and Thurston showed that there is a map from the circle at infinity of the hyperbolic plane to the 2-sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space. The Cannon-Thurston map is surjective, finite-to-one, and gives a space-filling curve. Here we prove that many natural measures on the circle when pushed forward by the Cannon-Thurston map become singular with respect to many natural measures on the 2-sphere. The circle measures we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from fully supported random walks on the surface group. Whereas the measures on the sphere we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from geometric random walks on the 3-manifold group. The singularity of measures is ultimately derived from the following geometric result. We prove that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a pushforward measure asymptotically spends a definite proportion of its time close to a fiber. On the other hand, we show that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a natural measure on the sphere spends an asymptotically negligible proportion of its time close to a fiber. For a more restricted class of measures, namely the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures from geometric random walks on the surface group, we also prove an effective result for the proportion of time spent close to a fiber. To this end, we give precise descriptions if quasi-geodesics in the Cannon-Thurston metric, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraicity of non-abundant foliations and abundance for adjoint foliated structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming the abundance conjecture in dimension $d$, we establish a non-algebraicity criterion of foliations: any log canonical foliation of rank $\le d$ with $\nu\neq\kappa$ is not algebraically integrable, answering question of Ambro--Cascini--Shokurov--Spicer. Under the same hypothesis, we prove abundance for klt algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures of dimension $\le d$ and show the existence of good minimal models or Mori fiber spaces. In particular, when $d=3$, all these results hold unconditionally.
  Using similar arguments, we solve a problem proposed by Lu and Wang on abundance of surface adjoint foliated structures that are not necessarily algebraically integrable.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Schwarz Scheme for Linear-Quadratic Programs in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimize-then-discretize framework for solving linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCP) governed by time-inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our method employs a modified overlapping Schwarz decomposition based on the Pontryagin Minimum Principle, partitioning the temporal domain into overlapping intervals and independently solving Hamiltonian systems in continuous time. We demonstrate that the convergence is ensured by appropriately updating the boundary conditions of the individual Hamiltonian dynamics. The cornerstone of our analysis is to prove that the exponential decay of sensitivity (EDS) exhibited in discrete-time OCPs carries over to the continuous-time setting. Unlike the discretize-then-optimize approach, our method can flexibly incorporate different numerical integration methods for solving the resulting Hamiltonian two-point boundary-value subproblems, including adaptive-time integrators. A numerical experiment on a linear-quadratic OCP illustrates the practicality of our approach in broad scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Monotone Traveling Waves of the Weak Competition Lotka-Volterra System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate traveling wave solutions in the two-species reaction-diffusion Lotka-Volterra competition system under weak competition. For the strict weak competition regime $(b&lt;a&lt;1/c,\,d&gt;0)$, we construct refined upper and lower solutions combined with the Schauder fixed point theorem to establish the existence of traveling waves for all wave speeds $s\geq s^*:=\max\{2,2\sqrt{ad}\}$, and provide verifiable sufficient conditions for the emergence of non-monotone waves. Such conditions for non-monotonic waves have not been explicitly addressed in previous studies. It is interesting to point out that our result for non-monotone waves also hold for the critical speed case $s=s^*$. In addition, in the critical weak competition case $(b&lt;a=1/c,\,d&gt;0)$, we rigorously prove, for the first time, the existence of front-pulse traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of the Random Ordinate Method for Mitigating the Ray Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is widely used for velocity discretization in radiative transport simulations. However, DOM tends to exhibit the ray effect when the velocity discretization is not sufficiently refined, a limitation that is well documented. To counter this, we have developed the Random Ordinates Method (ROM) by integrating randomness into the velocity discretization, which mitigates the ray effect without incurring additional computational costs. ROM partitions the velocity space into n cells, selects a random ordinate from each cell, and solves a DOM system with these ordinates. It leverages the average of multiple samples to achieve a higher convergence order, especially for solutions with low regularity in the velocity variable. In this work, we provide a detailed convergence analysis for ROM, focusing on bias and single-run errors. This analysis is crucial for determining the necessary mesh size and the optimal number of samples required to attain a specified level of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: By benefit of Pesin's method to prove ergodicity with respect to Lebesgue measure for ordinary dynamical systems, we conclude ergodicity (resp. term-ergodicity) for some action semigroups with respect to volume measure (resp. quasi measure). To this aim, the main tool is the theory of local ergodicity.</description>

Abstract: A rational map $f:\widehat{\mathbb{C}}\to\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ on the Riemann sphere $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ is called critically fixed if each critical point of $f$ is fixed under $f$. In this article, we study the properties of a combinatorial invariant, called the Tischler graph, associated with such a map. We show that the Tischler graph of a critically fixed rational map is always connected, establishing a conjecture made by Kevin Pilgrim. This result allows us to solve two classical open problems in rational dynamics in the setting of critically fixed rational maps, namely the combinatorial classification problem and the global curve attractor problem. In particular, we prove that there is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between the conjugacy classes of critically fixed rational maps and the isomorphism classes of connected planar embedded graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this work we develop a well-defined theory of orbit spaces for piecewise smooth vector fields (PSVFs). This approach is inspired by the techniques already used in the study of endomorphisms, namely inverse limit analysis, and has been used before for PSVFs. We then apply the construction of our theory to understanding transitivity in PSVFs. Our results prove that the known examples of transitive PSVFs in the literature, the bean model and the sphere model, are indeed transitive in the orbit space.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in random networks of identical phase oscillators: A graphon approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators have been used to model circadian rhythms, flashing fireflies, Josephson junction arrays, high-voltage electric grids, and many other kinds of self-organizing systems. Recently, several authors have sought to understand how coupled oscillators behave when they interact according to a random graph. Here we consider interaction networks generated by a graphon model known as a $W$-random network, and examine the dynamics of an infinite number of identical phase oscillators. We show that with sufficient regularity on $W$, the solution to the dynamical system over a $W$-random network of size $n$ converges in the $L^{\infty}$ norm to the solution of the infinite graphon system, with high probability as $n\rightarrow\infty$. We leverage this convergence result to explore synchronization for two classes of identical phase oscillators on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. This result suggests a framework for studying synchronization properties in large but finite random networks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Geometric Structure of Neural Networks and Neural ODEs via Morse Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides classical feed-forward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) have gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated with a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps an affine linear transformation of the input to an affine linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that, depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller than or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that except for a Lebesgue measure zero set in the weight space, each critical point is non-degenerate if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the affine linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and infinite depth cases. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding and universal approximation, i.e., on the exact and approximate representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper refined and introduced some notations (namely attractors, physical attractors, proper attractors, topologically exact and topologically mixing) within the context of relations. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions, including that the phase space of a topologically exact system is an attractor for its inverse, and vice versa, and that a system is topologically mixing if and only if its phase space is a physical attractor. Through iterated function systems (IFSs), we illustrate classes of non-trivial topologically mixing and topologically exact IFSs. Additionally, we use IFSs to provide an example of topologically mixing system, generated by finite of homeomorphisms on a compact metric space, that is not topologically exact. These findings connect topological properties with attractor types, providing deeper insights into the long-term dynamics of such systems.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretization method for simulating the radiative transport equation. However, the ray effect is a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests that exhibit the ray effect, we observe low regularity in the velocity variable of the solution. To address this issue, we propose a Random Ordinate Method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared to other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) For benchmark tests that exhibit ray effect, the computational cost is lower than that of the DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing DOM-based code; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. A formal analysis is presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias. Numerical tests demonstrate the reduction in computational cost compared to DOM, as well as its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a tutorial about uncertainty quantification (UQ) for those who have no background but are interested in learning more in this area. It exploits many very simple examples, which are understandable to undergraduates, to present the ideas of UQ. Topics include characterizing uncertainties using information theory, UQ in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, UQ via data assimilation, the role of uncertainty in diagnostics, and UQ in advancing efficient modeling. The surprisingly simple examples in each topic explain why and how UQ is essential. Both MATLAB and Python codes are made available for these simple examples.</description>

Abstract: We seek periodic trajectories of a system of multiple mutually repelling electrons on a half-line, with an attractive nucleus sitting at the origin. We adopt a variational viewpoint and study critical points of the associated Lagrange-action functional, by means of a modified Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory for manifolds with boundary. Additionally, when the charges of the electrons tend to zero, we show that frozen planet orbits converge to segments of a brake orbit for a Kepler-type problem, establishing a strong analogy with the Schubart orbits of the gravitational $n$-body problem.</description>

      <title>A Martingale-Free Introduction to Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conditional Gaussian nonlinear system (CGNS) is a broad class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. Given the trajectories for a subset of state variables, the remaining follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite the conditionally linear structure, the CGNS exhibits strong nonlinearity, thus capturing many non-Gaussian characteristics observed in nature through its joint and marginal distributions. Desirably, it enjoys closed analytic formulae for the time evolution of its conditional Gaussian statistics, which facilitate the study of data assimilation and other related topics. In this paper, we develop a martingale-free approach to improve the understanding of CGNSs. This methodology provides a tractable approach to proving the time evolution of the conditional statistics by deriving results through time discretization schemes, with the continuous-time regime obtained via a formal limiting process as the discretization time-step vanishes. This discretized approach further allows for developing analytic formulae for optimal posterior sampling of unobserved state variables with correlated noise. These tools are particularly valuable for studying extreme events and intermittency and apply to high-dimensional systems. Moreover, the approach improves the understanding of different sampling methods in characterizing uncertainty. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a physics-constrained, triad-interaction climate model with cubic nonlinearity and state-dependent cross-interacting noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a compact three-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold of strictly 1/4-pinched negative sectional curvature, we establish exponential mixing of the frame flow with respect to the normalized volume. More generally this result extends to a class of torus extensions of Anosov flows, subject to assumptions on the Brin transitivity group and the smoothness of the stable subbundle. Our approach is based on a simplified dynamical model for studying the extension flow, constructed via a Young tower of the underlying Anosov flow. Exponential mixing is then obtained through a strengthened Dolgopyat type estimate on the corresponding transfer operators.</description>

Abstract: Generalizing the classification approach described for transitive Anosov flows in dimension 3 in a previous preprint of the author, in this paper we describe a method for classifying (not necessarily transitive) pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds up to orbital equivalence. To every pseudo-Anosov flow $\Phi$ (with no 1-prongs) on $M^3$ is associated a bifoliated plane $\mathcal{P}$ endowed with an action of $\pi_1(M)$. It is known that the previous action characterizes $\Phi$ up to orbital equivalence and admits infinitely many Markovian families (i.e. collections of rectangles in $\mathcal{P}$ generalizing the notion of Markov partition for group actions on the plane). Our goal in this paper consists in showing that :
  1) if $\mathcal{R}$ is a Markovian family of $\Phi$, the number of orbits of rectangles of $\mathcal{R}$ and their pattern of intersection can be encoded by a finite combinatorial object, called a geometric type, which describes completely $\Phi$ up to Dehn-Goodman-Fried surgeries on a specific finite set $\Gamma$ of periodic orbits of $\Phi$
  2) our previous choices of surgeries on $\Gamma$ can be read as sequences of rectangles in $\mathcal{R}$ and can be encoded by finite combinatorial objects, called cycles
  3) a geometric type with cycles of $\mathcal{R}$ describes the original flow $\Phi$ up to orbital equivalence
  Several of the above results will be stated and proven in a slightly more general setting involving strong Markovian actions on the plane. Finally, due to the lack of bibliographic references on pseudo-Anosov flows in dimension 3, in the first part of the paper we provide an introduction to pseudo-Anosov flow theory containing several useful results for our classification approach together with their proofs.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of reduced $C^*$-algebras associated with higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first examples of higher-rank lattices whose reduced $C^{*}$-algebras satisfy strict comparison, stable rank one, selflessness, uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang--Su algebra, and allow explicit computations of the Cuntz semigroup. This resolves a question raised in recent groundbreaking work of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell, in which they exhibited a large class of finitely generated non-amenable groups satisfying these properties. Our proof relies on quantitative estimates in projective dynamics, crucially using the exponential mixing for diagonalizable flows. As a result, we obtain an effective mixed-identity-freeness property, which, combined with V. Lafforgue's rapid decay theorem, yields the desired conclusions.</description>
