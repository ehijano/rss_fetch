      <title>On the classification of multiprojective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a positive integer $n$ and a partition $(n_1,\ldots,n_r)$ of $n$, one can consider the $n$-dimensional multiprojective space $\mathbb{P}^{n_1}\times \cdots \times \mathbb{P}^{n_r}$ corresponding to that partition. In this paper, we classify these multiprojective spaces. To be precise, we prove that given any two distinct partitions of any positive integer $n$, corresponding multiprojective spaces are not isomorphic using a decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Projective hypersurfaces in tropical scheme theory I: the Macaulay ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A "tropical ideal" is an ideal in the idempotent semiring of tropical polynomials that is also, degree by degree, a tropical linear space. We introduce a construction based on transversal matroids that canonically extends any principal ideal to a tropical ideal. We call this the Macaulay tropical ideal. It has a universal property: any other extension of the given principal ideal to a tropical ideal with the expected Hilbert function is a weak image of the Macaulay tropical ideal. For each $n\geq 2$ and $d\geq 1$ our construction yields a non-realizable degree $d$ hypersurface scheme in $\mathbb{P}^n$. Maclagan-Rinc\'on produced a non-realizable line in $\mathbb{P}^n$ for each $n$, and for $(d,n)=(1,2)$ the two constructions agree. An appendix by Mundinger compares the Macaulay construction with another method for canonically extending ideals to tropical ideals.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of GKM graphs and regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regular semisimple Hessenberg variety $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is a smooth subvariety of the full flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ associated with a regular semisimple matrix $S$ of order $n$ and a function $h$ from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ to itself satisfying a certain condition. We show that when $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is connected and not the entire space $\mathrm{Fl}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, the reductive part of the identity component $\mathrm{Aut}^0(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ of $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is an algebraic torus of dimension $n-1$ and $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))/\mathrm{Aut}^0(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ or $\mathfrak{S}_n\rtimes \{\pm 1\}$, where $\mathfrak{S}_n$ is the symmetric group of degree $n$. As a byproduct of our argument, we show that $\mathrm{Aut}(X)/\mathrm{Aut}^0(X)$ is a finite group for any projective GKM manifold $X$.</description>

      <title>Geometry of non-classical period domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a conjecture of Griffiths about vanishing of the zeroth cohomology groups of locally homogeneous vector bundles on compact quotients of non-classical period domains, and construct a new $G_\R$-invariant complex structure on any non-classical period domain $D=G_\R/V$ with $G_\R$ of Hermitian type. Various geometric and algebraic characterizations of non-classical period domains and several geometric applications on their compact quotients are deduced as consequences of our results.</description>

      <title>A new proof of the Bondal-Orlov reconstruction using Matsui spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2005, Balmer defined the ringed space $\operatorname{Spec}_\otimes \mathcal{T}$ for a given tensor triangulated category, while in 2023, the second author introduced the ringed space $\operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \mathcal{T}$ for a given triangulated category. In the algebro-geometric context, these spectra provided several reconstruction theorems using derived categories. In this paper, we prove that $\operatorname{Spec}_{\otimes_X^\mathbb{L}} \operatorname{Perf} X$ is an open ringed subspace of $\operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \operatorname{Perf} X$ for a quasi-projective variety $X$. As an application, we provide a new proof of the Bondal-Orlov and Ballard reconstruction theorems in terms of these spectra.
  Recently, the first author introduced the Fourier-Mukai locus $\operatorname{Spec}^\mathsf{FM} \operatorname{Perf} X$ for a smooth projective variety $X$, which is constructed by gluing Fourier-Mukai partners of $X$ inside $\operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \operatorname{Perf} X$. As another application of our main theorem, we demonstrate that $\operatorname{Spec}^\mathsf{FM} \operatorname{Perf} X$ can be viewed as an open ringed subspace of $\operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \operatorname{Perf} X$. As a result, we show that all the Fourier-Mukai partners of an abelian variety $X$ can be reconstructed by topologically identifying the Fourier-Mukai locus within $\operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \operatorname{Perf} X$.</description>

      <title>Simple obstructions and cone reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Deligne-Mumford stack locally of finite type over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero. We show that the intrinsic normal cone $C_X$ of $X$ is supported in the subcone $\mathbb{V}(\Omega_X[-1])$ ($h^1/h^0((\Omega^1_X)^\vee)$) of its intrinsic normal sheaf $N_X$. This leads to an alternative proof of cone reduction by cosections for $C_X$. We also discuss vanishing of simple obstructions under the Buchweitz-Flenner semiregularity map for sheaves.</description>

      <title>Construction of birational trilinear volumes via tensor rank criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide effective methods to construct and manipulate trilinear birational maps $\phi:(\mathbb{P}^1)^3\dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^3$ by establishing a novel connection between birationality and tensor rank. These yield four families of nonlinear birational transformations between 3D spaces that can be operated with enough flexibility for applications in computer-aided geometric design. More precisely, we describe the geometric constraints on the defining control points of the map that are necessary for birationality, and present constructions for such configurations. For adequately constrained control points, we prove that birationality is achieved if and only if a certain $2\times 2\times 2$ tensor has rank one. As a corollary, we prove that the locus of weights that ensure birationality is $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. Additionally, we provide formulas for the inverse $\phi^{-1}$ as well as the explicit defining equations of the irreducible components of the base loci. Finally, we introduce a notion of "distance to birationality" for trilinear rational maps, and explain how to continuously deform birational maps.</description>

      <title>Log-Noetherian functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the class of \emph{Log-Noetherian} (LN) functions. These are holomorphic solutions to algebraic differential equations (in several variables) with logarithmic singularities. We prove an upper bound on the number of solutions for systems of LN equations, resolving in particular Khovanskii's conjecture for Noetherian functions. Consequently, we show that the structure ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN}$ generated by LN-functions, as well as its expansion ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$, are effectively o-minimal: definable sets in these structures admit effective bounds on their complexity in terms of the complexity of the defining formulas.
  We show that ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$ contains the horizontal sections of regular flat connections with quasiunipotent monodromy over algebraic varieties. It therefore contains the universal covers of Shimura varieties and period maps of polarized variations of $\mathbb Z$-Hodge structures. We also give an effective Pila-Wilkie theorem for ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$-definable sets. Thus ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$ can be used as an effective variant of ${\mathbb R}_\text{an,exp}$ in the various applications of o-minimality to arithmetic geometry and Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Counter-examples to Gamma conjecture I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Gamma conjecture I and its underlying Conjecture $\mathcal{O}$ for the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles $X_n=\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{P}^{n}}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{O}(n))$ with $n\ge 3$. We show that Conjecture $\mathcal{O}$ does not hold if $n$ is odd, and that Gamma conjecture I does not hold if $n$ is even. Led by this example, we propose modifications for Gamma conjecture I, discuss Gamma conjecture I over the Kahler moduli space, and identify the corresponding principal asymptotic class.</description>

      <title>Action of Weyl group on equivariant K-theory of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the action of the Weyl group of a semi simple linear group $G$ on cohomological and K-theoretic invariants of the generalized flag variety $G/B$. We study the automorphism $s_i$, induced by the reflection in the simple root, on the equivariant $K$-theory ring $K_T(G/B)$ using divided difference operators. Using the localization theorem for torus action and Borel presentation for the equivariant K-theory ring, we calculate the formula for this automorphism. Moreover, we expand this formula in the basis consisting of structure sheaves classes of Schubert varieties. We provide effective formula (applying properties of Weyl groups) for the approximation of this expansion, more specifically for the part corresponding to Schubert varieties with the fixed dimension, which in the case of $G$ being a special linear group is more exact. Finally, we discuss the above-mentioned formula in the basis of motivic Chern classes of Schubert varieties.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible quasihomogeneus singularities and their Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the classification of quasihomogeneus singularities, any polynomial $f$ defining such singularity has a decomposition $f = f_\kappa + f_{add}$. The polynomial $f_\kappa$ is of the certain form while $f_{add}$ is only restricted by the condition that the singularity of $f$ should be isolated. The polynomial $f_{add}$ is zero if and only if $f$ is invertible, and in the non-invertible case $f_{add}$ is arbitrary complicated. In this paper we investigate all possible polynomials $f_{add}$ for a given non-invertible $f$. For a given $f_\kappa$ we introduce the specific small collection of monomials that build up $f_{add}$ such that the polynomial $f = f_\kappa + f_{add}$ defines an isolated quasihomogeneus singularity. If $(f,\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z})$ is Landau-Ginzburg orbifold with such non-invertible polynomial $f$, we provide the quasihomogeneus polynomial $\bar{f}$ such that the orbifold equivalence $(f,\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z}) \sim (\bar{f}, \{id\})$ holds. We also give the explicit isomorphism between the corresponding Frobenius algebras.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ Hodge theory for bounded subanalytic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded subanalytic submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$, possibly admitting singularities within its closure, we study the cohomology of $L^p$ differential forms having an $L^p$ exterior differential (in the sense of currents) and satisfying Dirichlet or Neumann condition. We show an $L^p$ Hodge decomposition theorem, an $L^p$ de Rham theorem, as well as a Lefschetz duality theorem between $L^p$ and $L^{p'}$ forms (with $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p'}=1$) in the case where $p$ is large or close to $1$. This is achieved by proving that de Rham's pairing between complementary $L^p$ differential forms induces a pairing between cohomology classes which is nondegenerate (for such $p$). The main difficulty to carry it out is to show the density (in Sobolev spaces of differential forms) of forms that vanish near some singularities and are smooth up to the closure of the underlying manifold in the case $p$ large (Theorem 4.1). This result, which is of independent interest, also makes it possible to give a trace theorem that leads us to some explicit characterizations of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions in terms of traces and residues.</description>

      <title>The interpolation problem: When can you pass a curve of a given type through N random points in space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpolation problem is a natural and fundamental question whose roots trace back to ancient Greece. The story is long and rich, with many chapters, and a complete solution has been obtained only recently. Exploring it leads us on a tour through a number of general themes in geometry. This concrete problem motivates fundamental concepts such as moduli spaces and their properties, deformation theory, normal bundles, and more. Questions about smooth objects lead us to consider singular (non-smooth) objects, and in fact these smooth objects are studied by instead focusing on somehow simpler "non-smooth" objects, and then deforming them.</description>

      <title>On the configurations of four spheres supporting the vertices of a tetrahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reformulation of the three circles theorem of Johnson with distance coordinates to the vertices of a triangle is explicitly represented in a polynomial system and solved by symbolic computation. A similar polynomial system in distance coordinates to the vertices of a tetrahedron $T \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is introduced to represent the configurations of four spheres of radius $R^*$, which intersect in one point, each sphere containing three vertices of $T$ but not the fourth one. This problem is related to that of computing the largest value $r$ for which the set of vertices of $T$ is an $r$-body. For triangular pyramids we completely describe the set of geometric configurations with the required four balls of radius $R^*$. The solutions obtained by symbolic computation show that triangular pyramids are splitted into two different classes: in the first one $R^*$ is unique, in the second one three values $R^*$ there exist. The first class can be itself subdivided into two subclasses, one of which is related to the family of $r$-bodies.</description>

      <title>The $m$-step solvable anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K_\circ$ and $K_\bullet$ be mixed-characteristic local fields, and let $m$ be an integer $\geq 0$. For each $\square\in \{ \circ, \bullet \}$, let $K_{\square}^{m}$ denote the maximal $m$-step solvable extension of $K_{\square}$, and write $G_{K_\square}^{m}$ for the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the absolute Galois group $G_{K_\square}$ of $K_\square$; we equip $G_{K_\square}$ and its quotients with filtration defined by the ramification groups in upper numbering. It is known from the previous bi-anabelian result due to Mochizuki that the natural map from the set of field isomorphisms $K_\circ\to K_\bullet$ into the set of outer isomorphisms $G_{K_\circ} \to G_{K_\bullet}$ of filtered profinite groups is bijective; in particular, the isomorphism class of $K_\circ$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the filtered profinite group $G_{K_\circ}$. In this paper, we prove (with some mono-anabelian results) that the isomorphism class of $K_\circ^{m}$ (hence of $K_\circ$) is determined by the isomorphism class of $G_{K_\circ}^{m+2}$ as a filtered profinite group, and that the field isomorphism $K_\circ^m\to K_\bullet^m$ is determined functorially by the isomorphism $G_{K_\circ}^{m+3}\to G_{K_\bullet}^{m+3}$ of filtered profinite groups.</description>

      <title>Alcove walk models for parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections and branching to Levi subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes alcove walk models for intersections of Schubert varieties and partially semi-infinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian of a split reductive group (we call such intersections parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections). More precisely, we describe explicit cellular pavings of these intersections, indexed by certain positively-folded alcove walks. We prove a parametrization of the irreducible components of maximal possible dimension, in terms of alcove walks of maximal possible dimension. We then deduce a new combinatorial description of branching to Levi subgroups of irreducible highest weight representations, and in particular we give a new algorithm for computing the characters of such representations.</description>

Abstract: In a remarkable series of works, Guo, Phong, Song, and Sturm have obtained key uniform estimates for the Green's functions associated with certain K\"ahler metrics. In this note, we broaden the scope of their techniques by removing one of their assumptions and allowing the complex structure to vary. We apply our results to various families of canonical K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>Bounded geometry for PCF-special subvarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Calabi-Yau four folds with hybrid and recurrent neural network architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report the results of applying deep learning based on hybrid convolutional-recurrent and purely recurrent neural network architectures to the dataset of almost one million complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds (CICY4) to machine-learn their four Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$. In particular, we explored and experimented with twelve different neural network models, nine of which are convolutional-recurrent (CNN-RNN) hybrids with the RNN unit being either GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The remaining four models are purely recurrent neural networks based on LSTM. In terms of the $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$ prediction accuracies, at 72% training ratio, our best performing individual model is CNN-LSTM-400, a hybrid CNN-LSTM with the LSTM hidden size of 400, which obtained 99.74%, 98.07%, 95.19%, 81.01%, our second best performing individual model is LSTM-448, an LSTM-based model with the hidden size of 448, which obtained 99.74%, 97.51%, 94.24%, and 78.63%. These results were improved by forming ensembles of the top two, three or even four models. Our best ensemble, consisting of the top three models, achieved the accuracies of 99.80%, 98.40%, 95.80%, 83.02%. At 80% training ratio, the top two performing models LSTM-448 and LSTM-424 are both LSTM-based with the hidden sizes of 448 and 424. Compared with the 72% training ratio, there is a significant improvement of accuracies, which reached 99.85%, 98.66%, 96.26%, 84.77% for the best individual model and 99.88%, 98.91%, 96.96%, 86.78% for the best ensemble.</description>

      <title>Toric Sylvester forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11281v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure of the saturation of ideals generated by sparse homogeneous polynomials over a projective toric variety $X$ with respect to the irrelevant ideal of $X$. As our main results, we establish a duality property and make it explicit by introducing toric Sylvester forms, under a certain positivity assumption on $X$. In particular, we prove that toric Sylvester forms yield bases of some graded components of $I^{\text{sat}}/I$, where $I$ denotes an ideal generated by $n+1$ generic forms, $n$ is the dimension of $X$ and $I^{\text{sat}}$ the saturation of $I$ with respect to the irrelevant ideal of the Cox ring of $X$. Then, to illustrate the relevance of toric Sylvester forms we provide three consequences in elimination theory over smooth toric varieties: (1) we introduce a new family of elimination matrices that can be used to solve sparse polynomial systems by means of linear algebra methods, including overdetermined polynomial systems; (2) by incorporating toric Sylvester forms to the classical Koszul complex associated to a polynomial system, we obtain new expressions of the sparse resultant as a determinant of a complex; (3) we explote a new formula for computing toric residues of the product of two forms.</description>

      <title>Moduli of K3 families over $\mathbb{P}^1$, cycle spaces of IHS period domains, and deformations of complex-hyperk\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the spirit of the classical theory for K3 surfaces, we construct a Hausdorff fine moduli space for families of marked K3 surfaces over smooth rational curves in the K3 period domain. This moduli space admits an \'etale holomorphic map to the parameter space for such rational curves, which assumes the role of a period space for this moduli problem. Over an open subset containing all twistor cycles, we construct a family of such families that is a universal small deformation for every twistor family. Finally, small deformations of K3 twistor families are shown to induce complex-hyperk\"ahler metrics on members of the families via the original complex version of Penrose's Non-linear Graviton construction. This answers a question posed independently by Fels--Huckleberry--Wolf and Looijenga. Generalizations to higher-dimensional irreducible holomorphic-symplectic manifolds are studied throughout.</description>

      <title>Algebraization Techniques and Rigid-Analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First, we prove an algebraization result for rig-smooth algebras over a general noetherian ring; this positively answers the question raised in [Sta24, Tag 0GAX]. Then we prove a general partial algebraization result in non-archimedean geometry. The result says that we can always algebraize a geometrically reduced affinoid rigid-analytic space in "one direction" in an appropriate sense. As an application of this result, we show the remaining cases of the Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing for affinoid algebras, which were previously conjectured in [BM21, {\S}7]. This allows us to deduce a stronger version of the rigid-analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing Conjecture (see [Han20, Conj. 1.2]) over a field of characteristic 0. Using a completely different set of ideas, we also obtain a weaker version of this conjecture over a field of characteristic p&gt;0.</description>

      <title>Degrees of the Wasserstein Distance to Small Toric Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the closest point(s) on a statistical model from a given distribution in the probability simplex with respect to a fixed Wasserstein metric gives rise to a polyhedral norm distance optimization problem. There are two components to the complexity of determining the Wasserstein distance from a data point to a model. One is the combinatorial complexity that is governed by the combinatorics of the Lipschitz polytope of the finite metric to be used. Another is the algebraic complexity, which is governed by the polar degrees of the Zariski closure of the model. We find formulas for the polar degrees of rational normal scrolls and graphical models whose underlying graphs are star trees. Also, the polar degrees of the graphical models with four binary random variables where the graphs are a path on four vertices and the four-cycle, as well as for small, no-three-way interaction models, were computed. We investigate the algebraic degree of computing the Wasserstein distance to a small subset of these models. It was observed that this algebraic degree is typically smaller than the corresponding polar degree.</description>

Abstract: Voisin constructed self-rational maps of Calabi-Yau manifolds obtained as varieties of $r$-planes in cubic hypersurfaces of adequate dimension. This map has been thoroughly studied in the case $r=1$, which is the Beauville-Donagi case. In this paper, we compute the action of $\Psi$ on holomorphic forms for any $r$. For $r=2$, we compute the action of $\Psi$ on the Chow group of $0$-cycles, and confirm that it is as expected from the generalized Bloch conjecture.</description>

      <title>A refined Weyl character formula for comodules on $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be any commutative unital ring and let $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$ be the general linear group scheme on $A$ of rank $2$. We study the representation theory of $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$ and the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$, where $(V, \Delta)$ is the standard right comodule on $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. We prove a refined Weyl character formula for $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$. There is for any integer $d \geq 1$ a (canonical) refined weight space decomposition $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V) \cong \oplus_i \operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ where each direct summand $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ is a comodule on $N \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. Here $N$ is the schematic normalizer of the diagonal torus $T \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. We prove a character formula for the direct summands of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$ for any integer $d \geq 1$. This refined Weyl character formula implies the classical Weyl character formula. As a Corollary we get a refined Weyl character formula for the pull back $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V \otimes K)$ as a comodule on $\operatorname{GL}(2,K)$ where $K$ is any field. We also calculate explicit examples involving the symmetric powers, symmetric tensors and their duals. The refined weight space decomposition exists in general for group schemes such as $\operatorname{GL}(n,A)$ and $\operatorname{SL}(n,A)$. The study may have applications to the study of groups $G$ such as $\operatorname{SL}(n,k)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$ and quotients $G/H$ where $k$ is an arbitrary field (or a Dedekind domain) and $H \subseteq G$ is a closed subgroup. The refined weight space decomposition of $S_{\lambda}(V)$ has a relation with irreducible module over a field of positiv characteristic. In an example I prove it recovers the irreducible module $V(\lambda) \subsetneq S_{\lambda}(V)$.</description>

This will build up foundations for further study on some generalized cohomology of Frobenius modules and the corresponding generalized Iwasawa theory and generalized noncommutative Tamagawa number conjectures in the spirit of Burns-Flach-Fukaya-Kato and Nakamura (as well as certainly the original noncommutative Tamagawa number conjectures as observed by Pal-Z\'abr\'adi). We will work in the program proposed by Carter-Kedlaya-Z\'abr\'adi and after Pal-Z\'abr\'adi, and we will follow closely the approach from Kedlaya-Pottharst-Xiao to investigate the corresponding deformation of the generalized $p$-adic Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Modular Heights of Quaternionic Shimura Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove a formula expressing the modular height of a quaternionic Shimura curve over a totally real number field in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the Dedekind zeta function of the totally real number field. Our proof is based on the work of Yuan-Zhang-Zhang on the Gross-Zagier formula and the work of Yuan-Zhang on the averaged Colmez conjecture. All these works are in turn inspired by the Pioneering work of Gross-Zagier and some philosophies of Kudla's program.</description>

      <title>Some Generalizations of Mirzakhani's Recursion and Masur-Veech Volumes via Topological Recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Via Andersen-Borot-Orantin's geometric recursion, a twist of the topological recursion was proposed, and a recursion for the Masur-Veech polynomials was uncovered. The purpose of this article is to explore generalizations of Mirzakhani's recursion based on physical two-dimensional gravity models related to the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to provide an introduction to various realizations of topological recursion. For generalized Mirzakhani's recursions involving a Masur-Veech type twist, we derive Virasoro constraints and cut-and-join equations, and also show some computations of generalized volumes for the physical two-dimensional gravity models.</description>

      <title>Indicator functions, v-numbers and Gorenstein rings in the theory of projective Reed-Muller-type codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For projective Reed--Muller-type codes we give a global duality criterion in terms of the v-number and the Hilbert function of a vanishing ideal. As an application, we provide a global duality theorem for projective Reed--Muller-type codes over Gorenstein vanishing ideals, generalizing the known case where the vanishing ideal is a complete intersection. We classify self dual Reed-Muller-type codes over Gorenstein ideals using the regularity and a parity check matrix. For projective evaluation codes, we give a duality theorem inspired by that of affine evaluation codes. We show how to compute the regularity index of the $r$-th generalized Hamming weight function in terms of the standard indicator functions of the set of evaluation points.</description>

      <title>On schemes evinced by generalized additive decompositions and their regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and explicitly construct schemes evinced by generalized additive decompositions (GADs) of a given $d$-homogeneous polynomial $F$. We employ GADs to investigate the regularity of $0$-dimensional schemes apolar to $F$, focusing on those satisfying some minimality conditions. We show that irredundant schemes to $F$ need not be $d$-regular, unless they are evinced by special GADs of $F$. Instead, we prove that tangential decompositions of minimal length are always $d$-regular, as well as irredundant apolar schemes of length at most $2d+1$.</description>
