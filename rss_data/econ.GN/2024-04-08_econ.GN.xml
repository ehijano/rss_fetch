      <title>Recursive index for assessing value added of individual scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An aggregated recursive K-index is proposed as a new scientometric indicator of added value and scientific research output of individual publications. This index can be used instead of or in addition to the H-index (J.E. Hirsch. An index to quantify an individual's scientific research output, arXiv:physics/0508025). In particular, it is proposed to switch from a pure strategy for assessing the quality and effectiveness of R&amp;D using the H-index (Hirsch index) to a mixed strategy (in the context of publication activity as a combination of cooperative and noncooperative games) using the K-index on subnational and H-index on international or differentiated levels. In the context of a hybrid strategy of the scientist's payoff functions. This transition is correct and in demand for a number of national scientific systems with limited financial, material, infrastructural and linguistic (in terms of the English language) potential. Scientific systems with highly developed indigenous (autochthonous) characteristics are also needed in some scientific areas.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Economic Convergence Across the Americas: A Survival Analysis Approach to GDP per Capita Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By integrating survival analysis, machine learning algorithms, and economic interpretation, this research examines the temporal dynamics associated with attaining a 5 percent rise in purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita over a period of 120 months (2013-2022). A comparative investigation reveals that DeepSurv is proficient at capturing non-linear interactions, although standard models exhibit comparable performance under certain circumstances. The weight matrix evaluates the economic ramifications of vulnerabilities, risks, and capacities. In order to meet the GDPpc objective, the findings emphasize the need of a balanced approach to risk-taking, strategic vulnerability reduction, and investment in governmental capacities and social cohesiveness. Policy guidelines promote individualized approaches that take into account the complex dynamics at play while making decisions.</description>

      <title>Estimating Contagion Mechanism in Global Equity Market with Time-Zone Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a time-zone vector autoregression (VAR) model to investigate comovements in the global financial market. Analyzing daily data from 36 national equity markets, we explore the subprime and European debt crises using static analysis and the COVID-19 crisis through a rolling window method. Our study of comovements using VAR coefficients reveals a resonance effect in the global system. Findings on densities and assortativities suggest the existence of the transmission mechanism in all periods and abnormal structural changes during the crises. Strength analysis uncovers the information transmission mechanism across continents over normal and turmoil periods and emphasizes specific stock markets' unique roles. We examine dynamic continent strengths to demonstrate the contagion mechanism in the global equity market over an extended period. Incorporating the time-zone effect significantly enhances the VAR model's interpretability. Signed networks provide more information on global equity markets and better identifies critical contagion patterns than unsigned networks.</description>

      <title>Super Apps and the Digital Markets Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to ensure contestability and fairness in digital markets, particularly focusing on regulating Big Tech companies. The paper explores the DMA's capacity to address both current and future challenges in digital market contestability and fairness, spotlighting the trend towards platform integration and the potential rise of "super-apps" akin to WeChat and KakaoTalk. Specifically, it investigates WhatsApp, owned by Meta, as a gatekeeper that might expand its service offerings, integrating additional functionalities like AI and metaverse technologies. The paper discusses whether the DMA's obligations, such as mandated interoperability and data portability, can mitigate the emergent risks to market fairness and contestability from such integrations. Despite recognizing that the DMA has the potential to address many issues arising from platform integration, it suggests the necessity for adaptability and a complementary relationship with traditional antitrust law to ensure sustained contestability and fairness in evolving digital markets.</description>

      <title>Early Adoption of Generative AI by Global Business Leaders: Insights from an INSEAD Alumni Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How are new technologies like generative AI quickly adopted and used by executive and managerial leaders to create value in organizations? A survey of INSEAD's global alumni base revealed several intriguing insights into perceptions and engagements with generative AI across a broad spectrum of demographics, industries, and geographies. Notably, there's a prevailing optimism about the role of generative AI in enhancing productivity and innovation, as evidenced by the 90% of respondents being excited about its time-saving and efficiency benefits. Analysis revealed different attitudes about adoption and use across demographic variables. Younger respondents are significantly more excited about generative AI and more likely to be using it at work and in personal life than older participants. Those in Europe have a somewhat more distant view of generative AI than those in North America in Asia, in that they see the gains more likely to be captured by organizations than individuals, and are less likely to be using it in professional and personal contexts than those in North America and Asia. This may also be related to the fact that those in Europe are more likely to be working in Financial Services and less likely to be working in Information Technology industries than those in North America and Asia. Despite this, those in Europe are more likely to see AGI happening faster than those in North America, although this may reflect less interaction with generative AI in personal and professional contexts. These findings collectively underscore the complex and multifaceted perceptions of generative AI's role in society, pointing to both its promising potential and the challenges it presents.</description>

      <title>Gender Bias in Emerging New Research Topics: The Impact of COVID-19 on Women in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of new research opportunities on the long-standing under-representation of women in medical and academic leadership by assessing the impact of the emergence of COVID-19 as a new research topic in the life sciences on women's authorship. After collecting publication data from 2019 and 2020 on biomedical publications, where the position of first and last author is most important for future career development, we use the major Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms to identify the main research area of each publication and measure the relation of each paper to COVID-19. Using a Difference-in-Difference approach, we find that although the general female authorship trend is upwards, papers in areas related to COVID-19 are less likely to have a woman as first or last author compared to research areas not related to COVID-19. Conversely, new publication opportunities in the COVID-19 research field increase the proportion of women in middle, less-relevant, author positions. Stay-at-home mandates, journal importance, and access to new funds do not fully explain the drop in women's outcomes. The decline in female first authorship is related to the increase of teams in which both lead authors have no prior experience in the COVID-related research field. In addition, pre-existing publishing teams show reduced bias in female key authorship with respect to new teams specifically formed for COVID-related research. This suggests that opportunistic teams, transitioning into research areas with emerging interests, possess greater flexibility in choosing the primary and final authors, potentially reducing uncertainties associated with engaging in productions divergent from their past scientific experiences by excluding women scientists from key authorship positions.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Flexibility in Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexibility is a cornerstone of operations management, crucial to hedge stochasticity in product demands, service requirements, and resource allocation. In two-sided platforms, flexibility is also two-sided and can be viewed as the compatibility of agents on one side with agents on the other side. Platform actions often influence the flexibility on either the demand or the supply side. But how should flexibility be jointly allocated across different sides? Whereas the literature has traditionally focused on only one side at a time, our work initiates the study of two-sided flexibility in matching platforms. We propose a parsimonious matching model in random graphs and identify the flexibility allocation that optimizes the expected size of a maximum matching. Our findings reveal that flexibility allocation is a first-order issue: for a given flexibility budget, the resulting matching size can vary greatly depending on how the budget is allocated. Moreover, even in the simple and symmetric settings we study, the quest for the optimal allocation is complicated. In particular, easy and costly mistakes can be made if the flexibility decisions on the demand and supply side are optimized independently (e.g., by two different teams in the company), rather than jointly. To guide the search for optimal flexibility allocation, we uncover two effects, flexibility cannibalization, and flexibility abundance, that govern when the optimal design places the flexibility budget only on one side or equally on both sides. In doing so we identify the study of two-sided flexibility as a significant aspect of platform efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards a representative social cost of carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of estimates of the social cost of carbon use preference parameters calibrated to data for North America and Europe. We here use representative data for attitudes to time and risk across the world. The social cost of carbon is substantially higher in the global north than in the south. The difference is more pronounced if we count people rather than countries.</description>

      <title>The Minimum Wage as an Anchor: Effects on Determinations of Fairness by Humans and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the role of minimum wage as an anchor for judgements of the fairness of wages by both human subjects and artificial intelligence (AI). Through surveys of human subjects enrolled in the crowdsourcing platform Prolific.co and queries submitted to the OpenAI's language model GPT-3, I test whether the numerical response for what wage is deemed fair for a particular job description changes when respondents and GPT-3 are prompted with additional information that includes a numerical minimum wage, whether realistic or unrealistic, relative to a control where no minimum wage is stated. I find that the minimum wage influences the distribution of responses for the wage considered fair by shifting the mean response toward the minimum wage, thus establishing the minimum wage's role as an anchor for judgements of fairness. However, for unrealistically high minimum wages, namely $50 and $100, the distribution of responses splits into two distinct modes, one that approximately follows the anchor and one that remains close to the control, albeit with an overall upward shift towards the anchor. The anchor exerts a similar effect on the AI bot; however, the wage that the AI bot perceives as fair exhibits a systematic downward shift compared to human subjects' responses. For unrealistic values of the anchor, the responses of the bot also split into two modes but with a smaller proportion of the responses adhering to the anchor compared to human subjects. As with human subjects, the remaining responses are close to the control group for the AI bot but also exhibit a systematic shift towards the anchor. During experimentation, I noted some variability in the bot responses depending on small perturbations of the prompt, so I also test variability in the bot's responses with respect to more meaningful differences in gender and race cues in the prompt, finding anomalies in the distribution of responses.</description>

      <title>Productivity, Inputs Misallocation, and the Financial Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reevaluates the conventional approach to quantifying within-industry resource misallocation, typically measured by the dispersion of an input marginal product. My findings suggest that this statistic incorporates inherent productivity heterogeneity and idiosyncratic productivity shocks, irrespective of the input under scrutiny. Using balance sheet data from American and European manufacturing firms, I show that total factor productivity (TFP) volatility accounts for 7% of the variance in the marginal product of capital, 9% for labor, and 10% for material inputs. Consequently, this index, taken at face value, fails to identify policy-induced misallocation for any production input. To overcome this limitation, I propose a comparative analysis strategy driven by an identified policy variation. This approach allows the researcher to assess induced misallocation in relative terms whilst controlling for differences in TFP volatility. I show that the financial crisis had an uneven impact on the within-industry dispersion of the marginal product of capital across European nations, reflecting their differing financial sector maturity and suggesting the existence of financial misallocative frictions. The crisis did not affect the dispersion of the marginal product for other inputs.</description>

      <title>Zonal vs. Nodal Pricing: An Analysis of Different Pricing Rules in the German Day-Ahead Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European electricity market is based on large pricing zones with a uniform day-ahead price. The energy transition leads to shifts in supply and demand and increasing redispatch costs. In an attempt to ensure efficient market clearing and congestion management, the EU Commission has mandated the Bidding Zone Review (BZR) to reevaluate the configuration of European bidding zones. Based on a unique data set published in the context of the BZR, we compare various pricing rules for the German power market. We compare market clearing and pricing for national, zonal, and nodal models, including their generation costs and associated redispatch costs. Moreover, we investigate different non-uniform pricing rules and their economic implications for the German electricity market. Our results indicate that the differences in the average prices in different zones are small. The total costs across different configurations are similar and the reduction of standard deviations in prices is also small based on this data set. A nodal pricing rule leads to the lowest total costs. We also analyze the quality of different pricing rules and their differences with respect to the quality of the price signals and the necessary uplift payments. While the study focuses on Germany, the analysis is relevant beyond and feeds into the broader discussion about pricing rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security issuance through intermediaries is subject to informational and agency-related frictions. However, separating their effects on securities has been difficult. We estimate those effects separately using SPAC data. To that end, we identify "premium" investors who produce value-relevant information. Their participation is associated with lower liquidation risk and higher returns. In contrast, "non-premium" investors engage only in quid pro quo arrangements. They receive high returns from an intermediary (quid) for participating in weaker future deals initiated by that intermediary (quo). Thus, quid pro quo is not pure agency cost; it includes transfers enabling more firms to go public.</description>

      <title>Economic Complexity Limits Accuracy of Price Probability Predictions by Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the economic reasons why the predictions of price and return statistical moments in the coming decades, in the best case, will be limited by their averages and volatilities. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of price and return probabilities by Gaussian distributions. The economic origin of these restrictions lies in the fact that the predictions of the market-based n-th statistical moments of price and return for n=1,2,.., require the description of the economic variables of the n-th order that are determined by sums of the n-th degrees of values or volumes of market trades. The lack of existing models that describe the evolution of the economic variables determined by the sums of the 2nd degrees of market trades results in the fact that even predictions of the volatilities of price and return are very uncertain. One can ignore existing economic barriers that we highlight but cannot overcome or resolve them. The accuracy of predictions of price and return probabilities substantially determines the reliability of asset pricing models and portfolio theories. The restrictions on the accuracy of predictions of price and return statistical moments reduce the reliability and veracity of modern asset pricing and portfolio theories.</description>
