      <title>Fitness landscape for quantum state tomography from neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a direct connection between static structure factors and quantum ground states for two-spin interaction Hamiltonians was proven. This suggests the possibility of quantum state tomography from neutron scattering. Here, we investigate the associated fitness landscape numerically. We find a linear relationship between the mean square distances of the structure factors and the associated state overlaps, implying a well-behaved fitness landscape. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that the approach can be generalized to thermal equilibrium states. We also extend the arguments to the cases of applied magnetic fields and finite clusters.</description>

      <title>Dynamic orders of a Quantum Spin Liquid at Non-zero Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum spin liquid hosts massive quantum entanglement whose identification is one of the most significant problems in physics. Yet, its detection is known to be notoriously difficult because of featureless properties without a symmetry order parameter. Here, we demonstrate dynamic signatures of a quantum spin liquid state by investigating Kitaev's spin model on the hyper-honeycomb lattice, where a quantum spin liquid state is stabilized as a stable thermodynamic phase. The real-time dynamics of spin correlation function is obtained with the large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation. We find the onset of a characteristic oscillation in dynamic local spin correlation as entering the quantum spin liquid phase. Our results show that a quantum spin liquid may be characterized by a sharp growth of coherent spin dynamics of the system, which we name as a dynamic order. We further propose that a dynamic-order may naturally detect a featureless thermal phase transition, which has been reported in a class of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic linear Edelstein effect in non-collinear \ch{EuIn2As2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate \ch{EuIn2As2}, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and \textit{ab initio} calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the \textit{helical} and \textit{broken helical} phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the \textit{broken helical} phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.</description>

      <title>Evidence for incommensurate antiferromagnetism in nonsymmorphic UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection between nonsymmorphic symmetry and electronic correlations has emerged as a platform for topological Kondo semimetallic states and unconventional spin textures. Here we report the synthesis of nonsymmorphic UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ single crystals and their structural, electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties. UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically (AFM) below $T_N\simeq$ 161 K as evidenced by a sharp cusp in magnetic susceptibility, a second-order phase transition in specific heat, and an upturn in electrical resistivity, which suggests an incommensurate AFM structure that deviates from the A-type magnetism typically observed in this class of materials. Across $T_N$, Hall effect measurements reveal a change from electron-dominated to hole-dominated transport, which points to a sharp reconstruction in the electronic structure at $T_N$. Upon further cooling, a first-order transition is observed at $T_1 \simeq 30 $K in magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity but not in electrical resistivity or Hall measurements, which indicates a small change in the AFM structure that does not affect the electronic structure. Our specific heat data reveal a small Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma \simeq$13 mJmol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$), consistent with localized 5$f$ electrons. Our results indicate that UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ hosts weak electronic correlations and is likely away from a Kondo semimetallic state. Low-temperature magnetization measurements show that the AFM structure is remarkably stable to 160 kOe and does not undergo any field-induced transitions. Neutron diffraction and magnetization experiments at higher fields would be valuable to probe the presence of unconventional spin textures.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and heat transport of quantum spin liquid candidates NaYbS$_2$ and NaYbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ultralow-temperature thermodynamics and thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of the single-crystal rare-earth chalcogenides NaYbS$_2$ and NaYbSe$_2$, which have an ideal triangular lattice of the Yb$^{3+}$ ions and have been proposed to be quantum spin liquid candidates. The magnetic specific heat divided by temperature $C_{\rm{mag}}/T$ is nearly constant at $T &lt;$ 200 mK, which is indeed the indication of the gapless magnetic excitations with a constant density of states. However, we observe a vanishingly small residual term $\kappa_0/T$, which points to the absence of mobile fermionic excitations in these materials. Both the weak temperature dependence of $\kappa$ and the strong magnetic-field dependence of $\kappa$ suggest the significant scattering between the spinons and phonons, which actually supports the existence of gapless or tiny-gapped quantum spin liquid. Moreover, the $\kappa(B)/\kappa(0)$ isotherms show a series of field-induced magnetic transitions for $B \parallel a$, confirming the easy-plane anisotropy, which is consistent with the results of ac magnetic susceptibility. We expect our results to inspire further interests in the understanding of the spinon-phonon coupling in the spin liquid systems.</description>

      <title>Competing Orbital Magnetism and Superconductivity in electrostatically defined Josephson Junctions of Alternating Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within a single material system represents a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics. Van der Waals-based moir\'e superlattices provide an exceptional platform for exploring competing and coexisting broken symmetry states. Alternating twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) exhibits robust superconductivity at the magic angle of 1.57{\deg} and 1.3{\deg}, with suppression at intermediate twist angles. In this study, we investigate the intermediate regime and uncover evidence of orbital magnetism. As previously reported, superconductivity is suppressed near the charge neutrality point (CNP) and emerges at larger moir\'e fillings. Conversely, we find orbital magnetism most substantial near the CNP, diminishing as superconductivity develops. This complementary behavior is similarly observed in the displacement field phase space, highlighting a competitive interplay between the two phases. Utilizing gate-defined Josephson junctions, we probe orbital magnetism by electrostatically tuning the weak links into the magnetic phase, revealing an asymmetric Fraunhofer interference pattern. The estimated orbital ferromagnetic ordering temperature is approximately half the superconducting critical temperature, coinciding with the onset of Fraunhofer asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the observed orbital magnetism is driven by valley polarization and is distinct from the anomalous Hall effect reported at integer fillings in twisted graphene systems. These results offer insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Angle-Tuned Gross-Neveu Quantum Criticality in Twisted Bilayer Graphene: A Quantum Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunability of twisted bilayber graphene (TBG) in particular and the 2D moir\'e materials in general has revealed fascinating quantum many-body states of matter. Unstrained magic-angle TBG at the charge-neutrality point is understood, both experimentally and theoretically, as a correlated insulating state due to the interplay of long-range Coulomb interaction and the quantum metric of the flat bands. However, the fate of the state as one continuously tunes the twist angle is still largely unknown. Theoretically, it was suggested that due to the effective change of interaction strength, angle-tuned TBG might exhibit the first realization of the quantum critical point (QCP) between a correlated insulator and a Dirac semimetal - a condensed matter incarnation of the chiral phase transition of the Gross-Neveu (GN) model studied in the context of quantum chromo dynamics. Here we show that TBG indeed realises an angle-tuned phase transition between a Dirac semimetal and an insulator consistent with a GN quantum criticality in a numerically exact calculation. The transition occurs because the angle effectively tunes the relative weight of kinetic and interaction energy and we map out how this qualitatively changes the single-particle excitation spectrum. Our study is possible due to the recently developed continuous field momentum-space quantum Monte Carlo method, which can fully take into account the long-range Coulomb and quantum metric of flat bands. From the single-particle spectrum, free energy and the analysis of the order parameter of the insulating phase, at system sizes that were not possible before, we find a critical angle of $\Theta_\mathrm{c}$ $\sim$ 1.20(1)$\deg$. This offers the exciting possibility that by tuning away from the magic angle (1.08$\deg$), pristine TBG can mimic a fundamental phase transition of Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>NMR study of the local magnetic order in the kagome Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic Weyl semimetal presents the intriguing possibility of controlling topological properties through magnetic order. The kagome compound \CoSnS~has emerged as one of the most thoroughly characterized magnetic Weyl semimetals, yet the potential coexistence of a ferromagnetic state below $T_c$ = 172~K with a non-collinear antiferromagnetic phase or a glassy state remains unresolved. We employ $^{59}$Co NMR to gain a local perspective on the magnetic order. The magnetic and electric field gradient tensors at room temperature are determined by fitting the NMR spectra using evolutionary algorithms. Zero-field NMR measurements reveal that all Co sites are equivalent in the magnetic phase at low temperatures and up to 90~K. The local magnetic field follows in intensity the macroscopic magnetization as a function of temperature and is tilted from the c-axis by a few degrees toward the nearest triangle center. Above 90~K, a shoulder appears on the low-field side, which we attribute to a preferential tilting of the local field in one direction, breaking the equivalence between the three Co sites of the kagome structure. We rule out any coexistence with an in-plane antiferromagnetic phase and suggest instead that in-plane ferromagnetic-like moments appear above 90~K and play an increasing role in the magnetic order up to the magnetic transition.</description>

      <title>High-field magnetic properties of the alternating ferro-antiferromagnetic spin-chain compound Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive high magnetic field studies of the alternating weakly coupled ferro-antiferromagnetic (FM-AFM) spin-$1/2$ chain compound Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br, with the structure of the natural mineral botallackite. Our measurements reveal a broad magnetization plateau at about half of the saturation value, strongly suggesting that the FM chain sublattice becomes fully polarized, while the AFM chain sublattice remains barely magnetized, in magnetic fields at least up to $50$ T. We confirm a spin-reorientation transition for magnetic fields applied in the $ac^\ast$-plane, whose angular dependence is described in the framework of the mean-field theory. Employing high-field THz spectroscopy, we reveal a complex pattern of high-frequency spinon-magnon bound-state excitations. On the other hand, at lower frequencies we observe two modes of antiferromagnetic resonance, as a consequence of the long-range magnetic ordering. We demonstrate that applied magnetic field tends to suppress the long-range magnetic ordering; the temperature-field phase diagram of the phase transition is obtained for magnetic fields up to $14$ T for three principal directions ($a$, $b$, $c^\ast$).</description>

      <title>d-Wave Magnetism in Cuprates from Oxygen Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic parent phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates has been established as a N\'eel state of copper moments, but early work pointed out the important role of ligand oxygen orbitals. Using the three-orbital Emery model we show how doping-induced antiferromagnetic ordering of weak magnetic moments on the oxygen sites can lead to unconventional d-wave magnetism with spin-split electronic bands. Our mechanism for forming such altermagnetic (AM) states in cuprates does not rely on a lowering of the crystal symmetry but rather on interaction-induced formation of magnetic moments on directional oxygen orbitals within the crystallographic unit cell. Therefore, we obtain two different types of AM, namely a (0,0)-AM and a ($\pi$,$\pi$)-AM, and identify different mechanisms for appearance supported by Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization calculations. We finally suggest a scenario to realize the unconventional spin-split bands in a candidate compound by density functional theory and discuss experimental implications.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Resistant Order in 2+1 Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High temperatures are typically thought to increase disorder. Here we examine this idea in Quantum Field Theory in 2+1 dimensions. For this sake we explore a novel class of tractable models, consisting of nearly-mean-field scalars interacting with critical scalars. We identify UV-complete, local, unitary models in this class and show that symmetry breaking $\mathbb{Z}_2 \to \emptyset$ occurs at any temperature in some regions of the phase diagram. This phenomenon, previously observed in models with fractional dimensions, or in the strict planar limits, or with non-local interactions, is now exhibited in a local, unitary 2+1 dimensional model with a finite number of fields.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</description>

      <title>Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J&lt;0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1&lt;U/|J|&lt;-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J&gt;0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2&lt;U/|J|&lt;0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|&gt;-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J&gt;0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Coherent and Incoherent Effects in Superconductor Photoemission Spectra via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangling coherent and incoherent effects in the photoemission spectra of strongly correlated materials is generally a challenging problem due to the involvement of numerous parameters. In this study, we employ machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to address the long-standing issue of the bilayer splitting in superconducting cuprates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN training on modeled spectra and confirm earlier findings that establish the presence of bilayer splitting across the entire doping range. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of the splitting does not decrease with underdoping, contrary to expectations. This approach not only highlights the potential of machine learning in tackling complex physical problems but also provides a robust framework for advancing the analysis of electronic properties in correlated superconductors.</description>

      <title>Giant Nernst Angle in Self-Intercalated van der Waals Magnet Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials has propelled advancements in technological devices. The Nernst effect, which generates a transverse electric voltage in the presence of a longitudinal thermal gradient, shows great promise for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we report the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$, a layered self-intercalated vdW material which exhibits an antiferromagnetic ordering at TN ~ 191 K followed by a ferromagnetic-like phase transition at TC ~171 K. We observe a prominent topological Hall effect and topological Nernst effect between TC and TN, which is ascribable to non-coplanar spin textures inducing a real-space Berry phase due to competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we show that Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ exhibits a substantial anomalous Nernst effect, featuring a giant Nernst angle of ~37% near TC and a maximum Nernst thermoelectric coefficient of 0.52 uV/K. These results surpass those of conventional ferromagnets and other two-dimensional vdW materials, highlighting Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ as a promising candidate for advanced thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study sets forth a carbon based two-dimensional (2D) kagome topological insulator without containing any metal atoms, that aligns the Fermi level with the Dirac point without the need for doping, overcoming a significant bottleneck issue observed in 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based kagome structures. Our 2D kagome structure formed by creating patterned nano pores in the graphene sheet, nomenclatured as porous graphene-based kagome lattice (PGKL), is inspired by the recent bottom-up synthesis of similar structures. Because of absence of mirror symmetry in our porous graphene, by considering only first nearest neighbour intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) within the tight-binding model unlike mostly used next nearest neighbour ISOC in the Kane-Mele model for graphene, PGKL exhibits distinctive band structures with Dirac bands amidst flat bands, allowing for the realization of topological states near the Fermi level. Delving into Berry curvature and Chern numbers provides a comprehensive understanding of the topological insulating properties of PGKL, offering valuable insights into 2D topological insulators. Analysis of the 1-D ribbon structure underscores the emergence of topological edge states.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group Study of Domain Wall Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale topological spin textures in magnetic systems are emerging as promising candidates for scalable quantum architectures. Despite their potential as qubits, previous studies have been limited to semiclassical approaches, leaving a critical gap: the lack of a fully quantum demonstration. Here, we address this challenge by employing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to establish domain wall (DW) qubits in coupled quantum spin-1/2 chains. We calculate the ground-state energies and excitation gaps of the system and find that DWs with opposite chiralities form a well-defined low-energy sector, distinctly isolated from higher excited states in the presence of anisotropies. This renders the chirality states suitable for encoding quantum information, serving as robust qubits. Interestingly, when a magnetic field is applied, we observe tunneling between quantum DW states with opposite chiralities. Through quantum simulations, we construct an effective qubit Hamiltonian that exhibits strongly anisotropic $g$-factors, offering a way to implement single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we obtain an effective interacting Hamiltonian for two mobile DWs in coupled quantum spin chains from DMRG simulations, enabling the implementation of two-qubit gates. Our work represents a critical step from semiclassical constructions to a fully quantum demonstration of the potential of DW textures for scalable quantum computing, establishing a solid foundation for future quantum architectures based on topological magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Many-body dynamics with explicitly time-dependent neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of many-body quantum systems is a significant challenge, especially in higher dimensions where entanglement grows rapidly. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer a promising tool for representing quantum wavefunctions, but their application to time evolution faces scaling challenges. We introduce the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS), a novel approach incorporating explicit time dependence into the neural network ansatz. This framework optimizes a single, time-independent set of parameters to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation across an entire time interval. We detail an autoregressive, attention-based transformer architecture and techniques for extending the model's applicability. To benchmark and demonstrate our method, we simulate quench dynamics in the 2D transverse field Ising model and the time-dependent preparation of the 2D antiferromagnetic state in a Heisenberg model, demonstrating state of the art performance, scalability, and extrapolation to unseen intervals. These results establish t-NQS as a powerful framework for exploring quantum dynamics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions impose fundamental limits on the brightness of continuous and pulsed electron beams. When multiple electrons leave a field emitter within a space-time volume of femtoseconds and nanometers, their mutual repulsion creates well-defined correlations in energy and time. Such correlations remain undetected in ensemble measurements that average over the statistics of the emission process. Here, we employ event-based and femtosecond-gated detection of photoelectron states to map Coulomb-correlated few-particle phase-space distributions. Inelastic electron-light scattering experiments performed on two-electron states reveal a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space. Reconstructing the phase-space density, we find an overall energy-time dispersion that is distinct from that of the two separated sub-ensembles forming the bimodal distribution. Our findings disentangle correlation-induced and dispersive contributions to the energy-time structure of few-electron pulses and promote future electron microscopy schemes enhanced by multi-electron states.</description>

      <title>Echo State network for coarsening dynamics of charge density waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An echo state network (ESN) is a type of reservoir computer that uses a recurrent neural network with a sparsely connected hidden layer. Compared with other recurrent neural networks, one great advantage of ESN is the simplicity of its training process. Yet, despite the seemingly restricted learnable parameters, ESN has been shown to successfully capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of complex patterns. Here we build an ESN to model the coarsening dynamics of charge-density waves (CDW) in a semi-classical Holstein model, which exhibits a checkerboard electron density modulation at half-filling stabilized by a commensurate lattice distortion. The inputs to the ESN are local CDW order-parameters in a finite neighborhood centered around a given site, while the output is the predicted CDW order of the center site at the next time step. Special care is taken in the design of couplings between hidden layer and input nodes to ensure lattice symmetries are properly incorporated into the ESN model. Since the model predictions depend only on CDW configurations of a finite domain, the ESN is scalable and transferrable in the sense that a model trained on dataset from a small system can be directly applied to dynamical simulations on larger lattices. Our work opens a new avenue for efficient dynamical modeling of pattern formations in functional electron materials.</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$, which manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

Abstract: We systematically construct two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) three-state Potts paramagnets with gapless edge modes on a triangular lattice. First, we study microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding symmetry distinguishing between two SPT phases. As a result, the two topologically nontrivial and the trivial phases define a general one-dimensional chain supporting a tricriticality, which we argue supports a gapless SPT order in one dimension.</description>

      <title>The nature of low-temperature spin-freezing in frustrated Kitaev magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and spin correlations in frustrated Kitaev quantum materials offers an ideal platform to host non-trivial quantum states with exotic fractional excitations. The signature of spin-freezing behavior of these spin-orbit-driven frustrated magnets is characterized by a bifurcation of zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures much below the characteristic interaction energy scale of spins. The temperature dependence of magnetic specific heat exhibits Cm~ T^2 dependence near the freezing temperature. The field-independent behavior of Cm below the freezing temperature implies the presence of exotic low-energy excitations. The aging and memory effect experiments in the Kitaev magnets suggest a non-hierarchical free energy distribution, which differs from the hierarchical organization of conventional spin-freezing. Furthermore, the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follows a power law behavior below the spin-freezing temperature, suggesting the persistence of unconventional spin excitation spectra. Herein, we demonstrate that the observed low-temperature spin-freezing phenomena in a few representative Kitaev quantum materials can be effectively explained by the Halperin and Saslow (HS) hydrodynamic modes relevant for non-trivial spin glass materials. The linearly dispersive HS modes are hypothesized to account for instigating non-abelian defect propagation, thereby inducing a spin jam state in the low-temperature regime in frustrated Kitaev magnets. Our investigation reveals that HS modes capture the essence of unconventional spin-freezing ascribed to topological origin in two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev magnets decorated on a honeycomb lattice and its 3D analog hyperhoneycomb that offers a viable ground to extend this framework to a large class of frustrated quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Isolated quantum many-body systems which thermalize under their own dynamics are expected to act as their own thermal baths, thereby bringing their local subsystems to thermal equilibrium. Here we show that the infinite-dimensional limit of a quantum lattice model, as described by Dynamical Mean-Field theory (DMFT), provides a natural framework to understand this self-consistent thermalization process. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model as working example, we demonstrate that the emergence of a self-consistent bath thermalising the system is characterized by a sharp thermalization front, moving balistically and separating the initial condition from the long-time thermal fixed point. We characterize the full DMFT dynamics through an effective temperature for which we derive a travelling-wave equation of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) type. This equation allows to predict the asymptotic shape of the front and its velocity, which match perfectly the full DMFT numerics. Our results provide a new angle to understand the onset of quantum thermalisation in closed isolated systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a framework to design concurrently a frustration-free quantum many-body Hamiltonian and its numerically exact ground states on a sufficiently large finite-size cluster in one and two dimensions using an elementary matrix product state (MPS) representation. Our approach strategically chooses a local cluster Hamiltonian, which is arranged to overlap with neighboring clusters on a designed lattice. The frustration-free Hamiltonian is given as the sum of the cluster Hamiltonians by ensuring that there exists a state that has its local submanifolds as the lowest-energy eigenstate of every cluster. The key to find such a solution is a systematic protocol, which projects out excited states on every cluster using MPS and effectively entangles the cluster states. The protocol offers several advantages, including the ability to achieve exact many-body ground-state solutions at nearly equal cost in one and two dimensions, those belonging to gapless or long-range entangled classes of ground states, flexibility in designing Hamiltonians unbiasedly across various forms of models, and numerically feasible validation through energy calculations. Our protocol offers the exact ground state for general frustration-free Hamiltonian, and enables the exploration of exact phase boundaries and the analysis of even a spatially nonuniform random system, providing platforms for quantum simulations and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity beyond pairing in Fermi-liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions for flat dispersion $\varepsilon \sim k^4$, without using pairing instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. These topological chiral superconductors can be fully or partially spin-valley polarized. For partial spin-valley polarization, the ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation, neutral quasiparticles with fractional statistics, and/or gapless chiral edge states. Two of the topological chiral superconductors are in the same phases as the ``spin''-triplet or spinless $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the optical band gap through an effective Thirring interaction for massive Dirac-like electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze mass renormalization in massive Dirac-like systems in (2+1) dimensions arising from electron-phonon interactions at finite temperatures, employing the large-$N$ expansion. Our model combines the low-energy description of charge carriers in a buckled honeycomb lattice with the low-energy approximation for phonons and electron-phonon interactions in two-dimensional materials. Consequently, the system is modeled as a massive Dirac-like field coupled to a two-component vector field $\mathcal{A}_i$, representing the phonon modes. This framework allows us to compute the one-loop electron self-energy at finite temperature, from which we derive the renormalized band gap, $m^R$. The effective model is subsequently applied to describe the renormalized optical band gap in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$. A good agreement is observed with experimental data for reasonable values of the ultraviolet cutoff, $\Lambda \approx 1$ eV. Our main findings indicate that $m^R$ remains nearly constant at low temperatures, whereas at higher temperatures it decreases linearly with the temperature $T$. Specifically, we find that $m^R$ reduces by approximately $\approx [0.1,0.2]$ eV as the temperature increases from $\approx 4$ K to $500$ K, consistent with recent experimental observations. Furthermore, we estimate the temperature range at which the transition to the linear regime occurs, obtaining typical values within $\approx [110,150]$ K for the four materials under consideration.</description>

      <title>Aspects of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T }$ deformed Schwarzian: From gravity partition function to late-time spectral form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16658v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate different thermodynamic properties of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T}$ deformed Schwarzian theory and its different gravitational perspectives. First, we compute the partition function of $U(1)$ coupled 2D-gravity with fixed chemical potential, obtained from the dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. Then, we compute the partition function of the gravity theory which is the dual to the deformed Schwarzian living on its boundary and study the genus expansion of the one and two-point correlation function of the partition function of the theory. Subsequently, we use the one-point function to compute the "Annealed" and "Quenched" free energy in low-temperature limits and make a qualitative comparison with the undeformed theory. Then, using the two-point function, we compute the Spectral Form Factor of the deformed theory in early and late time. We find a dip and ramp structure in early and late time, respectively. We also get a plateau structure in the $\tau$-scaling limit. Last but not least, we comment on the late-time topology change to give a physical interpretation of the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor for our theory.</description>

      <title>Ruddlesden-Popper and perovskite phases as a material platform for altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subclass of collinear antiferromagnets where spin Kramers degeneracy is broken -- resulting in ferromagnetic-like properties -- offers exciting new opportunities in magnetism and hence motivates the reasoned expansion of the material base for these so-called altermagnets. Here, we show that Ruddlesden-Popper and perovskite phases are generic hosts for altermagnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate altermagnetism in prototypical nickel-based systems such as La$_2$NiO$_4$ and identify additional candidates, including the superconducting La$_3$Ni$_3$O$_7$ and the multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. These materials span insulating, semiconducting, and metallic conduction types, with computed nonrelativistic spin splittings reaching up to 250~meV. Our analysis also reveals the presence of accidental nodes and distinct topologies in the spin-momentum texture at the Brillouin-zone boundary, suggesting a refined classification for altermagnetic materials beyond the $d$-wave or higher even-parity wave classes. In addition, we address formal inconsistencies in the traditional classification of magnetically ordered systems, proposing resolutions grounded in the altermagnetic framework, and point out the potential for altermagnetic behavior in systems beyond collinear antiferromagnets with perfectly compensated magnetization, broadening the scope for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Computations That Capture Strict Variationality, Volume Law Behavior, and the Efficient Representation of Neural Network States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions from Heating to non-heating in SU(1, 1) quantum dynamics: applications to Bose-Einstein condensates and periodically driven coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism and Topology of the Higher Flat Band in a Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e fractional Chern insulators provides an opportunity to investigate zero magnetic field anyons. To potentially realize non-Abelian anyons, one approach is to engineer higher flat Chern bands that mimic higher Landau levels. Here, we investigate the interaction, topology, and ferromagnetism of the second moir\'e miniband in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. At half filling of the second miniband, we observe spontaneous ferromagnetism and an incipient Chern insulator state. The Chern numbers of the top two moir\'e flat bands exhibit opposite signs for twist angles above 3.1{\deg}, but share the same sign near 2.6{\deg}, consistent with theoretical predictions. In the 2.6{\deg} device, increasing magnetic field induces a topological phase transition via band crossing between opposite valleys, resulting in an emergent state with Chern number C = -2. Additionally, an insulating state at half filling of the second valley-polarized band suggests a charge-ordered state is favored over the fractional Chern insulator state. These findings lay a foundation for understanding the higher flat Chern bands, crucial for the discovery of non-Abelian fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into L parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. We show that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a fractal multipartite decomposition: it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction. Building upon this result, we then build exact, analytical tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of generalized Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. It is an example of a correlated hopping model in which chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter in the anyon-Hubbard model and we find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard pattern in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.</description>
