      <title>Probing the interference between non-linear, axionic and space-time-anisotropy effects in the QED vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pursue the investigation of a generic non-linear extension of axionic electrodynamics in a Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) scenario that implements Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV). The model we inspect consists of an arbitrary non-linear electrodynamic action coupled to the axion field in presence of an anisotropy four-vector that realizes the breaking of Lorentz symmetry under the particle point of view. The non-linear electromagnetic field is expanded around a constant and uniform magnetic background up to second order in the propagating photon field. The focus of our attention is the study of the material properties of the vacuum in the particular case of a space-like CFJ $4$-vector. The dispersion relations associated to the plane wave solutions are explicitly worked out in two situations: the magnetic background perpendicular and parallel to the wave direction. We extend these results to consider the analysis of the birefringence phenomenon in presence of non-linearity, the axion and the LSV manifested through the spatial anisotropy. Three specific proposals of non-linear electrodynamics are contemplated: Euler-Heisenberg, Born-Infeld and the Modified Maxwell electrodynamics. Throughout the paper, we shall justify why we follow the unusual path of connecting, in a single Lagrangian density, three pieces of physics beyond the Standard Model, namely, non-linearity, axions and LSV. Our true goal is to actually inspect and describe how axionic, non-linear and LSV effects interfere with one another whenever physical entities like group velocity, refraction indices, birefringence and effective masses of physical excitations are computed in presence of an external constant and homogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The ALPHA-g experiment, the hunt for gravitational dipoles and the quantum vacuum as the source of gravity in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More recently, the ALPHA-g experiment has shown that antiatoms fall in the Earth's gravitational field like ordinary atoms, with the non-negligible possibility that antiatoms fall with a slightly lower acceleration. A possible lower acceleration of antiatoms (which could be revealed with two orders of magnitude higher precision measurements) would be an epoch-making discovery and a window to a new physics, suggesting among other things that quarks and antiquarks have gravitational charges of opposite sign. If gravitational charges of opposite sign exist, it implies the existence of virtual gravitational dipoles in the quantum vacuum, and opens up the possibility of including the quantum vacuum as an important source of gravity in the Universe.</description>

      <title>On possible embeddings of the standard model of particle physics and gravity in $E_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigate the structure of $E_8$ under the action of the subalgebra/subgroup $A_1+G_2+C_3$, as a potential route to unification of the fundamental forces of nature into a single algebraic structure. The particular real form $E_{8(-24)}$ supports a decomposition into compact $G_2$ plus split $A_1+C_3$, which allows a restriction from $G_2$ to $SU(3)$ for the strong force, together with split $SL_2(\mathbb R)$ to break the symmetry of the weak interaction and give mass to the intermediate vector bosons. The factor $C_3$ contains various copies of the Lorentz group $SL_2(\mathbb C)$ and extends the `spacetime' symmetries to the full group of symplectic symmetries of real $3+3$-dimensional phase space.
  Restricting $G_2$ to the Standard Model $SU(3)$ extends $C_3$ to $A_5$, in the real form $SU(3,3)$, acting on a complex phase space that includes both momentum and current. There is then a natural restriction from $SU(3,3)$ to $SO(3,3)$, describing the action of $SL_4(\mathbb R)$ on phase space. The resulting action of $SL_4(\mathbb R)$ on $E_8$ includes tensors that are equivalent to the stress-energy tensor, the Ricci tensor and the Riemann tensor, and therefore permits the formalism of general relativity to be developed inside $E_{8(-24)}$. The model then suggests unexpected and perhaps subtle ways in which general relativity and particle physics may be forced to modify each other, in order to produce a unified theory.</description>
