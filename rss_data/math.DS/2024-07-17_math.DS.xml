      <title>Critical Points, Stability, and Basins of Attraction of Three Kuramoto Oscillators with Isosceles Triangle Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the Kuramoto model with three oscillators that are interconnected by an isosceles triangle network. The characteristic of this model is that the coupling connections between the oscillators can be either attractive or repulsive. We list all critical points and investigate their stability. We furthermore present a framework studying convergence towards stable critical points under special coupled strengths. The main tool is the linearization and the monotonicity arguments of oscillator diameter.</description>

      <title>Efficient prediction of static and dynamical responses of functional graded beams using sparse multiscale patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multiscale patch scheme for studying the system level characteristics of heterogeneous functional graded beams. The algorithm computes the detailed beam dynamics on the microscale, but only in small patches of the beam domain, and then applies symmetry-preserving interpolation to these patches to accurately predict the macroscale behaviour. To validate the algorithm, two examples of functionally graded beams are investigated, namely cross-sectionally graded and axially graded. Gradient patterns are defined via volume fractions of aluminium and silicon carbine either over the beam's cross section or along its axial direction. In these examples the multiscale patch scheme only computes over a fraction of the beam's full-domain. Beam deflection and natural frequencies from the patch computations agree very well with existing experimental data and the full-domain computations. The algorithm is stable and robust, with errors consistently small and reliably reducible by increasing the number of patches. The reduction in the spatial domain of computation substantially improves the computational efficiency, with the computational time reducing by a factor of up to 17 when the patches cover 27% of the beam.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of the Approximate Analytical Solution of the Surf-Riding Threshold in the IMO Second Generation Intact Stability Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Maritime Organization developed the Second Generation Intact Stability Criteria (SGISC) with the objective of mitigating maritime incidents attributable to roll motion. Given that surf-riding precedes broaching, the SGISC uses vulnerability criteria for broaching based on surf-riding dynamics. The surf-riding threshold is derived by Melnikov's method in the level-2 vulnerability criterion. In this paper, the authors discuss the uniqueness of the approximate analytical solutions to be used as the surf-riding threshold in the SGISC and based on the relationship between Melnikov's analysis and its physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-SGHN: A Robust Model for Learning Particle Interactions in Lattice Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an $\alpha$-separable graph Hamiltonian network ($\alpha$-SGHN) that reveals complex interaction patterns between particles in lattice systems. Utilizing trajectory data, $\alpha$-SGHN infers potential interactions without prior knowledge about particle coupling, overcoming the limitations of traditional graph neural networks that require predefined links. Furthermore, $\alpha$-SGHN preserves all conservation laws during trajectory prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model, incorporating structural information, outperforms baseline models based on conventional neural networks in predicting lattice systems. We anticipate that the results presented will be applicable beyond the specific onsite and inter-site interaction lattices studied, including the Frenkel-Kontorova model, the rotator lattice, and the Toda lattice.</description>

      <title>Spectral gaps and Fourier decay for self-conformal measures in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every self conformal measure with respect to a $C^\omega (\mathbb{C})$ IFS has polynomial Fourier decay under some mild non-linearity and irreducibility conditions. A key step is the proof of a uniform spectral gap for the transfer operator that does not require the cylinder covering of the attractor to be a Markov partition. It is based on a cocycle version of a method of Oh-Winter (2017).</description>

      <title>On regularity of mild solutions for autonomous linear retarded functional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of mild solutions for autonomous linear retarded functional differential equations (RFDEs) has been introduced in [J. Nishiguchi, Electron.\ J. Qual.\ Theory Differ.\ Equ.\ \textbf{2023}, No.~32, 1--77] for the purpose of defining fundamental matrix solutions and obtaining a variation of constants formula for the RFDEs. This notion gives a straightforward definition of solutions to the RFDEs under discontinuous history functions compared with previous studies in the literature. For a given autonomous linear RFDE, it holds that the fundamental matrix solutions are locally Lipschitz continuous on the interval $[0, \infty)$. However, it is not apparent whether a similar property is true for the mild solutions. Here we obtain a result which shows the regularity of mild solutions on $[0, \infty)$ for autonomous linear RFDEs. The result makes clear a connection between the mild solutions and solution concepts in previous studies.</description>

      <title>On Fourier Asymptotics and Effective Equidistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove effective equidistribution of expanding horocycles in $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to various classes of Borel probability measures on $\mathbb{R}$ having certain Fourier asymptotics. Our proof involves new techniques combining tools from automorphic forms and harmonic analysis.
  In particular, we prove effective equidistribution with respect to the Hausdorff measures on certain shifted, possibly irrational, missing digit Cantor sets, whose Hausdorff dimensions can be as small as 0.61. This improves upon the dimension and rationality restrictions of the recent breakthrough of Khalil--Luethi [Invent. Math].
  As an application in Diophantine approximation, a complete Khintchine's theorem follows for a large class of self-similar measures extending a groundbreaking work of Yu [arXiv, 2101.05910].</description>

      <title>Simplifications of Lax pairs for differential-difference equations by gauge transformations and (doubly) modified integrable equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12022v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix differential-difference Lax pairs play an essential role in the theory of integrable nonlinear differential-difference equations. We present sufficient conditions which allow one to simplify such a Lax pair by matrix gauge transformations. Furthermore, we describe a procedure for such a simplification and present applications of it to constructing new integrable equations connected by (non-invertible) discrete substitutions of Miura type to known equations with Lax pairs.
  Suppose that one has three (possibly multicomponent) equations $E$, $E_1$, $E_2$, a (Miura-type) discrete substitution from $E_1$ to $E$, and a discrete substitution from $E_2$ to $E_1$. Then $E_1$ and $E_2$ can be called a modified version of $E$ and a doubly modified version of $E$, respectively. We demonstrate how the above-mentioned procedure helps (in the considered examples) to construct modified and doubly modified versions of a given equation possessing a Lax pair satisfying certain conditions.
  The considered examples include scalar equations of Itoh-Narita-Bogoyavlensky type and $2$-component equations related to the Toda lattice. We present several new integrable equations connected by new discrete substitutions of Miura type to known equations.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal Homeostasis in Mass-Action Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homeostasis occurs in a biological system when a chosen output variable remains approximately constant despite changes in an input variable. In this work we specifically focus on biological systems which may be represented as chemical reaction networks and consider their infinitesimal homeostasis, where the derivative of the input-output function is zero. The specific challenge of chemical reaction networks is that they often obey various conservation laws complicating the standard input-output analysis. We derive several results that allow to verify the existence of infinitesimal homeostasis points both in the absence of conservation and under conservation laws where conserved quantities serve as input parameters. In particular, we introduce the notion of infinitesimal concentration robustness, where the output variable remains nearly constant despite fluctuations in the conserved quantities. We provide several examples of chemical networks which illustrate our results both in deterministic and stochastic settings.</description>

      <title>Competition between group interactions and nonlinearity in voter dynamics on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social dynamics are often driven by both pairwise (i.e., dyadic) relationships and higher-order (i.e., polyadic) group relationships, which one can describe using hypergraphs. To gain insight into the impact of polyadic relationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a polyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), in which we incorporate the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions that are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the competition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves consensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimum minimizing exit time {\tau} . We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on annealed uniform hypergraphs with N nodes, for which {\tau} scales as A ln N, where the prefactor A depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint factors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and nonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such competing effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study frequently recurrent unilateral and bilateral backward shift operators on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. We prove that if a backward shift admits a non-zero frequently recurrent vector, then it supports a dense set of such vectors, so that the operator is frequently recurrent. As a consequence, we provide two different characterizations for frequently recurrent backward shift operators and we show dense lineability of the set of the set of frequently recurrent vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.08264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the probability of shadowing of a random finite pseudotrajectory by an exact trajectory for linear skew products. We describe general conditions under which a random pseudotrajectory can be shadowed with polynomial (with respect to its length) precision with high probability. Examples satisfying that general condition are continuous linear skew products over Bernoulli shift, doubling map on a circle, and any Anosov linear map on a torus. The main tool used in the proof is Cramer's large deviation theorem.</description>

      <title>Stability of Translating States for Self-propelled Swarms with Quadratic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is proving the stability of translating states (flocking states) for the system of $n$-coupled self-propelled agents governed by $\ddot r_k = (1-|\dot r_k|^2)\dot r_k - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n(r_k-r_j)$, $r_k\in \mathbb R^2$. A flocking state is a solution where all agents move with identical velocity, of magnitude one. Numerical explorations have shown that for a large set of initial conditions, after some drift, the particles' velocities align, and the distance between agents tends to zero. We prove that every solution starting near a translating state asymptotically approaches a translating state nearby, an asymptotic behavior exclusive to swarms in the plane. We quantify the rate of convergence for the directional drift, the mean field speed, and the oscillations in the direction normal to the motion. The latter decay at a rate of $1/ \sqrt t$, mimicking the oscillations of some systems with almost periodic coefficients and cubic nonlinearities. We give sufficient conditions for that class of systems to have an asymptotically stable origin.</description>

      <title>Passivity Tools for Hybrid Learning Rules in Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has pioneered the use of system-theoretic passivity to study equilibrium stability for the dynamics of noncooperative strategic interactions in large populations of learning agents. In this and related works, the stability analysis leverages knowledge that certain ``canonical'' classes of learning rules used to model the agents' strategic behaviors satisfy a passivity condition known as $\delta$-passivity. In this paper, we consider that agents exhibit learning behaviors that do not align with a canonical class. Specifically, we focus on characterizing $\delta$-passivity for hybrid learning rules that combine elements from canonical classes. Our analysis also introduces and uses a more general version of $\delta$-passivity, which, for the first time, can handle discontinuous learning rules, including those showing best-response behaviors. We state and prove theorems establishing $\delta$-passivity for two broad convex cones of hybrid learning rules. These cones can merge into a larger one preserving $\delta$-passivity in scenarios limited to two strategies. In our proofs, we establish intermediate facts that are significant on their own and could potentially be used to further generalize our work. We illustrate the applicability of our results through numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Newtonian planar three-body problem, defining a syzygy (velocity syzygy) as a configuration where the positions (velocities) of the three bodies become collinear. We demonstrate that if the total energy is negative, every collision-free solution has an infinite number of velocity syzygies. Specifically, the velocities of the three bodies become parallel within every interval of time containing three consecutive syzygies. Using comparison theory for matrix Riccati equations, we derive new upper and lower bounds on the moments when syzygies occur.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Processes: entropy, Gibbs states and the continuous time Ruelle operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Riemmaniann compact manifold $M$, the associated Laplacian $\Delta$ and the corresponding Brownian motion $X_t$, $t\geq 0.$ Given a Lipschitz function $V:M\to\mathbb R$ we consider the operator $\frac{1}{2}\Delta+V$, which acts on differentiable functions $f: M\to\mathbb R$ via the operator
  $$\frac{1}{2} \Delta f(x)+\,V(x)f(x) ,$$ for all $x\in M$.
  Denote by $P_t^V$, $t \geq 0,$ the semigroup acting on functions $f: M\to\mathbb R$ given by $$P_{t}^V (f)(x)\,:=\, \mathbb E_{x} \big[e^{\int_0^{t} V(X_r)\,dr} f(X_t)\big].\,$$
  We will show that this semigroup is a continuous-time version of the discrete-time Ruelle operator.
  Consider the positive differentiable eigenfunction $F: M \to \mathbb{R}$ associated to the main eigenvalue $\lambda$ for the semigroup $P_t^V$, $t \geq 0$. From the function $F$, in a procedure similar to the one used in the case of discrete-time Thermodynamic Formalism, we can associate via a coboundary procedure a certain stationary Markov semigroup. The probability on the Skhorohod space obtained from this new stationary Markov semigroup can be seen as a stationary Gibbs state associated with the potential $V$. We define entropy, pressure, the continuous-time Ruelle operator and we present a variational principle of pressure for such a setting.</description>
