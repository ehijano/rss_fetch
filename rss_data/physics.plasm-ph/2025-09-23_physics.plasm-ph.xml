      <title>Exponential Spectral Scaling: Robust and Efficient Stellarator Boundary Optimization via Mode-Dependent Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellarator boundary optimization faces a fundamental numerical challenge: the extreme disparity between low- and high-mode amplitudes creates an optimization landscape in which direct full-spectrum approaches typically converge to poor local minima. Traditionally, this challenge has been addressed through a computationally expensive, multi-step Fourier continuation, in which low Fourier modes are optimized first, followed by the gradual incorporation of higher modes. We present Exponential Spectral Scaling (ESS), a technique that applies a mode-dependent exponential scaling factor to each Fourier mode. Our primary implementation uses the $L_{\infty}$ norm to determine the scaling pattern, creating a square spectral decay profile that effectively reduces the dynamic range of optimization variables from $10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ to $10^{2}$--$10^{3}$. This scaling aligns with the natural spectral decay of physically meaningful configurations and enables direct single-step optimization using the full spectrum of boundary Fourier modes. ESS eliminates arbitrary staging decisions and reduces computation time by a factor of $2$ to $5$ in benchmark cases. In addition to accelerating optimization, ESS improves robustness, reducing sensitivity to initial conditions and increasing confidence in avoiding local optima. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESS across both quasi-axisymmetric (QA) and quasi-helically symmetric (QH) configurations, using two distinct optimization toolkits: SIMSOPT and DESC.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling of Phase Mixing Dynamics from Particle Kinetic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase mixing is a fundamental kinetic process that governs dissipation and stability in collisionless plasmas, but its inherent filamentation in velocity space creates major challenges for both high-fidelity simulations and reduced-order modeling. This work presents the first exploratory evaluation of a joint Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (POD-SINDy) framework applied to particle-in-cell simulations of phase mixing. Simulation datasets were generated under progressively complex conditions, starting from a passive kinetic case without self-consistent electric fields, extending to self-consistent simulations with nonlinear electric field feedback, and finally to a noisy dataset with reduced particle resolution. In the passive kinetic regime, POD-SINDy achieved near-optimal reconstructions with only five modes, reproducing filamentation with errors below four percent. In self-consistent electrostatic cases, variance spread across more modes due to nonlinear interactions and noise, slowing singular value decay and making strict low-rank embeddings more demanding. Nevertheless, retaining ten modes was sufficient to recover the dominant structures, yielding reconstruction errors of about seven percent for the low-noise case and thirteen percent for the noisy dataset. Across all scenarios, SINDy provided sparse and interpretable equations for modal amplitudes that remained predominantly linear despite the underlying nonlinear data, while POD truncation effectively filtered particle noise and preserved coherent dynamics. These findings demonstrate that POD-SINDy constitutes a compact and interpretable approach to reduced-order modeling of phase mixing, capable of retaining essential physics across regimes of increasing complexity while achieving data compression from three to five orders of magnitude depending on dataset complexity.</description>

      <title>Measuring the locations and properties of VHF sources emitted from an aircraft flying through high clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to locate the few places on the body of an airplane, while it is flying through high clouds, from which broad-band, pulsed, radiation is emitted at Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequencies. This serendipitous discovery was made whilst imaging a lightning flash using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). This observation provides insights into the way the airplane sheds the electrical charge it acquires when flying through clouds. Furthermore, this observation allowed us to test and improve the precision and accuracy for our lightning observation techniques.
  Our new results indicate that with the improved procedure the location precision for strong pulses is better than 50~cm, with the orientation of linear polarization being accurate to within 25$^\circ$. For the present case of a Boeing 777-300ER, VHF emissions were observed exclusively associated with the two engines, as well as a specific spot on the tail. Despite the aircraft flying through clouds at an altitude of 8~km, we did not detect any emissions from electrostatic wicks.</description>

      <title>Galilean Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Galilean electromagnetic particle-in-cell (GEM-PIC) algorithm, which transforms the full set of Maxwell equations and the Vlasov equation into the boosted coordinates. This approach preserves the electromagnetic structure of the interaction while exploiting scale separation for computational effi ciency. Unlike quasistatic methods, GEM-PIC does not have to distinguish between beam and streaming particles, allowing a self-consistent treatment of particle trapping. The EM-PIC algorithm allows for highly effi cient and accurate simulations of plasma-based wakefield acceleration.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear anisotropic equilibrium reconstruction in axisymmetric magnetic mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction is a crucial simulation capability for interpreting diagnostic measurements of experimental plasmas. Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $\beta = 2\mu_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$\beta$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $\beta$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>Negative charge acquisition by isolated single microdroplets from plasma exposure at atmospheric pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged liquid microdroplets have generated significant interest recently due to the observation of chemical reaction rate enhancement by orders of magnitude. Droplet charging by plasma irradiation has been observed along with significantly enhanced reactions in liquid. In this paper we measure the charge on fixed size (47 $\mu$m) individual droplets, exposed for approximately 4 ms to a low temperature RF-driven plasma operated at atmospheric pressure. The measured charge values (0.8--2.0 $\times 10^{7}$ electrons) approached the Rayleigh limit for the given droplet diameter. Results were compared with finite element simulations of plasma charging which provided estimates of surface electric fields and charge fluxes to the droplet surface and helps advance the development of a theoretical framework for plasma-charged microreactors.</description>

      <title>Modeling stopping power of ions in plasmas using parametric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the ion stopping power due to free and bound electrons in a warm dense plasma. Our main goal is to propose a method of stopping-power calculation expected to be valid for any ionization degree. The free-electron contribution is described by the Maynard-Deutsch-Zimmerman formula and the bound-electron one relies on the Bethe formula with corrections, in particular taking into account density and shell effects. The impact of the bound-state computation by three different parametric potentials is investigated within the Garbet formalism for the mean excitation energy. The first parametric potential is due to Green, Sellin and Zachor, the second one was proposed by Yunta, and the third one was introduced by Klapisch in the framework of atomic-structure computations. The results are compared to the ones of self-consistent average-atom calculations. This approach correctly bridges the limits of neutral and fully-ionized matter.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Ground Testing for the Intake Device of an Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) is a promising technology for long-term orbit maintenance in very-low-Earth orbit. The intake device plays a crucial role in capturing and supplying propellant, and its capture efficiency is a key indicator of drag-compensation feasibility. For experimental evaluation, an electric-propulsion (EP) plasma plume can be used as a particle-flow generator to simulate the VLEO atmosphere in ground facilities. This study numerically investigates the interaction of an EP plasma plume with an intake device to establish guidelines for measuring capture efficiency in conventional vacuum facilities. A hybrid PIC-DSMC method with ion-surface interaction models is employed to simulate the plasma plume incident on the intake. The composition of the captured flow is governed by beam-ion energy and species mass: lowering the energy and using lighter atmospheric constituents increase plume divergence and promote neutralization, yielding a neutral-dominated outlet flow. Sputtering of the intake surface becomes non-negligible at high energies but can be mitigated by operating at appropriately low beam energies. The results show that simultaneous ion and neutral diagnostics are required for reliable capture-efficiency evaluation when using EP plasma plumes in ground facilities.</description>

      <title>Validation of the Following Streamer mechanism for SF6 breakdown induced by floating linear metal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed Following Streamer mechanism (Feng et al. 2025 Phys. Rev. Applied 23 064039) seeks to explain how floating metal particles induce SF6 streamer breakdown in the combined gap. This mechanism is derived from a 2D axisymmetric fluid model, which has limitations in describing multiple streamer events in real-world 3D scenarios. To validate the Following Streamer mechanism, we experimentally investigate the discharge morphology of SF6 streamers induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative pulsed voltage. The results are then compared with those from 2D axisymmetric fluid simulations. The comparison reveals both consistencies and discrepancies. Regarding consistencies, experimentally observed features-such as streamer inception at both ends of the metal particle and the formation of subsequent following streamers-support the general idea of the Following Streamer mechanism. Regarding discrepancies, the experiments show a larger number of following streamers and off-axis propagation paths, which cannot be described in the 2D simulation. For scientific rigor, an extended physical model was proposed to improve the description of the Following Streamer mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located &gt;=90 degrees from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux ropes within reconnection exhausts close to the centers of heliospheric current sheets near the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between magnetic flux ropes and magnetic reconnection is fundamental to both space and astrophysical plasma studies. In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by ~10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of ~12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are &lt;20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by &lt;10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Turbulence at Sub-Electron Scales in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\rho_e$ scales.</description>

      <title>Relativistically-strong electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a two-fluid approach, we consider the properties of relativistically nonlinear (arbitrary $a_0$), circularly polarized electromagnetic waves propagating along magnetic field in electron-ion and pair plasmas. Dispersion relations depend on how wave intensity scales with frequency, $a_0 (\omega)$. For superluminal branches, the nonlinear effects reduce the cut-off frequency, while the general form of the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ remains similar to the linear case. For subluminal waves, whistlers and Alfven, a new effect appears: dispersion curves effectively terminate at finite $\omega^\ast - k^\ast$ due to current starvation. Qualitatively, subluminal modes with fluctuating electric field larger than the guide field, $E_w (\omega) \geq B_0$, cannot propagate.</description>

      <title>Delta-Doped Diamond via in-situ Plasma-Distance Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach for the CVD growth of diamond, where the sample is placed in a defined distance from the reactor baseplate, to which the plasma couples. We observe two previously unknown growth regimes. In the first case, the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma, leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for diamond-based electronics.</description>

Abstract: Plasma turbulence cascading from MHD to kinetic scales in the heliospheric plasma is believed to play a key role in coronal heating and fast solar wind acceleration, but the properties of the turbulence remain poorly constrained by observations. Here we compare the ion-scale density fluctuation levels inferred from the properties of solar radio bursts with the magnetic field fluctuation levels obtained through in-situ measurements in the inner heliosphere. We find that the observed magnetic and density fluctuation amplitudes are consistent with excitation by kinetic Alfv\'en waves and/or KAW structures over broad range of distances from the Sun. We then use the radio diagnostics and the KAW scenario to deduce the radial variation of magnetic fluctuation amplitudes in regions close to the Sun where in-situ measurements cannot be obtained. Further, we calculate the energy cascade rate (plasma heating rate) profile over a region that extends from the low corona ($\sim 0.1$~R$_\odot$) into the heliosphere (out to $\sim 1$~au), and compare it to the energy deposition rate required to drive the solar wind. The cascade rate agrees with the available in-situ measurements and also provides predictions closer than $\sim 10$~R$_\odot$ where in-situ approaches are not available. The results provide unique diagnostics of the ion-scale plasma turbulence amplitude and energy cascade rate spanning over three orders of magnitude in solar distance.</description>

      <title>Impact of nonthermal electron distributions on the triggering of the ion-ion acoustic instability near the Sun: Kinetic simulations</title>

Abstract: Context. In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.</description>

      <title>Vibrational-Electron Heating in Plasma Flows: A Thermodynamically Consistent Model</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) in non-equilibrium {plasma} flows is critical, yet hampered by inadequate models for electron heating from vibrationally excited states. Prior models often relied on ad-hoc scaling or flawed applications of detailed balance that failed to ensure the convergence of electron temperature and species-specific vibrational temperature ($T_{\rm v}$) at thermal equilibrium. This paper introduces a novel, thermodynamically consistent electron heating model derived rigorously from the principle of detailed balance. By assuming a Boltzmann vibrational distribution and employing an effective activation energy, our approach yields a simple heating-to-cooling ratio of $\exp(\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm e}-\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$, where $\theta_{\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature of the species under consideration. This formulation guarantees that $T_{\rm e}$ correctly converges to $T_{\rm v}$ at equilibrium. A key advantage is that our model can utilize total cooling rates determined from swarm experiments, leading to higher accuracy at low electron temperatures. For re-entry flows, the proposed approach predicts an electron temperature several times lower than previous models which results in improved agreement with some flight test data. These more reliable predictions can significantly enhance the modeling fidelity of plasma-assisted combustion, laser-induced plasmas, and various hypersonic plasma technologies such as electron transpiration cooling or magnetohydrodynamic force generators.</description>

      <title>Enhanced beam transport via space charge mitigation in a multistage accelerator for fusion plasma diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient transport of high-current negative ion beams is critical for accurate plasma potential diagnostics using heavy-ion beam probe (HIBP) systems in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. However, strong space-charge effects often degrade transport efficiency, particularly for heavy ions such as Au-. In this study, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in beam transport by introducing an electrostatic lens effect through optimized voltage allocation in a multistage acceleration system. Numerical simulations using IGUN, supported by experiments with the LHD-HIBP system, show that this approach effectively suppresses space-charge-induced beam divergence and loss. Without requiring mechanical modifications to the beamline, the optimized configuration enables a 2-3 fold increase in Au-beam current injected into the tandem accelerator. Consequently, plasma potential measurements were extended to higher-density plasmas, reaching line-averaged electron densities up to $1.75\times 10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$ with improved signal-to-noise ratio. This technique offers a compact, practical, and highly effective solution for transporting high-current heavy-ion beams under space-charge-dominated conditions. Beyond its impact on plasma diagnostics, the method is broadly applicable to a wide range of accelerator systems, including those used in scientific and industrial applications where high-intensity beam transport is required.</description>

      <title>Free electron charging of microdroplets in a plasma at atmospheric pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gas-phase microdroplets have recently demonstrated exceptional chemical properties via suspected mechanisms such as contact electrification and surface charge pinning, producing high surface electric fields. Here, microdroplets are injected into a low-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasma and exposed to an excess free-electron flux. We report the first measurements of droplet charge in a fully collisional plasma, with averages up to 2.5 $\times 10^{5}$ electrons for 15 $\mu$m droplets, dependent on absorbed power. Simulations indicate solid particles under similar conditions acquire $\sim$40\% less charge, likely due to low-mobility water cluster ion formation around evaporating droplets, and predict surface electric fields up to $10^{7}$ V m$^{-1}$ for the smallest droplets (3 $\mu$m). Plasma exposure also produces H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ in the liquid, with concentrations up to 33 mM, corresponding to remarkable generation rates exceeding 275 M s$^{-1}$. The system involves complex, not yet fully elucidated mechanisms. A controlled plasma environment enables defined charge levels and exposure times, allowing systematic study and enhancing droplet properties.</description>

      <title>Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>
