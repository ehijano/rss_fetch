      <title>A Sampling Strategy Benchmark for Machine-Learning-Based Seismic Liquefaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling strategy including sampling methods and training set configurations (training set sample size, train-test split ratio, and class distribution) significantly affects machine-learning (ML) model performance in seismic liquefaction prediction. However, existing ML applications in seismic liquefaction prediction remain fragmented: sampling strategies vary widely across studies without a unified benchmark. Moreover, these studies generally optimize the sample set configuration independently, ignoring the interaction among training set configurations. To address these limitations, this study establishes a benchmark that systematically evaluates sampling methods, training set sample sizes, train-test split ratios, class distributions, and training set configurations coupling on seven mainstream ML models performance, and further improves the predictive accuracy of seismic liquefaction-using a database of 250 historical liquefaction events, evaluated by Acc and F1. The results show that ordered systematic sampling yields the best performance across all models. The optimal model can be trained when the training set sample size is 200, the train-test split ratio is 80:20, and the class distribution range is 1-1.5. Among them, the train-test split ratio most significantly influenced performance, followed by the class distribution, with the training set sample size having the least effect. Furthermore, the Random Forest model achieves the highest performance, while the K-Nearest Neighbor model performs the weakest. Importantly, this study systematically identifies and verifies for the first time that there will be an interaction effect among training set configurations, rather than a simple additive effect. This study provides a benchmark for scholars to select the optimal sampling method and training set configurations to obtain high accuracy in ML-based liquefaction prediction.</description>

      <title>Coherent Source Subsampling: A Data-Driven Strategy for Restoring Causal-Acausal Symmetry in Ambient Seismic Wavefield Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient noise tomography relies on the assumption that the seismic wavefield is equipartitioned, meaning that energy is uniformly distributed among all directions. However, in practice, ambient noise sources are highly non-uniform in both spatial and temporal dimensions, resulting in biased estimation of the Green's function between stations. We introduce a data-driven method, Coherent Source Subsampling (CSS), which selects and averages only those cross-correlation time windows that are associated with the excitation of sources in the stationary-zone. By confining the ensemble average to these coherent subsets, CSS effectively mitigates the influence of anisotropic or intermittent sources and restores causal-acausal symmetry in the retrieved Green's functions. Applications to regional-scale ambient noise datasets demonstrate that CSS boosts inter-station coherence and enhances the reliability of surface-wave dispersion measurements, providing a physically interpretable bridge between source statistics and noise correlation theory.</description>

      <title>An analytical framework for atmospheric tides on rocky planets. I. Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric thermal tides arise from the diurnal contrast in stellar irradiation. They exert a significant influence on the long-term rotational evolution of rocky planets because they can accelerate the planetary spin, thereby counteracting the decelerating effect of classical gravitational tides. Consequently, equilibrium tide-locked states may emerge, as exemplified by Venus and hypothesised for Precambrian Earth. Quantifying the atmospheric thermal torque and elucidating its dependence on tidal frequency -- both in the low- and high-frequency regimes -- is therefore essential. In particular, we focus here on the resonance that affected early Earth, which is associated with a forced Lamb wave. Within the framework of linear theory, we develop a new analytical model of the atmospheric response to both gravitational an thermal tidal forcings for two representative vertical temperature profiles that bracket the atmospheres of rocky planets: (i) an isothermal profile (uniform temperature) and (ii) an isentropic profile (uniform potential temperature). Dissipative processes are incorporated via Newtonian cooling. We demonstrate that the isothermal and isentropic cases are governed by the same general closed-form solution, and we derive explicit expressions for the three-dimensional tidal fields (pressure, temperature, density and wind velocities) throughout the spherical atmospheric shell. These results constitute the foundation for two forthcoming papers, in which analytical formulae for the thermotidal torque will be presented and compared with numerical solutions obtained from General Circulation Models (GCMs).</description>
