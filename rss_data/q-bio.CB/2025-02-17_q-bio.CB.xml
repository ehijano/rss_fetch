      <title>DiffEx: Explaining a Classifier with Diffusion Models to Identify Microscopic Cellular Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have been extensively applied to biological data across various modalities. Discriminative deep learning models have excelled at classifying images into categories (e.g., healthy versus diseased, treated versus untreated). However, these models are often perceived as black boxes due to their complexity and lack of interpretability, limiting their application in real-world biological contexts. In biological research, explainability is essential: understanding classifier decisions and identifying subtle differences between conditions are critical for elucidating the effects of treatments, disease progression, and biological processes. To address this challenge, we propose DiffEx, a method for generating visually interpretable attributes to explain classifiers and identify microscopic cellular variations between different conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffEx in explaining classifiers trained on natural and biological images. Furthermore, we use DiffEx to uncover phenotypic differences within microscopy datasets. By offering insights into cellular variations through classifier explanations, DiffEx has the potential to advance the understanding of diseases and aid drug discovery by identifying novel biomarkers.</description>

      <title>CellFlow: Simulating Cellular Morphology Changes via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlow, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlow models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlow generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlow enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research.</description>
