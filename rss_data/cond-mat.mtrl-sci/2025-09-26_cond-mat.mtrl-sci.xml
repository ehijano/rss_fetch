      <title>Tailoring properties of Heusler alloys by elemental substitution and electron counting: (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Mn$_\alpha$)FeGe, Co$_2$(Fe$_{1-\beta}$Mn$_{\beta}$)Ge, and (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Fe$_\alpha$)MnGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational material design by elemental substitution is useful in tailoring materials to have desirable properties. Here we consider three non-equivalent substitutional series based on Co$_2$FeGe, viz; (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Mn$_\alpha$)FeGe, Co$_2$(Fe$_{1-\beta}$Mn$_{\beta}$)Ge, (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Fe$_\alpha$)MnGe ($0\!\le\!\alpha\!\le\!2, 0\!\le\!\beta\!\le\!1$), and study how material properties evolve with the interchange of Mn, Fe, and Co in Co$_2$FeGe. In all three schemes, single-phase compounds can be obtained over a wide range of compositions: $0.125 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1.375 $ for (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Mn$_{\alpha}$)FeGe, $0 \!\le\! \beta \!\le\! 1$ for Co$_2$(Fe$_{1-\beta}$Mn$_{\beta}$)Ge, and $0 \!&lt;\! \alpha \!&lt;\! 1.50$ for (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Fe$_\alpha$)MnGe. All the single-phase compounds crystallise in fcc structure with chemical ordering consistent with the ``4-2'' rule of Butler et al. The compounds are soft ferromagnets with low temperature saturation magnetisation agreeing with the Slater-Pauling rule. Very high Curie temperatures are measured, with values up to 1000 K for lower Mn concentrations. First principle calculations indicate, in the most stable atomic configuration, Mn prefers sharing sublattice with Ge, also consistent with the 4-2 rule. The calculations further predict half-metallic behaviour for (Co$_{1.625}$Mn$_{0.375}$)FeGe, while finding other compositions to be nearly half-metallic. Upon comparing the results of the three series, it is found that single-phase alloys occur for a specific range of valence electrons per unit cell ($\sim\!28.5\!-\!29.75$), and that even for multi-phase samples the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties depend primarily on the number of valence electrons and not on the specific substitution scheme employed.</description>

      <title>Negative Charge Transfer: Ground State Precursor towards High Energy Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern energy applications, especially electric vehicles, demand high energy batteries. However, despite decades of intensive efforts, the highest energy density and commercially viable batteries are still based on LiCoO2, the very first generation of cathode materials. The technical bottleneck is the stability of oxide-based cathodes at high operating voltages. The fundamental puzzle is that we actually never understood the redox mechanism of LiCoO2. Conventional wisdom generally defines redox to be centered on cations at low voltages, and on anions, i.e. oxygen, at high voltages by forming oxidized chemical states like O2 or peroxo-species. Here, through in-situ and ex-situ spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations, we show that high-energy layered cathodes, represented by LiCoO2 and LiNiO2, operate through enhancement of negative charge transfer (NCT) ground states upon charging throughout the whole voltage range - i.e., NCT evolution itself is the intrinsic redox mechanism regardless of voltage ranges. NCT inherently engages high covalency and oxygen holes, leading to optimized performance without conventional redox centers in LiCoO2. The level of NCT, i.e., number of ligand holes, naturally explains many seemingly controversial results. The redefinition of redox mechanism reveals the pathway toward viable high energy battery electrodes.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Insights into Cu/amorphous-Ta$_x$N Interfacial Adhesion via Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: Effects of Stoichiometry and Interface Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate understanding and control of interfacial adhesion between Cu and Ta$_x$N diffusion barriers are essential for ensuring the mechanical reliability and integrity of Cu interconnect systems in semiconductor devices. Amorphous tantalum nitride (a-Ta$_x$N) barriers are particularly attractive due to their superior barrier performance, attributed to the absence of grain boundaries. However, a systematic atomistic investigation of how varying Ta stoichiometries influences adhesion strength at Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces remains lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of interface optimization strategies. In this study, we employ machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces. We simultaneously evaluate three distinct interface construction approaches--static relaxation, high-temperature annealing, and simulated Cu deposition--to comprehensively investigate their influence on adhesion strength across varying Ta compositions ($x=1, 2, 4$). Peak force and work of adhesion values from SMD simulations quantitatively characterize interface strength, while atomic stress and strain analyses elucidate detailed deformation behavior, highlighting the critical role of interfacial morphologies. Additionally, we explore the atomistic mechanisms underlying cohesive failure, revealing how targeted incorporation of Ta atoms into Cu layers enhances the cohesive strength of the interface. This study demonstrates how MLIP-driven simulations can elucidate atomic-scale relationships between interface morphology and adhesion behavior, providing insights that can guide future atomistic engineering strategies toward enhancing intrinsic barrier adhesion, potentially enabling liner-free interconnect technologies.</description>

      <title>Robust Ferrimagnetic Ground State and Suppressed Superconductivity in Two-Dimensional HC6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hydrogenated graphene (HC6) represents a promising platform for exploring emergent electronic phases. Owing to its high electronic density of states at the Fermi level, HC6 is expected to support phonon-mediated superconductivity, with a calculated critical temperature Tc of 37.4 K in the paramagnetic metallic phase. However, spin-polarized first-principles calculations reveal that HC6 stabilizes in a ferrimagnetic ground state, which is energetically favored by 0.175 eV per unit cell over the paramagnetic metallic phase. This large energy difference significantly exceeds kB T at room temperature, indicating robust magnetic order. Although the superconducting condensation energy lowers the total energy by about 7 meV, the superconducting phase remains metastable. These results highlight the dominant role of magnetism in HC6 and illustrate how a high electronic density of states can drive competing instabilities in hydrogenated two-dimensional materials, offering design principles for carbon-based magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metal and topological phases in the ferrovalley states of the sliding bilayer altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is characterized by non-relativistic spin splitting and zero total magnetic moments. In this work, intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metallic and topological phases were discovered within the ferrovalley states of sliding bilayer altermagnets. We construct the bilayer system by utilizing altermagnet monolayers with a small bandgap. The inter-layer hopping phenomenon leads to a reduction in bandgaps, and sliding engineering induces ferrovalley states. Taking the V$_2$OSSe system for example, first-principles calculations indicate that the spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the ferrovalley state ensures a direct gap in one valley (one spin channel) and band inversion in the other valley (opposite spin channel), which is manifested as an intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metal. The microscopic model and effective Hamiltonian employed in this research confirm the universal spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Further calculations imply the existence of Chern insulator and gapless surface states in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Adjusting the sliding direction can achieve the transition between different half-metals with conducting electrons of different spins, accompanied by the switching of gapless surface states of opposite spins. This research lays a foundation for the potential applications of intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metals and topological phases in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order tuning of excitons in the magnetic semiconductor CrCl$_3$ through strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon-exciton coupling provides an unprecedented opportunity for the optical tunability of spin information and, viceversa, for the magnetic control of the optical response. Few-layered magnets are an ideal platform for the experimental study of this coupling, in part due to the strong excitonic character of the optical response in (quasi-)two dimensions. Here, we demonstrate a strong dependence of the excitonic oscillator strength on the magnetic order in a monolayer of chromium trichloride CrCl$_3$. Solving an effective Bethe-Salpeter equation, we evaluate the changes in the excitonic response as the magnetic order switches from the ferromagnetic state to the antiferromagnetic state when strain is applied. Our results reveal an abrupt change in the spatial localization of the excitons across the transition, which translates into a strong shift and a change of the oscillator strength of the excitonic peaks. This suggests the possibility of using strain as a binary switch of the optical response in this material.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial negative thermal expansion in a weak-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase of CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discovered unique uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior for a weak-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase of CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$. CoZr$_{2}$ is known as a superconductor exhibiting uniaxial NTE along the $c$-axis, which is called anomalous thermal expansion (ATE). Additionally, CoZr$_{2}$ is also known as a well-absorbent of hydrogen, and hydrogen insertion raises weak-itinerant ferromagnetism instead of superconductivity. However, the influence of hydrogen insertion on ATE behavior in this system is still unclear. To investigate it, we performed powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) for CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$. Through Arrott plots analysis, we determined the Curie temperature ($T_{\mathrm{C}}$) to be 139 K, and the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio was estimated to be 3.49, which clearly exceeds 1, suggesting the itinerancy of emerging ferromagnetism. Temperature dependencies of lattice constants $a$ and $c$ were extracted from powder SXRD analyses, and we revealed that lattice constant $c$ exhibited NTE behavior below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The uniaxial NTE behavior along the $c$-axis can be understood by sharpening an antibonding Co3$dz^{2}$ partial density of states near the Fermi level, linked to the expansion of a one-dimensional Co-Co chain running parallel to the $c$-axis.</description>

      <title>Defect-Charge-Driven 90{\deg} Switching in HfO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnium dioxide (HfO2) is a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric showing both 180{\deg} and 90{\deg} switching, yet the microscopic nature of the 90{\deg} pathway remains unresolved. We show that the 90{\deg} rotation pathway, negligible in pristine HfO2, becomes dominant under E// [111] when induced by charged oxygen vacancies. This pathway is more fatigue-resistant than the 180{\deg} reversal pathway, while delivering the same polarization change along [111] (2Pr=60 {\mu}C/cm^2 ). This charge-driven switching arises from two factors: the crystal geometry of HfO2 and the intrinsic nature of rotational pathways, the latter suggesting a possible general tendency for defect charge to bias rotation over reversal in ferroelectrics. Together these findings reveal a pathway-level origin of fatigue resistance and establish defect charge as a general control parameter for polarization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cu2XSiS4 (X = Ge, Sn, and Pb) materials for solar-cell applications: A DFT+SCAPS-1D simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of the first-principles density functional theory (DFT), I2-II-IV-VI4 type Cu-based quaternary chalcogenides Cu 2 XSiS 4 (X = Ge, Sn, and Pb) have been thoroughly investigated. We report the study of Ge and Sn substitution in the divalent cation site for their potential applications in photovoltaics for the first time. The structural, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties have been calculated. The structural and thermal stability is verified by calculating the elastic constants, formation energy and total potential energy at 300 K from the ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The compounds under our investigation exhibited an indirect band gap in the range of 1.0--1.56 eV, suitable for energy harvesting by trapping the sunlight. The presence of absorption peaks within the visible region complements their potential in photovoltaic applications. For further validation, we have designed a model of a heterostructure (FTO/TiO2/Cu2XSiS4/CuO/Au) solar cell, and a numerical simulation has been performed by solving the Poisson equation and continuity equations to obtain the I-V characteristic by using SCAPS-1D. All the inputs needed for solar- cell simulation in SCAPS-1D have been taken from the DFT results. The corresponding Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) is denoted by {\eta}% and their respective values for X=Ge, Sn and Pb are 23.46%, 23.29% and 22.60%, at room temperature. The Ge-based system exhibits the highest {\eta}%, owing to its band gap value in the visible range of the solar spectrum. Thus, we report that Ge-based compounds may act as a promising absorber layer in heterostructure solar-cell applications.</description>

      <title>SMC-X: A Distributed Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation Method for Chemically Complex Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To predict the complex chemical evolution in multicomponent alloys, it is highly desirable to have accurate atomistic simulation methods capable of reaching sufficiently large spatial and temporal scales. In this work, we advance the recently proposed SMC-X method through distributed computation on either GPUs or CPUs, pushing both spatial and temporal scales of atomistic simulation of chemically complex alloys to previously inaccessible scales. This includes a 16-billion-atom HEA system extending to the micrometer regime in space, and a 1-billion-atom HEA evolved over more than three million Monte Carlo swap steps, approaching the minute regime in time. We show that such large-scale simulations are essential for bridging the gap between experimental observations and theoretical predictions of the nanoprecipitate sizes in HEAs, based on analysis using the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory for diffusion-controlled coarsening. This work demonstrates the great potential of SMC-X for simulation-driven exploration of the chemical complexity in high-entropy materials at large spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>Computing finite--temperature elastic constants with noise cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic constants are central material properties, frequently reported in experimental and theoretical studies. While their computation is straightforward in the absence of thermal fluctuations, finite--temperature methods often suffer from poor signal--to--noise ratios or the presence of strong anharmonic effects. Here, we show how to compute elastic constants in thermal ordered and disordered systems by generalizing a noise--cancellation method originally developed for piezoelectric coupling coefficients. A slight strain is applied to an equilibrated solid. Simulations of both the strained and unstrained (or oppositely strained) reference systems are performed using identical thermostatting schemes. As demonstrated theoretically and with generic one--dimensional models, this allows stress differences to be evaluated and elastic constants to be determined with much reduced thermal noise. We then apply this approach across a diverse set of systems, spanning crystalline argon, ordered silicon as well as amorphous silicon, poly(methyl methacrylate), and cellulose derivatives.</description>

      <title>A GND-based back stress model for reverse loading in metal sheets with consideration of GNB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of springback and formability in sheet metal forming requires understanding reverse loading behavior under complex loading path changes, such as tension followed by compression. However, for ultra-thin sheets experimental characterization of such behavior is difficult due to compressive instability like plastic buckling. This study presents a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) incorporating a physically motivated back stress model based on geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) and boundaries (GNBs). The model captures grain size effects, including the Hall-Petch and Bauschinger effects, through a single grain size-dependent back stress parameter, enabling reverse loading prediction using only tensile data from specimens with different grain sizes. The back stress parameter was calibrated by fitting tensile stress-strain curves from two microstructures - one as-received and one annealed. Without using Tension-Compression (T-C) data for calibration, the model accurately predicted reverse loading behavior in low-carbon steel (0.64 mm thick) and Tension-Bending (T-B) responses in ultra-thin SUS316 (0.083 mm thick) when the developed theory was incorporated to an upscaled anisotropic hardening model. Identifiability analysis confirmed that the model parameters are uniquely determined by the available data. This physically interpretable framework provides an efficient and robust means to predict reverse loading in thin metal sheets, overcoming experimental limitations.</description>

      <title>Avalanche-like lithium intercalation and intraparticle correlations in graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphite is the most widely used anode material in lithium-ion batteries with over 98% market share. However, despite its first application over 30 years ago, the lithium insertion processes and associated dynamics in graphite remain poorly understood, especially for the dilute stages. A fundamental understanding of how the symmetry-breaking phase transitions occur pseudo-continuously under operating conditions is still lacking. Here, we provide a unified picture of ion intercalation dynamics during the dilute stages of graphite intercalation, using operando optical microscopy combined with random field Ising modelling. We show that during the dilute stages, single graphite particle undergoes rapid, localised avalanche-like (de)intercalation, leading to micron-sized regions (de)intercalating within seconds. These avalanches are reminiscent of phase transition behaviour seen in disordered materials such as martensitic transformations, Barkhausen noise and ferroelectric/elastic materials - associated with step changes in the order parameter, where the system changes from one phase to another under an applied driving force by jumping from one metastable state to another. Here, using a modified random field Ising model, we relate these avalanches to static disorder in graphite, which disrupts ion filling dynamics, leading to pseudo-continuous transitions between stages, accounting for the experimental electrochemistry profile as well as the temperature dependent avalanche dynamics. Finally, we develop a methodology to spatio-temporally analyse avalanches between intraparticle regions, revealing spatially heterogeneous connectivity and temporal patterns between regions during the dilute stages. Our work highlights the role of local and static disorder in eliciting unexpected phase transition behaviour, and provides new tools and concepts for studying layered battery materials.</description>

      <title>Low Temperature MOCVD Synthesis of high-mobility 2D InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) indium selenide (InSe) is a layered semiconductor with high electron mobility and a tunable band gap ranging from 1.25 eV in the bulk to 2.8 eV in the monolayer limit. These properties make these materials strong candidates for future logic and optoelectronic devices. However, growing phase-pure InSe remains challenging due to the complex indium-selenium (In-Se) phase diagram. This complexity and the sensitivity of chemical precursors to growth conditions make it difficult to control which In-Se phase forms during synthesis during, e.g., metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Despite the challenges, MOCVD is considered the most promising approach for growing InSe, as it enables wafer-scale, uniform, and controllable deposition-key requirements for device integration. In this study, we present a systematic investigation of InSe synthesis via MOCVD on c-plane sapphire substrates at low temperatures, which are highly relevant for various integration schemes. By varying the Se/In precursor ratio and the growth temperature, we create a phase diagram that covers the In-rich, equal stoichiometric, and Se-rich InxSey phases. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, supported by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirm conditions, under which the formation of 2D InSe is observed. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy also reveals an epitaxial alignment of the InSe with the sapphire substrate mediated by a specific interface reconstruction. The epitaxial alignment is verified by in-plane X-ray diffraction across large length scales. Samples grown under optimized conditions exhibit a strong optical absorption in the visible range and especially a comparably high electron mobility underlining the potential of the MOCVD-grown material for future applications.</description>

      <title>Topological nontrivial berry phase in altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of topological properties in magnetic materials has long been one of the forefront research areas in condensed matter physics. CrSb, as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism, has attracted significant attention due to its unique magnetic properties. This system provides a novel platform for exploring the intrinsic relationship between altermagnetic order and exotic topological states. In this study, we combine systematic electrical transport experiments with first-principles calculations to investigate the possible realization mechanisms of topological semimetal states in CrSb and their manifestations in quantum transport phenomena. Our high field magneto-transport measurements reveal that the magnetoresistance of CrSb exhibits no sign of saturation up to 35 T, following a distinct power-law dependence with an exponent of 1.48. The nonlinear Hall resistivity further indicates a multiband charge transport mechanism. Under high magnetic fields, we observe pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations and discernible Zeeman-effect-induced band splitting at 1.6 K. Systematic Fermi surface and band calculations combined with Berry phase analysis confirm the nontrivial topological character of this material (with a Berry phase approaching {\pi}). These findings not only provide crucial experimental evidence for understanding the electronic structure of CrSb, but also establish an important foundation for investigating topological quantum states in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>AI-Guided Quantum Material Simulator for Education. Case Example: The Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching and learning in advanced materials science are often limited by two barriers: the technical complexity of quantum-mechanical simulations and the lack of individualized support in inquiry-based education. Here, we introduce the Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025 (NMC2025), a command-line platform that integrates a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tutor with automated simulation workflows. NMC2025 combines large language model (LLM) guidance, real-time literature feedback, and domain-specific computation to create an adaptive learning environment. The system includes modular Python components for material discovery, simulation parameter optimization, and automated input generation for Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the tool enables students to carry out authentic research tasks such as identifying candidate materials for neuromorphic memristors or tuning density functional theory (DFT) inputs, while receiving context-aware explanations from the AI tutor. A case study illustrates how iterative, AI-guided refinement of hypotheses and calculations enhances both accuracy and understanding. NMC2025 fosters deeper conceptual insight, independent exploration, and smooth transfer of research methods into the classroom. This approach highlights the potential of AI-augmented education to reduce barriers to complex simulations and to expand access to computational modeling across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</description>

      <title>Magnon-magnon coupling efficiency of $\eta$=0.5 in weakly pinned synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) consist of two ferromagnetic layers that are antiferromagnetically coupled. These systems support complex dynamical magnetic excitations, where interlayer coupling gives rise to both in-phase (acoustic) and anti-phase (optical) magnonic modes. Typically, simultaneous excitation of both modes requires breaking the symmetry between the ferromagnetic layers -- commonly achieved through slight misalignment of the experimental setup or by modifying the intrinsic magnetic properties. In our approach, we utilize a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet (pSAF), where one of the ferromagnetic layers is exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnet. We demonstrate that by tuning the thickness of the antiferromagnet and slightly enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer, both acoustic and optical modes can be efficiently excited -- without the need for experimental misalignment or changes to the intrinsic material properties. Under specific conditions, the magnon dispersion relations exhibit anti-crossing behavior, resulting in the emergence of a magnonic bandgap -- a clear signature of strong magnon-magnon coupling. The coupling efficiency $\eta$, defined as the ratio between the bandgap and the characteristic frequency, reaches $\eta = 0.5$, approaching the ultra-strong coupling regime ($\eta = 1$). The combination of strong mode hybridization, a sizable magnonic bandgap, and high ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) coherence over large areas -- all achieved at room temperature without cryogenic cooling -- underscores the potential of these systems for quantum magnonic applications, including quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized molecular and materials modeling, but existing benchmarks suffer from data leakage, limited transferability, and an over-reliance on error-based metrics tied to specific density functional theory (DFT) references. We introduce MLIP Arena, a benchmark platform that evaluates force field performance based on physics awareness, chemical reactivity, stability under extreme conditions, and predictive capabilities for thermodynamic properties and physical phenomena. By moving beyond static DFT references and revealing the important failure modes of current foundation MLIPs in real-world settings, MLIP Arena provides a reproducible framework to guide the next-generation MLIP development toward improved predictive accuracy and runtime efficiency while maintaining physical consistency. The Python package and online leaderboard are available at https://github.com/atomind-ai/mlip-arena.</description>

      <title>Stray light in 3D porous nanostructures of single crystalline copper film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the design of optical devices and components, geometric structures and optical properties of materials, such as absorption, refraction, reflection, diffraction, scattering, and trapping, have been utilized. Finding the ideal material with certain optical and geometric characteristics is essential for a customized application. Here, we fabricated unoxidizable achromatic copper films (ACFs) on Al2O3 substrates utilizing an atomic sputtering epitaxy apparatus. ACFs are made up of two regions vertically: a comparatively flat layer region and a three-dimensional (3D) porous nanostructured region on top of the flat region. The measured specular reflectance displayed low-pass filter behaviour with a sharp cutoff frequency in the infrared spectrum. Furthermore, the measured diffusive reflectance spectra showed light-trapping behaviour in the spectral region above the cutoff frequency, where there are no known absorption mechanisms, such as phonons and interband transitions. A focused ion beam scanning electron microscope was utilized to study the thin film's nanostructured region through 3D tomographic analysis in order to comprehend the phenomena that were observed. This work will shed fresh light on the design and optimization of optical filters and light-trapping employing porous nanostructured metallic thin films.</description>

      <title>Effect of C additives with 0.5% in weight on structural, optical and superconducting properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti high entropy alloy films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the superconducting (SC) properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti high-entropy alloy (HEA) thin films with 0.5% weight C additives. The C additives stabilize the structural properties and enhance the SC critical properties, including $\mu_0$Hc$_2$ (13.45 T) and Tc (7.5 K). The reflectance of the C-added HEA film is enhanced in the low-energy region, resulting in a higher optical conductivity, which is consistent with the lower electrical resistivity. In addition, we observed SC vortices in the C-added HEA film using magnetic force microscopy. The magnetic penetration depths ($\lambda$) of the pure HEA and C-added HEA films were estimated from their Meissner force curves by comparing them with those of a reference Nb film. At 4.2 K, the {\lambda} of the C-added film is 360 nm, shorter than that of the pure HEA film (560 nm), indicating stronger superconductivity against an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Spin band geometry drives intrinsic thermal spin magnetization and current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating spin magnetization and spin currents without magnetic or electric fields is a key frontier in spin caloritronics. Spin responses driven by thermal gradients offer a promising route, though the band geometric origin of intrinsic mechanisms, especially in non-magnetic materials, remains poorly understood. Here we develop a unified quantum theory of thermal spin magnetization and spin currents in itinerant electrons, rooted in spin band geometry with both Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea contributions. We identify two key geometric quantities: the spin-velocity metric tensor, which governs thermal spin magnetization, and the spin geometric tensor, combining spin Berry curvature and spin quantum metric, which generates thermal spin currents. These intrinsic contributions persist and can even dominate in non-magnetic insulators. Numerical calculations for chiral metal RhGe and antiferromagnet CuMnAs demonstrate sizable thermal spin responses near band crossings. Our results establish the band geometric origin of thermal spin transport and provide guiding principles for discovering and engineering next-generation spin caloritronic materials.</description>

      <title>Peak separation methods for inverse photoelectron spectra: Comparing second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) is a powerful technique for probing the unoccupied electronic states of materials. It can be regarded as the inversion process of photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), which examines the occupied states. Recently developed low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (LEIPS) can significantly advance the study of unoccupied states, owing to an improved signal-to-noise ratio and minimal sample damage compared to conventional IPES. However, the instrumental resolution remains at 0.2 eV, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of PES. Spectral broadening caused by the low instrumental resolution often results in overlapping peaks. Peak separation is therefore crucial in the analysis of LEIPS spectra. In this study, we compared three peak separation methods: second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution. These methods were applied to modeled and experimental LEIPS spectra of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-derived band of pentacene, which consists of two splitting peaks due to the two inequivalent molecules in the unit cell. We systematically and quantitatively evaluated the performance of each method in terms of analysis parameters and discussed its robustness to noise as well as its peak separation capability. This work offers a practical framework for peak separation in LEIPS, with extensions to PES and a wide range of spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of ultra-flat band in van der Waals kagome semiconductor Pd3P2(S1-xSex)8</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.11222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolutions of structural parameters, optical properties, and electronic structures of van der Waals kagome semiconductor Pd3P2S8 with Se doping. When the doping level of Se increases, the bandgaps of Pd3P2(S1-xSex)8 single crystals decrease gradually, accompanying with the expanded unit cells. The first-principles calculations show that there is a flat band (FB) near the Fermi level in bulk Pd3P2S8. This FB mainly originates from the dz2-like orbitals of Pd atoms in the Pd kagome lattice, which has a finite interlayer electron hopping perpendicular to the PdS4 square plane. The interlayer hopping can be reinforced with the Se doping, inducing a stronger interlayer coupling via the chalcogen atoms at apical sites, which reduces the bandgap and enhances the cleavage energy. In contrast, the vanishing interlayer hopping in the two-dimensional limit results in the formation of ultra-FB in the monolayers of these compounds. The easy exfoliation and the existence of unique ultra-FB near EF make Pd3P2(S1-xSex)8 a model system to explore the exotic physics of FB in two-dimensional kagome lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a pinning-controlled permanent magnet, tailoring the cellular nanostructure of samarium-cobalt-based 1:7-type (SmCo-1:7) magnets remains crucial for improving magnetic performance. Jointing forward and inverse machine learning models with the high-throughput micromagnetic simulations (42,300 runs), we identify the nanostructural and magnetic features that are most effective for coercivity, combining both nucleation and pinning mechanisms. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the 1:5-phase enhances coercivity by providing high anisotropy, and the Z-phase strengthens pinning through fluctuations in domain wall energy. Cu additions in the 1:5-phase significantly reduce coercivity, while Fe substitutions in the 2:17-phase modestly reduce coercivity but improve pinning locally and increase saturation magnetization. Among all examined features, magnetocrystalline misorientation emerges as the dominant factor. Finally, the framework enables the inverse design of nanostructures with prescribed coercivity, demonstrating a computationally cost-effective toolkit for guiding the performance tailoring of SmCo-1:7 magnets.</description>

      <title>The Northeast Materials Database for Magnetic Materials</title>

Abstract: The discovery of magnetic materials with high operating temperature ranges and optimized performance is essential for advanced applications. Current data-driven approaches are limited by the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 67,573 magnetic materials entries(www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, we trained machine learning models to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (N\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 (0.83) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 56K (38K). These models identified 25 (13) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\'eel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models to accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism in resonant photoelectron diffraction as a direct probe of sublattice magnetization in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials that are promising for spintronics technology. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, the circular dichroism (CD) in resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) contains a time-reversal odd signal, which provides a direct probe of the sublattice magnetization. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L$_{2,3}$-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large magnetic CD is found for light helicity parallel to the N\'eel vector. This signal has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the X-ray magnetic CD in absorption of a single sublattice, thus providing a direct probe of the local magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and hinge states of strained half-Heusler compounds LiSbZn and LiBiZn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Half-Heusler compounds are a class of materials with great potential for the study of distinct electronic states. In this work, we investigate, from first-principles, the possibility of hinge modes in closely related topological phases that are tunable by moderate uni-axial strain. We consider two compounds: LiSbZn and LiBiZn. While LiSbZn has a topologically trivial band structure, the larger spin-orbit coupling of Bi causes a band inversion in LiBiZn. We predict the existence of topologically trivial hinge states in both cases. The hinge modes are affected by both the crystal termination, and the bulk topological phase transitions, albeit indirectly: When present, topological surface modes hybridize with the hinge states and obscure their visibility. Thus, we find that the most visible hinge modes occur when no band inversions are present in the material. Our work highlights the interplay and competition between surface and hinge modes in half-Heuslers, and may help guide the experimental search for robust boundary signatures in these materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Cost Reduction in Spin-dependent Stochastic GW Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the stochastic GW (sGW) formalism to fully spin-polarized systems, encompassing both collinear and non-collinear spin configurations. For non-collinear systems-where Kohn-Sham states are complex two-component spinors-we develop a complex-valued stochastic basis that preserves the real-valued external stochastic charge applied at time zero. This basis enables an unbiased evaluation of the random-phase approximation (RPA) screened interaction for spinors. Through error analysis and tests on real materials, we show that the performance of collinear sGW retains the same time complexity as the spin-unpolarized sGW . The non-collinear sGW incurs a computational cost two to three times higher than the spin-unpolarized version, while preserving linear scaling with low multiplicity. By unifying collinear and non-collinear treatments within a single scalable framework, our work paves the way for routine many-body predictions in large scale magnetic and spin-orbit-coupled material systems.</description>

      <title>DiffSyn: A Generative Diffusion Approach to Materials Synthesis Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. DiffSyn generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. DiffSyn achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply DiffSyn to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using DiffSyn-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.</description>

      <title>Rich unconventional Hall effects in a single quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that electronic correlation, geometric frustration, and topology, \textit{individually}, can facilitate the emergence of various intriguing properties that have attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. Here, we report a series of unconventional Hall effects observed in a \textit{single} compound - quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$. In the paramagnetic phase, signature of dynamic $c$-$f$ hybridization is revealed by a reduction of anomalous Hall effect and is connected to frustration-promoted incoherent Kondo scattering. A large topological Hall effect exceeding 0.2 $\mu\Omega\cdot$cm is found at low temperatures, which should be ascribed to the non-collinear magnetic texture. In addition, a peculiar loop-shaped Hall effect with switching chirality is also seen, which is inferred to be associated with magnetic domain walls that pin history-dependent spin chirality and / or Fermi-arc surface states projected from the in-gap Weyl nodes. These exotic results place Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$ in a regime of highly-frustrated antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice with a nontrivial topology on an ``extended" global phase diagram, and highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, geometric frustration and topology.</description>

      <title>Probing Vortex Dynamics in 2D Superconductors with Scanning Quantum Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and transport in materials with flat bands: 2D materials and quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are due to specific atomic order effects without electron interactions. These states are always indicative of some form of confinement and have consequences on the electronic properties. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene (TBG) or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms). We have shown that their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In the case of TBG, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on two-dimensional nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>"DIVE" into Hydrogen Storage Materials Discovery with AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures. We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30% relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000 entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>
