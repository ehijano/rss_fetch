      <title>Design principles of the cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate infected or malignant cells, safeguarding surrounding tissues. Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast a T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. We demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. This model explains experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion regulation in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens ("quality") and the abundance ("quantity") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells. Our findings offer a unified control-logic for cytotoxic T-cell responses and point to specific regulatory programs that can be engineered for more robust T-cell therapies.</description>

      <title>Surface Optimisation Governs the Local Design of Physical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain's connectome and the vascular system are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout, and ultimately their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organisation. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of length and volume minimisation. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimisation problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimisation onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory, predicting that with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimisation. Specifically, surface minimisation predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organisation of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which not only are prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi.</description>

      <title>TopoSPAM: Topology grounded Simulation Platform for morphogenesis and biological Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes across scales.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Directional Recognition-Driven Self-Assembly of Histone Octamer and Chromatin Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center Recognition potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <title>Anti-hyperuniform Critical States of Active Topological Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are fundamental to the collective dynamics of non-equilibrium systems and in active matter, mediating spontaneous flows, dynamic self-organization, and emergent pattern formation. Here, we reveal critical states in active nematics, marked by slowed defect density relaxation, amplified fluctuations, and heightened sensitivity to activity. Near criticality, defect interactions become long-ranged, scaling with system size, and the system enters an anti-hyperuniform regime with giant number fluctuations of topological defects and defect clustering. This transition reflects a dual scaling behavior: fluctuations are uniform at small scales but become anti-hyperuniform at larger scales, \tm{as supported by experimental measurements on large-field-of-view endothelial monolayers. We find that these anti-hyperuniform states with multiscale defect density fluctuations are robust to varying parameters, introducing frictional damping, and changing boundary conditions.} Finally, we show that the observed anti-hyperuniformity originates from defect clustering, distinguishing this transition from defect-unbinding or phase separation processes. Beyond fundamental implications for non-equilibrium systems, these results may inform biological contexts where topological defects are integral to processes such as morphogenesis and collective cellular self-organization.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Level Prototyping Tools for CMOS Bioelectronic Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating biology with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors can enable highly parallel measurements with minimal parasitic effects, significantly enhancing sensitivity. However, realizing this potential often requires overcoming substantial barriers related to design, fabrication, and heterogeneous integration. In this context, we present a comprehensive suite of tools and methods designed for wafer-scale biosensor prototyping that is sensitive, highly parallelizable, and manufacturable. A central component of our approach is a new initiative that allows for open-source multi-project wafers (MPW), giving all participants access to the designs submitted by others. We demonstrate that this strategy not only promotes design reuse but also facilitates advanced back-end-of-line (BEOL) fabrication techniques, improving the manufacturability and process yield of CMOS biosensors. Developing CMOS-based biosensors also involves the challenge of heterogeneous integration, which includes external electrical, mechanical, and fluid layers. We demonstrate simple modular designs that enable such integration for sample delivery and signal readout. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in measuring the hybridization of DNA molecules by focusing on data acquisition and machine learning (ML) methods that leverage the parallelism of the sensors to enable robust classification of desirable analyte interactions.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and multistability in inducible three-gene toggle switch networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control of transcription presides over a vast array of biological processes including through gene regulatory circuits that exhibit multistability. Two- and three-gene network motifs are often found to be critical parts of the repertoire of metabolic and developmental pathways. Theoretical models of these circuits, however, typically vary parameters such as dissociation constants, transcription rates, and degradation rates without specifying precisely how these parameters are controlled biologically. In this paper, we examine the role of effector molecules, which can alter the concentrations of the active transcription factors that control regulation, and are ubiquitous to regulatory processes across biological settings. We specifically consider allosteric regulation in the context of extending the standard bistable switch to three-gene networks, and explore the rich multistable dynamics exhibited in these architectures as a function of effector concentrations. We then study how the conditions required for tristability and more complex dynamics, and the bifurcations in dynamic phase space upon tuning effector concentrations, evolve under various interpretations of regulatory circuit mechanics, the underlying activity of inducers, and perturbations thereof. Notably, the biological mechanism by which we model effector control over dual-function proteins transforms not only the phenotypic trend of dynamic tuning but also the set of available dynamic regimes. In this way, we determine key parameters and regulatory features that drive phenotypic decisions, and offer an experimentally tunable structure for encoding inducible multistable behavior arising from both single and dual-function allosteric transcription factors.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution, resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size -- shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Collective transport efficiency of microswimmer swarms optimized by tactic run-tumble dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective motion of microorganisms and microrobots can be used for particle delivery, especially when guided by external magnetic fields, phototaxis, or chemotaxis. This cargo transport is enhanced significantly by hydrodynamic entrainment, where the surrounding fluid and any dissolved molecules or suspended cargo particles are dragged along with a collectively moving swarm. However, it remains unclear how this directed entrainment is affected by stochastic run-tumble motion, and how such motility patterns couple to particle dispersion. Here, we combine theory and simulations to compute the entrainment velocity and diffusivity for different degrees of swimmer directedness. Surprisingly, we find that the transport efficiency P\'{e}clet number, the ratio of advective to diffusive transport, is optimal for intermediate directedness values, so perfectly guided active suspensions perform worse than those with stochastic reorientations. These results could have implications for microrobotic drug delivery and nutrient transport in microbial environments.</description>

      <title>Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</description>
