      <title>Optimizing measurement tradeoffs in multiparameter spatial superresolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound for the joint estimation of the centroid and the separation between two incoherent point sources cannot be saturated. As such, the optimal measurements for extracting maximal information about both at the same time are not known. In this work, we ascertain these optimal measurements for an arbitrary point spread function, in the most relevant regime of a small separation between the sources. Our measurement can be adjusted within a set of tradeoffs, allowing more information to be extracted from the separation or the centroid while ensuring that the total information is the maximum possible.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly interacting dissipative systems and digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital quantum computers promise to solve important and challenging problems in many-body quantum physics. However, at least for the superconducting platforms, their current limitation is the noise level. It thus seems more reasonable to presently use them to model dissipative systems, where platforms' native noise is not that crucial. Here, we propose using a digital quantum computer to showcase the activation of integrability by realizing exotic generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly dissipative integrable systems. Dissipation is realized by coupling system's qubits to periodically reset ancilla ones, like in the protocol recently used to realize dissipative cooling. We derive the effective equations of motion for trotterized dynamics and contrast such a setup to the usual Lindblad continuous evolution. For simplicity, we consider and compare different approaches to calculating steady-states of non-interacting integrable systems weakly coupled to baths, where thermodynamic results can be obtained via a generalized scattering theory between the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Corresponding quantum computer implementation would illuminate the possibilities of realizing similar exotic states in nearly integrable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Cheaper and more noise-resilient quantum state preparation using eigenvector continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace methods are powerful, noise-resilient methods that can effectively prepare ground states on quantum computers. The challenge is to get a subspace with a small condition number that spans the states of interest using minimal quantum resources. In this work, we will use eigenvector continuation (EC) to build a subspace from the low-lying states of a set of Hamiltonians. The basis vectors are prepared using truncated versions of standard state preparation methods such as imaginary time evolution (ITE) and adiabatic state preparation (ASP). By using these truncated methods combined with eigenvector continuation, we can directly improve upon them, obtaining more accurate ground state energies at a reduced cost. We use several spin systems to demonstrate convergence even when methods like ITE and ASP fail, such as ASP in the presence of level crossings and ITE with vanishing energy gaps. We also showcase the noise resilience of this approach beyond the gains already made by having a shallower quantum circuit. Our findings suggest that eigenvector continuation can be used to improve existing state preparation methods in the near term.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant embedding of quantum circuits on hardware architectures via swap gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In near-term quantum computing devices, connectivity between qubits remain limited by architectural constraints. A computational circuit with given connectivity requirements necessary for multi-qubit gates have to be embedded within physical hardware with fixed connectivity. Long-distance gates have to be done by first routing the relevant qubits together. The simplest routing strategy involves the use of swap gates to swap the information carried by two unconnected qubits to connected ones. Ideal swap gates just permute the qubits; real swap gates, however, have the added possibilities of causing simultaneous errors on the qubits involved and spreading errors across the circuit. A general swap scheme thus changes the error-propagation properties of a circuit, including those necessary for fault-tolerant functioning of a circuit. Here, we present a simple strategy to design the swap scheme needed to embed an abstract circuit onto a physical hardware with constrained connectivity, in a manner that preserves the fault-tolerant properties of the abstract circuit. The embedded circuit will, of course, be noisier, compared to a native implementation of the abstract circuit, but we show in the examples of embedding surface codes on heavy-hexagonal and hexagonal lattices that the deterioration is not severe. This then offers a straightforward solution to implementing circuits with fault-tolerance properties on current hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.</description>

      <title>The Infinite-Dimensional Quantum Entropy: the Unified Entropy Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a use of the Fredholm determinant theory, the unified quantum entropy notion has been extended to a case of infinite-dimensional systems. Some of the known (in the finite-dimensional case) basic properties of the introduced unified entropies have been extended to the case study. Certain numerical approaches for computing the proposed finite and infinite-dimensional entropies are being outlined as well.</description>

      <title>Divergences in classical and quantum linear response and equation of motion formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating molecular properties using quantum devices can be done through the quantum linear response (qLR) or, equivalently, the quantum equation of motion (qEOM) formulations. Different parameterizations of qLR and qEOM are available, namely naive, projected, self-consistent, and state-transfer. In the naive and projected parameterizations, the metric is not the identity, and we show that it depends on the redundant orbital rotations. This dependency may lead to divergences in the excitation energies for certain choices of the redundant orbital rotation parameters in an idealized noise-less setting. Further, this leads to significant variance when calculations include statistical noise from finite quantum sampling.</description>

      <title>Continuous drive heterodyne microwave sensing with spin qubits in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors that use solid state spin defects have emerged as effective probes of weak alternating magnetic signals. By recording the phase of a signal relative to an external clock, these devices can resolve signal frequencies to a precision orders of magnitude longer than the spin state lifetime. However, these quantum heterodyne protocols suffer from sub-optimal sensitivity, as they are currently limited to pulsed spin control techniques, which are susceptible to cumulative pulse-area errors, or single continuous drives which offer no protection of the spin coherence. Here, we present a control scheme based on a continuous microwave drive that extends spin coherence towards the effective $T_2 \approx \frac{1}{2}T_1$ limit and can resolve the frequency, amplitude and phase of GHz magnetic fields. The scheme is demonstrated using an ensemble of boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride, and achieves an amplitude sensitivity of $\eta \approx 3-5 \:\mathrm{\mu T \sqrt{Hz}}$ and phase sensitivity of $\eta_{\phi} \approx 0.076 \:\mathrm{rads \sqrt{Hz}}$. By repeatedly referencing the phase of a resonant signal against the coherent continuous microwave drive in a quantum heterodyne demonstration, we measure a GHz signal with a resolution $&lt;$1 Hz over a 10 s measurement. Achieving this level of performance in a two-dimensional material platform could have broad applications, from probing nanoscale condensed matter systems to integration into heterostructures for quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Quantum illumination networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum illumination is an entanglement-based target detection protocol that provides quantum advantages despite the presence of entanglement-breaking noise. However, the advantage of traditional quantum illumination protocols is limited to impractical scenarios with low transmitted power and simple target configurations. In this work, we propose a quantum illumination network to overcome the limitations, via designing a transmitter array and a single receiver antenna. Thanks to multiple transmitters, quantum advantage is achieved even with a high total transmitted power. Moreover, for single-parameter estimation, the advantage of network over a single transmitter case increases with the number of transmitters before saturation. At the same time, complex target configurations with multiple unknown transmissivity or phase parameters can be resolved. Despite the interference of different returning signals at the single antenna and photon-loss due to multiple-access channel, we provide two types of measurement design, one based on parametric-amplification and one based on the correlation-to-displacement conversion (CtoD) to achieve a quantum advantage in estimating all unknown parameters. We also generalize the parameter estimation scenario to a general hypothesis testing scenario, where the six-decibel quantum illumination advantage is achieved at a much greater total probing power.</description>

      <title>A unifying separability criterion based on extended correlation tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental inasmuch because it rephrases the quest for the classical-quantum demarcation line, and it also has potentially enormous practical applications in modern information technology. In this work, employing the approach of matrix decomposition, we introduce and formulate a practicable criterion for separability based on the correlation tensor. It is interesting that this criterion unifies several relevant separability criteria proposed before, even stronger than some of them. Theoretical analysis and detailed examples demonstrate its availability and feasibility for entanglement detection. Furthermore we build a family of entanglement witnesses using the criterion according to its linearity in the density operator space.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering paradox "2=1'' for $N$ qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox highlights the absence of a local realistic explanation for quantum mechanics, and shows the incompatibility of the local-hidden-state models with quantum theory. For $N$-qubit states, or more importantly, the $N$-qubit mixed states, we present the EPR steering paradox in the form of the contradictory equality "2=1". We show that the contradiction holds for any $N$-qubit state as long as both the pure state requirement and the measurement requirement are satisfied. This also indicates that the EPR steering paradox exists in more general cases. Finally, we give specific examples to demonstrate and analyze our arguments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MindSpore Quantum, a pioneering hybrid quantum-classical framework with a primary focus on the design and implementation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms. Leveraging the robust support of MindSpore, an advanced open-source deep learning training/inference framework, MindSpore Quantum exhibits exceptional efficiency in the design and training of variational quantum algorithms on both CPU and GPU platforms, delivering remarkable performance. Furthermore, this framework places a strong emphasis on enhancing the operational efficiency of quantum algorithms when executed on real quantum hardware. This encompasses the development of algorithms for quantum circuit compilation and qubit mapping, crucial components for achieving optimal performance on quantum processors. In addition to the core framework, we introduce QuPack-a meticulously crafted quantum computing acceleration engine. QuPack significantly accelerates the simulation speed of MindSpore Quantum, particularly in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), and tensor network simulations, providing astonishing speed. This combination of cutting-edge technologies empowers researchers and practitioners to explore the frontiers of quantum computing with unprecedented efficiency and performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate and efficient energy estimation of quantum Hamiltonians consisting of Pauli observables is an essential task in modern quantum computing. We introduce a Resource-Optimized Grouping Shadow (ROGS) algorithm, which optimally allocates measurement resources by minimizing the estimation error bound through a novel overlapped grouping strategy and convex optimization. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that ROGS requires significantly fewer unique quantum circuits for accurate estimation accuracy compared to existing methods given a fixed measurement budget, addressing a major cost factor for compiling and executing circuits on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Efficient source-independent quantum conference key agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum conference key agreement (QCKA) enables the unconditional secure distribution of conference keys among multiple participants. Due to challenges in high-fidelity preparation and long-distance distribution of multi-photon entanglement, entanglement-based QCKA is facing severe limitations in both key rate and scalability. Here, we propose a source-independent QCKA scheme utilizing the post-matching method, feasible within the entangled photon pair distribution network. We introduce an equivalent distributing virtual multi-photon entanglement protocol for providing the unconditional security proof even in the case of coherent attacks. For the symmetry star-network, comparing with previous $n$-photon entanglement protocol, the conference key rate is improved from $O(\eta^{n})$ to $O(\eta^{2})$, where $\eta$ is the transmittance from the entanglement source to one participant. Simulation results show that the performance of our protocol has multiple orders of magnitude advantages in the intercity distance. We anticipate that our approach will demonstrate its potential in the implementation of quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Negativity as a resource for memory reduction in stochastic process modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In stochastic modeling, the excess entropy -- the mutual information shared between a processes past and future -- represents the fundamental lower bound of the memory needed to simulate its dynamics. However, this bound cannot be saturated by either classical machines or their enhanced quantum counterparts. Simulating a process fundamentally requires us to store more information in the present than than what is shared between past and future. Here we consider a hypothetical generalization of hidden Markov models beyond classical and quantum models -- n-machines -- that allow for negative quasi-probabilities. We show that under the collision entropy measure of information, the minimal memory of such models can equalize the excess entropy. Our results hint negativity as a necessary resource for memory-advantaged stochastic simulation -- mirroring similar interpretations in various other quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Measuring quantum relative entropy with finite-size effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the estimation of relative entropy $D(\rho\|\sigma)$ when $\sigma$ is known. We show that the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound equals the relative varentropy. Our estimator attains the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound when the dimension $d$ is fixed. It also achieves the sample complexity $O(d^2)$ when the dimension $d$ increases. This sample complexity is optimal when $\sigma$ is the complexity mixed state. Also, it has time complexity $O(d^5 \polylog d)$. Our proposed estimator unifiedly works under both settings.</description>

      <title>Eluding Zeno effect via dephasing and detuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze some variants of the Zeno effect in which the frequent observation of the population of an intermediate state does not prevent the transition of the system from the initial state to a certain final state. The Zeno effect is eluded by means of phase shifts or detunings that tailor the dynamics by suitably altering the interference governing quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to adiabaticity improvement of STIRAP based qubit rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust quantum control is essential for the development of quantum computers, which rely on precise manipulation of qubits. One form of quantum control is stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), which ordinarily is a state transfer protocol but was extended by Kis and Renzoni (Phys. Rev. A 65, 032318 (2002)) to perform qubit rotations. Shortcut methods to adiabaticity for STIRAP have been shown to speed up adiabatic processes, beyond the adiabatic criterion, with high fidelity. Here, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity methods to the STIRAP qubit rotation scheme to improve the performance of quantum logic gates. The scheme can be implemented via direct connections between ground states in a 4-level $\Lambda$ system or effective connections in a 5-level $\Lambda$ system with modified pulses that implement transitionless quantum driving via the addition of a counterdiabatic driving term. We show that the extended shortcut to adiabaticity method serves to improve the fidelity of qubit rotations in the diabatic regime.</description>

      <title>Cavity Modified Oscillating Bound States with a $\Lambda$-type giant emitter in a linear waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system composed by a three-level giant atom (3GA), a waveguide initially in the vacuum state, and a single-mode cavity. The 3GA-cavity system is in a strong-coupling regime, and the distance between the coupling points is comparable to the coherent length of a spontaneously emitted photon. The dynamics of the 3GA and its radiative field in the waveguide for long time are analyzed. Besides the steady value, we also found an oscillatory character of the excited state population, a signature of oscillating bound states which is generated by the superposition of two bound states in the continuum. The radiative field propagates in the cavity-like geometry formed by the coupling points. When one bound state is emergent, a sine-like interference pattern is visible for the emitted field intensity in spacetime. An oscillatory character in time and a beat in space for the emitted field intensity are observed when two bound states are emergent in a subspace. The wavelengths and the periods are controlled by the number of the photons in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum Simulation of MaxCut using QAOA-in-QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a leading hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA-in-QAOA (QAOA^2) uses a divide-and-conquer heuristic to solve large-scale Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problems, where many subgraph problems can be solved in parallel. In this work, an implementation of the QAOA2 method for the scalable solution of the MaxCut problem is presented, based on the Classiq platform. The framework is executed on an HPE-Cray EX supercomputer by means of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the SLURM workload manager. The limits of the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm as a purely classical alternative to QAOA are investigated to understand if QAOA^2 could benefit from solving certain sub-graphs classically. Results from large-scale simulations of up to 33 qubits are presented, showing the advantage of QAOA in certain cases and the efficiency of the implementation, as well as the adequacy of the workflow in the preparation of real quantum devices. For the considered graphs, the best choice for the sub-graphs does not significantly improve results and is still outperformed by GW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possible squeezed states generated in a three-waveguide nonlinear coupler operating with second harmonic generation is discussed. This study is carried out using two well-known techniques; the phase space method (based on positive P-representation) and the Heisenberg-based analytical perturbative method. The effect of the key design parameters is analyzed for both codirectional and contra-directional propagation. The optimal degree of feasible squeezing is identified. Also, the performance and capacities of both methods are critically evaluated. For low levels of key design parameters and in the early stages of evolution, a high level of agreement between the two methods is noticed. In the new era of quantum-based technology, the proposed system opens a new avenue for utilising nonlinear couplers in nonclassical light generation.</description>

      <title>Markovianity and non-Markovianity of Particle Bath with Dirac Dispersion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay rate of quantum particles in open quantum systems has traditionally been known as exponential, based on empirical predictions from experiments and theoretical predictions from the Markovian dynamics of the corresponding quantum states. However, both theoretical predictions and experimental observations suggest deviations from this exponential decay, particularly in the short and long time regimes. In this study, we explore the spontaneous emission of a single Dirac particle within an environment characterized by an energy spectrum with a gap $m$ and an energy cutoff $L$. Our results reveal that high-energy structures, such as the spectral cutoff $L$, play a critical role in driving the short-time non-exponential decay. In contrast, the long-time decay is predominantly influenced by low-energy structures, such as the Dirac gap $m$. Surprisingly, we find that in the limits where the energy cutoff $L$ is infinite and the energy gap $m$ is zero, the decay dynamics of massless Dirac particles exhibit Markovian behavior without the need for conventional approximations like the Born-Markov approximation. This work underscores the complex interplay between particle energy properties and decay dynamics, providing new insights into quantum decay processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and fabricate shallow-etched periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide to realize highly-efficient broadband spontaneous parametric down-conversion~(SPDC) on nanophotonic chip. The shallow-etched waveguide is capable to tolerate the non-uniformities of waveguide width induced by fabrication imperfections, enabling generation of photon pairs with high count rate and bandwidth. We demonstrate photon-pair generation with a high brightness of 11.7~GHz/mW and bandwidth of 22~THz, in a 5.7-mm-long PPLN waveguide. The generated photon pairs exhibit strong temporal correlation with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 16262$\pm$850. Our results confirm the feasibility of shallow etching in fabrication of efficient SPDC device on platform of lithium niobate on insulator, and benefit quantum information processing with broadband photon source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with lower ranks. Originally developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML. Their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data makes them suitable for various machine learning tasks within the quantum realm. Here, we present a matrix product state (MPS) model, where the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic samples by reducing outliers. Additionally, our contributions offer insights into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks. Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling method from non-normalized MPSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If we want to transform the quantum of state of a system to another using local processes, what is the probability of success? It turns out that this probability can be bounded by quantifying entanglement within both the states. In this paper, we construct a family of multipartite entanglement measures that are monotonic under local operations and classical communication on average. The measures are constructed out of local unitary invariant polynomials of the state and its conjugate, and hence are easy to compute for pure states. Using these measures we bound the success probability of transforming a given state into another state using local quantum operations and classical communication.</description>

      <title>The SUPER excitation of quantum emitters is a multi-photon process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The swing-up of quantum emitter population (SUPER) scheme allows to populate the excited state of a quantum emitter with near-unity fidelity using two red-detuned laser pulses. Its off-resonant, yet fully coherent nature has attracted significant interest in quantum photonics as a valuable tool for preparing single-photon sources in their excited state on demand, while simultaneously ensuring straightforward spectral filtering of the laser. However, the physical understanding of this mechanism in terms of energy exchange between the electromagnetic field and the emitter is still lacking. Here, we present a fully quantized model of the swing-up excitation and demonstrate that it is in fact a multi-photon process, where one of the modes loses two or more photons while the other gains at least one. Our findings provide an unexpected physical interpretation of the SUPER scheme and unveil a new non-linear interaction between single emitters and multiple field modes.</description>

      <title>Sharing tripartite nonlocality sequentially using only projective measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17551v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality is a valuable resource in quantum information processing tasks. Scientists are interested in whether a single entangled state can generate a long sequence of nonlocal correlations. Previous work has accomplished sequential tripartite nonlocality sharing through unsharp measurements. In this paper, we investigate the sharing of tripartite nonlocality using only projective measurements and sharing classical randomness. For the generalized GHZ state, we have demonstrated that using unbiased measurement choices, two Charlies can share the standard tripartite nonlocality with a single Alice and a single Bob, while at most one Charlie can share the genuine tripartite nonlocality with a single Alice and a single Bob. However, with biased measurement choices, the number of Charlies sharing the genuine tripartite nonlocality can be increased to two. Nonetheless, we find that using biased measurements does not increase the number of sequential observers sharing the standard tripartite nonlocality. Moreover, we provide the feasible range of double violation for the parameters of the measurement combination probability with respect to the state.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Horizons From Deterministic Laws: Lessons From a Nomic Toy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory has an epistemic horizon, i.e. exact values cannot be assigned simultaneously to incompatible physical quantities. As shown by Spekkens' toy theory, positing an epistemic horizon akin to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in a classical mechanical setting also leads to a plethora of quantum phenomena. We introduce a deterministic theory - nomic toy theory - in which information gathering agents are explicitly modelled as physical systems. Our main result shows the presence of an epistemic horizon for such agents. They can only simultaneously learn the values of observables whose Poisson bracket vanishes. Therefore, nomic toy theory has incompatible measurements and the complete state of a physical system cannot be known. The best description of a system by an agent is via an epistemic state of Spekkens' toy theory. Our result reconciles us to measurement uncertainty as an aspect of the inseparability of subjects and objects. Significantly, the claims follow even though nomic toy theory is essentially classical. This work invites further investigations of epistemic horizons, such as the one of (full) quantum theory.</description>

Abstract: Reliable control of quantum information in matter-based qubits requires precisely applied external fields, and unaccounted for spatial cross-talk of these fields between adjacent qubits leads to loss of fidelity. We report a CMOS foundry-produced, micro-fabricated silicon nitride (Si3N4) optical waveguide for addressing a chain of eight, unequally-spaced trapped barium ions with crosstalk compatible with scalable quantum information processing. The crosstalk mitigation techniques incorporated into the chip design result in a reduction of the measured optical field by at least 50.8(1.3) dB between adjacent waveguide outputs near 650 nm and similar behavior for devices designed for 493 nm and 585 nm. The waveguide outputs near 650 nm, along with a global laser near 493 nm were used to laser-cool a chain of eight barium-138 ions, and a camera imaged the resulting fluorescence at 493 nm.</description>

      <title>YAQQ: Yet Another Quantum Quantizer -- Design Space Exploration of Quantum Gate Sets using Novelty Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard circuit model of quantum computation, the number and quality of the quantum gates composing the circuit influence the runtime and fidelity of the computation. The fidelity of the decomposition of quantum algorithms, represented as unitary matrices, to bounded depth quantum circuits depends strongly on the set of gates available for the decomposition routine. To investigate this dependence, we explore the design space of discrete quantum gate sets and present a software tool for comparative analysis of quantum processing units and control protocols based on their native gates. The evaluation is conditioned on a set of unitary transformations representing target use cases on the quantum processors. The cost function considers three key factors: (i) the statistical distribution of the decomposed circuits' depth, (ii) the statistical distribution of process fidelities for the approximate decomposition, and (iii) the relative novelty of a gate set compared to other gate sets in terms of the aforementioned properties. The developed software, YAQQ (Yet Another Quantum Quantizer), enables the discovery of an optimized set of quantum gates through this tunable joint cost function. To identify these gate sets, we use the novelty search algorithm, circuit decomposition techniques, and stochastic optimization to implement YAQQ within the Qiskit quantum simulator environment. YAQQ exploits reachability tradeoffs conceptually derived from quantum algorithmic information theory. Our results demonstrate the pragmatic application of identifying gate sets that are advantageous to popularly used quantum gate sets in representing quantum algorithms. Consequently, we demonstrate pragmatic use cases of YAQQ in comparing transversal logical gate sets in quantum error correction codes, designing optimal quantum instruction sets, and compiling to specific quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum architecture search~(QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS focus on machine learning-based approaches from reinforcement learning, like deep Q-network. While multi-layer perceptron-based deep Q-networks have been applied for QAS, their interpretability remains challenging due to the high number of parameters. In this work, we evaluate the practicality of KANs in quantum architecture search problems, analyzing their efficiency in terms of the probability of success, frequency of optimal solutions and their dependencies on various degrees of freedom of the network. In a noiseless scenario, the probability of success and the number of optimal quantum circuit configurations to generate the multi-qubit maximally entangled states are significantly higher than MLPs. Moreover in noisy scenarios, KAN can achieve a better fidelity in approximating maximally entangled state than MLPs, where the performance of the MLP significantly depends on the choice of activation function. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a very small number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs, however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is much higher.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Fault Tolerance for Fast Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, reliable logical operations are essential for the realization of useful quantum computers, as they are required to implement practical quantum algorithms at large scale. By redundantly encoding logical qubits into many physical qubits and using syndrome measurements to detect and subsequently correct errors, one can achieve very low logical error rates. However, for most practical quantum error correcting (QEC) codes such as the surface code, it is generally believed that due to syndrome extraction errors, multiple extraction rounds -- on the order of the code distance d -- are required for fault-tolerant computation. Here, we show that contrary to this common belief, fault-tolerant logical operations can be performed with constant time overhead for a broad class of QEC codes, including the surface code with magic state inputs and feed-forward operations, to achieve "algorithmic fault tolerance". Through the combination of transversal operations and novel strategies for correlated decoding, despite only having access to partial syndrome information, we prove that the deviation from the ideal measurement result distribution can be made exponentially small in the code distance. We supplement this proof with circuit-level simulations in a range of relevant settings, demonstrating the fault tolerance and competitive performance of our approach. Our work sheds new light on the theory of fault tolerance, potentially reducing the space-time cost of practical fault-tolerant quantum computation by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Efficient classical algorithm for simulating boson sampling with inhomogeneous partial distinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson sampling is one of the leading protocols for demonstrating a quantum advantage, but the theory of how this protocol responds to noise is still incomplete. We extend the theory of classical simulation of boson sampling with partial distinguishability to the case where the degree of indistinguishability between photon pairs is different between different pairs.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger cats coupled with cavities losses: the effect of finite and structured reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the generation of a Schr\"odinger cat in a nanocavity created by the coupling of an electromagnetic mode with an exciton in a quantum dot considering the dispersive limit of the Jaynes-Cummings model. More than the generation itself, we focus on the effects of the environment over the bosonic state in the nanocavity, which has losses simulated by coupling with two different kind of reservoirs. In the first case, the interaction between the system with a finite reservoir shows that fragments of different sizes of the reservoir deliver the same amount of information about the physical system in the dynamics of the birth and death of the Schr\"odinger cat. The second case considers a structured reservoir, whose spectral density varies significantly with frequency. This situation becomes relevant in solid-state devices where quantum channels are embedded, as memory effects generally cannot be neglected. Under these circumstances, it is observed that the dynamics can differ substantially from the Markovian, presenting oscillations related to the average number of photons. These oscillations influence the information flow between the system and the environment, evidenced here by the measurement of non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Unifying methods for optimal control in non-Markovian quantum systems via process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large dimensionality of environments is the limiting factor in applying optimal control to open quantum systems beyond Markovian approximations. Multiple methods exist to simulate non-Markovian open systems which effectively reduce the environment to a number of active degrees of freedom. Here we show that several of these methods can be expressed in terms of a process tensor in the form of a matrix-product-operator, which serves as a unifying framework to show how they can be used in optimal control, and to compare their performance. The matrix-product-operator form provides a general scheme for computing gradients using back propagation, and allows the efficiency of the different methods to be compared via the bond dimensions of their respective process tensors.</description>

      <title>Re-examination of the role of displacement and photon catalysis operation in continuous variable measurement device-independent quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the benefits of using $m$-photon catalysed two-mode squeezed coherent ($m$-PCTMSC) state in continuous variable measurement device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI-QKD). To that end, we derive the Wigner characteristic function of the $m$-PCTMSC state and show that the 0-PCTMSC state is a Gaussian state and is an inferior choice as compared to the zero photon catalyzed two-mode squeezed vacuum state for CV-MDI-QKD. We carry out the optimization of the secret key rate with respect to all state parameters, namely variance, transmissivity, and displacement. Contrary to many recent proposals, the results show that zero- and single-photon catalysis operation provides only a marginal benefit in improving the maximum transmission distance. Secondly, we find that displacement offers no benefit in improving CV-MDI-QKD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid separation of linear crystals of trapped ions into different subsets is critical for realizing trapped ion quantum computing architectures where ions are rearranged in trap arrays to achieve all-to-all connectivity between qubits. We introduce a general theoretical framework that can be used to describe the separation of same-species and mixed-species crystals into smaller subsets. The framework relies on an efficient description of the evolution of Gaussian motional states under quadratic Hamiltonians that only requires a special solution of the classical equations of motion of the ions to describe their quantum evolution under the influence of a time-dependent applied potential and the ions' mutual Coulomb repulsion. We provide time-dependent applied potentials suitable for separation of a mixed species three-ion crystal on timescales similar to that of free expansion driven by Coulomb repulsion, with all modes along the crystal axis starting and ending close to their ground states. Three separately-confined mixed species ions can be combined into a crystal held in a single well without energy gain by time-reversal of this separation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bell nonlocality and entanglement are two kinds of quantum correlations in quantum systems. Due to the recent upgrade in Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) experiment, it is possible to explore the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation with high precision data. We provide a systematic method for studying quantum correlations in spin-1/2 hyperon-antihyperon systems through the measures for the nonlocality and entanglement. We find that with nonvanishing polarizations of the hyperon and its antihyperon, the kinematic region of nonlocality in the hyperon-antihyperon system is more restricted than the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ system in which polarizations of $\tau$ leptons are vanishing. We also present an experimental proposal to probe the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems at BSEIII.</description>

      <title>Stimulated emission of virtual photons: Energy transfer by light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-transfer processes can be viewed as being due to the emission of a virtual photon. It is demonstrated that the emission of virtual photons and thus of energy transfer is stimulated by the sheer presence of photons. We concentrate here on interatomic/intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) where an excited system relaxes by transferring its excess energy to a neighbor ionizing it. ICD is inactive if this excess energy is insufficiently large. However, in the presence of photons, the long-range interaction between the system and its neighbor can utilize the photon field making ICD active. The properties of this stimulated-ICD mechanism are discussed. The concept can be transferred to other scenarios. We discuss collective-ICD where two excited molecules concertedly transfer their excess energy. Also here, the presence of photons can make the process active if the sum of excess energies were insufficient to do so. Examples with typical molecules and atoms are presented to demonstrate that these stimulated processes can play a role.</description>

      <title>A CFT dual for evaporating black holes: boundary continuous matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states, especially Matrix Product States (MPS), are crucial tools for studying how particles in large quantum systems are entangled with each other. MPS are particularly effective for modeling systems in one-dimensional space. Their continuous version, known as continuous Matrix Product States (cMPS), extends this approach to more complex quantum field theories that describe systems with an infinite number of interacting particles. This paper introduces a novel extension, boundary continuous Matrix Product States (BCMPS), which incorporate boundary states from conformal field theory (CFT). We construct BCMPS and explore their potential holographic duals, linking them to black hole microstates with end-of-the-world branes in AdS/CFT. This connection hints at a deeper relationship between tensor networks and spacetime geometry, potentially offering new insights into the interplay between quantum information and gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators: A View from the Corner Charge Fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, within a finite region is a powerful approach to characterizing quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that the corner charge fluctuation reveals universal information even for generic $\textit{lattice}$ systems of non-interacting electrons. We first prove that universal angle-dependence can be recovered in the $\textit{small-angle}$ limit for proper partitions of the lattice, from which the integrated Fubini-Study quantum metric can be extracted. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically. Numerical verification is presented for various Chern insulator models, demonstrating the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, we highlight a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>A solvable embedding mechanism for one-dimensional spinless and Majorana fermions in higher-dimensional spin-1/2 magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We write down a class of two-dimensional quantum spin-1/2 Hamiltonians whose eigenspectra are exactly solvable via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The general structure corresponds to a suitable grid composed of XY or XX-Ising spin chains and ZZ-Ising spin chains and is generalizable to higher dimensions. They can host stacks of one-dimensional spinless fermion liquids with gapless excitations and power-law correlations coexisting with ordered spin moments (localized spinless fermions). Bond-dependent couplings thus can be an alternate mechanism than geometric frustration of SU(2)-symmetric couplings to obtain spinless fermionic excitations. Put in a different way, bond-dependent couplings allow for an embedding of one-dimensional spinless fermion (Tomonoga-Luttinger) liquids and solids and also Majorana excitations in higher dimensions. They can accommodate a simpler set of site-local conserved quantities apart from the more intricate, interlocked set of plaquette-local or bond-local conserved quantities in Kitaev's honeycomb model with Majorana excitations. The proposed grid structure may provide an architecture for quantum engineering with controllable qubits.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable non-unitary time evolution in quantum critical systems I: Effect of complex spacetime metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this series of works, we study exactly solvable non-unitary time evolutions in one-dimensional quantum critical systems ranging from quantum quenches to time-dependent drivings. In this part I, we are motivated by the recent works of Kontsevich and Segal [1] and Witten [2] on allowable complex spacetime metrics in quantum field theories. In general, such complex spacetime metrics will lead to non-unitary time evolutions. In this work, we study the universal features of such non-unitary time evolutions based on exactly solvable setups. Various physical quantities including entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and energy density at an arbitrary time can be exactly solved. Due to the damping effect introduced by the complex time, the excitations in the initial state are gradually damped out in time. The non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits universal features that are qualitatively different from the case of real-time evolutions. For instance, for an infinite system after a global quench, the entanglement entropy of the semi-infinite subsystem will grow logarithmically in time, in contrast to the linear growth in a real-time evolution. Moreover, we study numerically the time-dependent driven quantum critical systems with allowable complex spacetime metrics. It is found that the competition between driving and damping leads to a steady state with an interesting entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>Collective Bit Flipping-Based Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes have been proven to achieve higher minimum distances at higher code rates than surface codes. However, this family of codes imposes stringent latency requirements and poor performance under iterative decoding, especially when the variable degree is low. In this work, we improve both the error correction performance and decoding latency of variable degree-3 (dv-3) QLDPC codes under iterative decoding. Firstly, we perform a detailed analysis of the structure of a well-known family of QLDPC codes, i.e., hypergraph product-based codes. Then, we propose a decoding approach that stems from the knowledge of harmful configurations apparent in these codes. Our decoding scheme is based on applying a modified version of bit flipping (BF) decoding, namely two-bit bit flipping (TBF) decoding, which adds more degrees of freedom to BF decoding. The granularity offered by TBF decoding helps us design sets of decoders that operate in parallel and can collectively decode error patterns appearing in harmful configurations of the code, thus addressing both the latency and performance requirements. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decoding scheme surpasses other iterative decoding approaches for various dv-3 QLDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Small Circle Expansion for Adjoint QCD$_2$ with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $1+1$-dimensional $\text{SU}(N)$ gauge theory coupled to one adjoint multiplet of Majorana fermions on a small spatial circle of circumference $L$. Using periodic boundary conditions, we derive the effective action for the quantum mechanics of the holonomy and the fermion zero modes in perturbation theory up to order $(gL)^3$. When the adjoint fermion mass-squared is tuned to $g^2 N/(2\pi)$, the effective action is found to be an example of supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a nontrivial superpotential. We separate the states into the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ center symmetry sectors (universes) labeled by $p=0, \ldots, N-1$ and show that in one of the sectors the supersymmetry is unbroken, while in the others it is broken spontaneously. These results give us new insights into the $(1,1)$ supersymmetry of adjoint QCD$_2$, which has previously been established using light-cone quantization. When the adjoint mass is set to zero, our effective Hamiltonian does not depend on the fermions at all, so that there are $2^{N-1}$ degenerate sectors of the Hilbert space. This construction appears to provide an explicit realization of the extended symmetry of the massless model, where there are $2^{2N-2}$ operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. We also generalize our results to other gauge groups $G$, for which supersymmetry is found at the adjoint mass-squared $g^2 h^\vee/(2\pi)$, where $h^\vee$ is the dual Coxeter number of $G$.</description>

      <title>Absorption Spectroscopy of $^{40}$Ca Atomic Beams Produced via Pulsed Laser Ablation: A Quantitative Comparison of Ca and CaTiO$_3$ Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsed laser ablation is an increasingly prevalent method for fast ion trap loading of various species, however characteristics of the ablation target source material can affect the ion-loading process. One factor which can reduce the atomic flux from a target is oxidation during atmospheric exposure when preparing or making changes to the ion trap vacuum system. Recent work has shown that perovskite ablation targets produce consistent atomic densities even after exposure to atmosphere when compared to elemental source targets. In this work, we directly compare calcium (Ca) and calcium-titanate (CaTiO$_3$) ablation targets, characterizing the neutral atomic beam flux using resonant, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy of the 423 nm $^{1}S_0 \rightarrow$ $^{1}P_1$ transition in neutral Ca. We measure the ablation plume longitudinal and transverse temperatures, number density, ion production, and spot lifetime for each target. In addition, we compare the ablated atomic beam density for both targets before and after 21 hours of exposure to atmosphere, demonstrating the relative robustness of the CaTiO$_3$ source.</description>

      <title>Iso-BAE Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed as the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The rest of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <title>Correlators of Worldline Proper Length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical observer can measure elapsed proper time along their worldline. When observers are coupled to a system with internal correlations, measurements of elapsed time may inherit these correlations. We show that derivatives of the on-shell action with respect to worldline mass compute correlation functions of worldline proper length at tree level. We study worldlines coupled to a scalar field. We calculate the length-length two-point function and find it arises from correlated path fluctuations. As an application, we propose that the logarithm of local correlators serves as a generating function of length correlators, which generalizes the on-shell action prescription. Using this proposal, we extract AdS worldline observables from local CFT correlators as computed by Witten diagrams. We briefly discuss extensions to gravity, interferometers, and the holographic encoding of observer time.</description>

      <title>Environment-Mediated Long-Ranged Correlations in Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum states in complex aggregates are unavoidably affected by environmental effects, which typically cannot be accurately modeled by simple Markovian processes. As system sizes scale up, nonperturbative simulation become thus unavoidable but they are extremely challenging due to the intimate interplay of intrinsic many-body interaction and time-retarded feedback from environmental degrees of freedom. In this work, we utilize the recently developed Quantum Dissipation with Minimally Extended State Space (QD-MESS) approach to address reservoir induced long-ranged temporal correlations in finite size Ising-type spin chains. For thermal reservoirs with ohmic and subohmic spectral density we simulate the quantum time evolution from finite to zero temperature. The competition between thermal fluctuations, quantum fluctuations, and anti-/ferromagnetic interactions reveal a rich pattern of dynamical phases including dissipative induced phase transitions and spatiotemporal correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation of Hawking radiations for mass-superposed BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies using the Unruh-DeWitt detector model have revealed the quantum signatures of black hole mass superposition. In this paper, we use the equal-time density-density correlation function to reinvestigate the mass superposition of BTZ black holes. Interestingly, the quantum signatures of BTZ black hole mass superposition can be revealed by the equal-time density-density correlation peaks. Additionally, different mass superpositions for the same mass ratio can be distinguished, a phenomenon not previously documented. Specifically, the correlation function method can pinpoint the location where Hawking radiations are generated, even for mass-superposed BTZ black holes. Our findings indicate that this location is approximately at two and a half times the radius of the horizon, where the correlation function reaches its maximum.This supports the concept of a quantum atmosphere as the origin locus of Hawking radiation,even in quantum-superposed spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations using an annealing-based approach is based on solving generalized eigenvalue problems. When a partial differential equation is discretized, it leads to a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be expressed as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be converted into an optimization problem with the objective function being a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm allows the computation of eigenvectors at arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables using an Ising machine. Simple examples solved using this method and theoretical analysis provide a guideline for appropriate parameter settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of linearized quantum gravity, we study the quantum gravitational interaction between two nonpointlike objects induced by fluctuating gravitomagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that, in addition to the quantum gravitational interaction induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric fields previously studied, there exists a quantum gravitomagnetic interaction. This interaction originates from the interaction between the instantaneous localized mass currents in nonpointlike objects induced by the fluctuating gravitomagnetic fields. Using fourth-order perturbation theory, we derive the explicit form of the quantum gravitomagnetic interaction energy, which shows an $r^{-10}$ dependence in the near regime and an $r^{-11}$ dependence in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the two objects. This interaction energy is expected to be significant when the gravitomagnetic polarizability of the objects is large.</description>

      <title>Percolation renormalization group analysis of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical study of confinement in lattice gauge theories (LGTs) remains a difficult task to this day. Taking a geometric perspective on confinement, we develop a real-space renormalization group (RG) formalism for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs using percolation probability as a confinement order parameter. The RG flow we analyze is constituted by both the percolation probability and the coupling parameters. We consider a classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in two dimensions, with matter and thermal fluctuations, and analytically derive the confinement phase diagram. We find good agreement with numerical and exact benchmark results and confirm that a finite matter density enforces confinement at $T&lt;\infty$ in the model we consider. Our RG scheme enables future analytical studies of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs with matter and quantum fluctuations and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control over quantum systems is typically achieved by time-dependent electric or magnetic fields. Alternatively, electronic spins can be controlled by spin-polarized currents. Here we demonstrate coherent driving of a single spin by a radiofrequency spin-polarized current injected from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope into an organic molecule. With the excitation of electron paramagnetic resonance, we established dynamic control of single spins by spin torque using a local electric current. In addition our work highlights the dissipative action of the spin-transfer torque, in contrast to the nondissipative action of the magnetic field, which allows for the manipulation of individual spins based on controlled decoherence.</description>

      <title>Accelerated creation of NOON states with ultracold atoms via counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17545v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum control protocol is proposed for the creation of NOON states with N ultracold bosonic atoms on two modes, corresponding to the coherent superposition $\vert N,0\rangle + \vert 0,N\rangle$. This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the two other modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical usefulness, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition.</description>

      <title>Does locality plus perfect correlation imply determinism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 1964 paper by John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. There is an ongoing and vigorous debate on whether he relied on an assumption of determinism, or instead, as he later claimed, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is shown that the weak form of locality used in Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for such a derivation, whereas an independent form called outcome independence is sufficient even when weak locality does not hold. It further follows that outcome independence, by itself, implies that standard quantum mechanics is incomplete. It is also shown that an appeal by Bell to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky argument to support his claim fails, via examples that expose logical gaps in this argument. However, replacing the reality criterion underpinning the argument by a stronger criterion enables a rigorous derivation of both weak locality and determinism, as required for Bell's 1964 paper. Consequences for quantum interpretations, locality, and classical common causes are briefly discussed, with reference to an example of local classical indeterminism.</description>

Abstract: Single photons constitute a main platform in quantum science and technology: they carry quantum information over extended distances in the future quantum internet and can be manipulated in advanced photonic circuits enabling scalable photonic quantum computing. The main challenge in quantum photonics is how to generate advanced entangled resource states and efficient light-matter interfaces. Here we utilize the efficient and coherent coupling of a single quantum emitter to a nanophotonic waveguide for realizing quantum nonlinear interaction between single-photon wavepackets. This inherently multimode quantum system constitutes a new research frontier in quantum optics. We demonstrate control of a photon with another photon and experimentally unravel the dynamical response of two-photon interactions mediated by a quantum emitter, and show that the induced quantum correlations are controlled by the pulse duration. The work will open new avenues for tailoring complex photonic quantum resource states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using near-term quantum computers to achieve a quantum advantage requires efficient strategies to improve the performance of the noisy quantum devices presently available. We develop and experimentally validate two efficient error mitigation protocols named "Noiseless Output Extrapolation" and "Pauli Error Cancellation" that can drastically enhance the performance of quantum circuits composed of noisy cycles of gates. By combining popular mitigation strategies such as probabilistic error cancellation and noise amplification with efficient noise reconstruction methods, our protocols can mitigate a wide range of noise processes that do not satisfy the assumptions underlying existing mitigation protocols, including non-local and gate-dependent processes. We test our protocols on a four-qubit superconducting processor at the Advanced Quantum Testbed. We observe significant improvements in the performance of both structured and random circuits, with up to $86\%$ improvement in variation distance over the unmitigated outputs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocols, as well as their practicality for current hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Decoding general error correcting codes and the role of complementarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Stean (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to that for a general QECC. In the extension, instead of the classical decoders of the linear classical codes that define the CSS code, we use decoding measurements of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded.The decoding error depends on the errors of the two decoding measurements and the degree of complementarity of the CQ codes.We then demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, in which we improve decoding errors over previous approaches and further show that the black hole dynamics may be an optimal encoder for quantum information but a poor encoder for classical information.</description>

Abstract: Quantum coherence is a crucial prerequisite for quantum technologies. Therefore, the robust generation, as autonomous as possible, of quantum coherence remains the essential problem for developing this field. We consider a method of synthesizing and multiplexing quantum coherence from spin systems without any direct drives only coupled to bosonic baths. The previous studies in this field have demonstrated that a back-action of the bath to the spin subsystem is important to generate it, however, it simultaneously gives significant limits to the generated coherence. We propose a viable approach with the bosonic bath that allows overcoming these limits by avoiding the destructive effect of the back-action processes. Using this approach, we suggest an advanced synthesis of the quantum coherence non-perturbatively in the spin-boson coupling parameters of multiple bosonic baths to increase and multiplex it for upcoming proof-of-principle experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of multistate Landau-Zener model which cannot be solved by integrability conditions or other standard techniques. By analyzing analytical constraints on its scattering matrix and performing fitting to results from numerical simulations of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we find nearly exact analytical expressions of all its transition probabilities for specific parameter choices. We also determine the transition probabilities up to leading orders of series expansions in terms of the inverse sweep rate (namely, in the diabatic limit) for general parameter choices. We further show that this model can describe a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with couplings changing linearly in time. Our work presents a new route, i.e., analytical constraint plus fitting, to analyze those multistate Landau-Zener models which are beyond the applicability of conventional solving methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14106v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression of a Wigner function that approximately describes the time evolution of the one-dimensional motion of a particle in a nonharmonic potential. Our method involves two exact frame transformations, accounting for both the classical dynamics of the centroid of the initial state and the rotation and squeezing about that trajectory. Subsequently, we employ two crucial approximations, namely the constant-angle and linearized-decoherence approximations. These approximations are effective in the regime of wide potentials and small fluctuations, namely potentials that enable spatial expansions orders of magnitude larger than the one of the initial state but that remain smaller compared to the relevant dynamical length scale (e.g., distance between turning points). Our analytical result elucidates the interplay between classical and quantum physics and the impact of decoherence during nonlinear dynamics. This analytical result is instrumental to design, optimize and understand proposals using nonlinear dynamics to generate macroscopic quantum states of massive particles.</description>

Abstract: Three major misconceptions concerning quantized tachyon fields: the energy spectrum unbounded from below, the frame-dependent and unstable vacuum state, and the non-covariant commutation rules, are shown to be a result of misrepresenting the Lorentz group in a too small Hilbert space. By doubling this space we establish an explicitly covariant framework that allows for the proper quantization of the tachyon fields eliminating all of these issues. Our scheme that is derived to maintain the relativistic covariance also singles out the two-state formalism developed by Aharonov et al. [1] as a preferred interpretation of the quantum theory.</description>

Abstract: Metasurface enables the generation and manipulation of multiphoton entanglement with flat optics, providing a more efficient platform for large-scale photonic quantum information processing. Here, we show that a single metasurface optical device would allow more efficient characterizations of multiphoton entangled states, such as shadow tomography, which generally requires fast and complicated control of optical setups to perform information-complete measurements, a demanding task using conventional optics. The compact and stable device here allows implementations of general positive observable value measures with a reduced sample complexity and significantly alleviates the experimental complexity to implement shadow tomography. Integrating self-learning and calibration algorithms, we observe notable advantages in the reconstruction of multiphoton entanglement, including using fewer measurements, having higher accuracy, and being robust against experimental imperfections. Our work unveils the feasibility of metasurface as a favorable integrated optical device for efficient characterization of multiphoton entanglement, and sheds light on scalable photonic quantum technologies with ultra-thin optical devices.</description>

Yet, their quantification, rather than mere detection, generally requires reconstructing the spectrum of quantum states, i.e., experimentally challenging measurement sets that increase exponentially with the system size. Here, we demonstrate quantitative bounds to operationally useful entanglement and coherence that are universally valid, analytically computable, and experimentally friendly. Specifically, our main theoretical results are lower and upper bounds to the coherent information and the relative entropy of coherence in terms of local and global purities of quantum states. To validate our proposal, we experimentally implement two purity detection methods in an optical system: shadow estimation with random measurements and collective measurements on pairs of state copies. The experiment shows that both the coherent information and the relative entropy of coherence of pure and mixed unknown quantum states can be bounded by purity functions. Our research offers an efficient means of verifying large-scale quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: A variational quantum algorithm for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on a quantum computer was proposed by Lubasch et al. In this paper, we generalize the method introduced by Lubasch et al. to cover a broader class of nonlinear PDEs as well as multidimensional PDEs, and study the performance of the variational quantum algorithm on several example equations. Specifically, we show via numerical simulations that the algorithm can solve instances of the Single-Asset Black-Scholes equation with a nontrivial nonlinear volatility model, the Double-Asset Black-Scholes equation, the Buckmaster equation, and the deterministic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. Our simulations used up to $n=12$ ansatz qubits, computing PDE solutions with $2^n$ grid points. We also performed proof-of-concept experiments with a trapped-ion quantum processor from IonQ, showing accurate computation of two representative expectation values needed for the calculation of a single timestep of the nonlinear Black--Scholes equation. Through our classical simulations and experiments on quantum hardware, we have identified -- and we discuss -- several open challenges for using quantum variational methods to solve PDEs in a regime with a large number ($\gg 2^{20}$) of grid points, but also a practical number of gates per circuit and circuit shots.</description>

      <title>Experimental distillation of tripartite quantum steering with an optimal local filtering operation</title>

Abstract: Multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen~(EPR) steering admits multipartite entanglement in the presence of uncharacterized verifiers, enabling practical applications in semi-device-independent protocols. Such applications generally require stronger steerability, while the unavoidable noise weakens steerability and consequently degrades the performance of quantum information processing. Here, we propose the local filtering operation that can maximally distill genuine tripartite EPR steering from $N$ copies of three-qubit generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, in the context of two semi-device-independent scenarios. The optimal filtering operation is determined by the maximization of assemblage fidelity. Analytical and numerical results indicate the advantage of proposed filtering operation when $N$ is finite and the steerability of initial assemblages is weak. Experimentally, a proof-of-principle demonstration of two-copy distillation is realized with optical system. The advantage of optimal local filtering operation is confirmed by the distilled assemblage in terms of higher assemblage fidelity with perfectly genuine tripartite steerable assemblages, as well as the greater violation of the inequality to witness genuine tripartite steerable assemblages. Our results benefit the distillation of multipartite EPR steering in practice, where the number of copies of initial assemblages is generally finite.</description>

Abstract: Noise is in general inevitable and detrimental to practical and useful quantum communication and computation. Under the resource theory framework, resource distillation serves as a generic tool to overcome the effect of noise. Yet, conventional resource distillation protocols generally require operations on multi-copies of resource states, and strong limitations exist that restrict their practical utilities. Recently, by relaxing the setting of resource distillation to only approximating the measurement statistics instead of the quantum state, a resource-frugal protocol, virtual resource distillation, is proposed, which allows more effective distillation of noisy resources. Here, we report its experimental implementation on a photonic quantum system for the distillation of quantum coherence (up to dimension 4) and bipartite entanglement. We show the virtual distillation of the maximal superposed state of dimension four from the state of dimension two, an impossible task in conventional coherence distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the virtual distillation of entanglement with operations acting only on a single copy of the noisy EPR pair and showcase the quantum teleportation task using the virtually distilled EPR pair with a significantly improved fidelity of the teleported state. These results illustrate the feasibility of the virtual resource distillation method and pave the way for accurate manipulation of quantum resources with noisy quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Filtering Product States</title>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm to efficiently prepare states with a small energy variance at the target energy. We achieve it by filtering a product state at the given energy with a Lorentzian filter of width $\delta$. Given a local Hamiltonian on $N$ qubits, we construct a parent Hamiltonian whose ground state corresponds to the filtered product state with variable energy variance proportional to $\delta\sqrt{N}$. We prove that the parent Hamiltonian is gapped and its ground state can be efficiently implemented in $\mathrm{poly}(N,1/\delta)$ time via adiabatic evolution. We numerically benchmark the algorithm for a particular non-integrable model and find that the adiabatic evolution time to prepare the filtered state with a width $\delta$ is independent of the system size $N$. Furthermore, the adiabatic evolution can be implemented with circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(N^2\delta^{-4})$. Our algorithm provides a way to study the finite energy regime of many body systems in quantum simulators by directly preparing a finite energy state, providing access to an approximation of the microcanonical properties at an arbitrary energy.</description>

      <title>The impact of different unravelings in a monitored system of free fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a free-fermion chain undergoing dephasing, described by two different random-measurement protocols (unravelings): a quantum-state-diffusion and a quantum-jump one. Both protocols keep the state in a Slater-determinant form, allowing to address quite large system sizes. We find a bifurcation in the distribution of the measurement operators along the quantum trajectories, that's to say, there is a point where the shape of this distribution changes from unimodal to bimodal. The value of the measurement strength where this phenomenon occurs is similar for the two unravelings, but the distributions and the transition have different properties reflecting the symmetries of the two measurement protocols. We also consider the scaling with the system size of the inverse participation ratio of the Slater-determinant components and find a power-law scaling that marks a multifractal behaviour, in both unravelings and for any nonvanishing measurement strength.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Spherical Bloch Hyper-spheres from Quantum Matrix Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploiting analogies between the precessing quantum spin system and the charge-monopole system, we construct Bloch hyper-spheres with $\it{exact}$ spherical symmetries in arbitrary dimensions. Such Bloch hyper-spheres are realized as a collection of the orbits of a precessing quantum spin. The geometry of Bloch hyper-spheres is exactly equal to the quantum Nambu geometry of higher dimensional fuzzy spheres. The stabilizer group symmetry of the Bloch hyper-sphere necessarily introduces degenerate spin-coherent states, giving rise to the Wilczek-Zee geometric phase of non-Abelian monopoles associated with the hyper-sphere holonomy. The degenerate spin-coherent states induce matrix-valued quantum geometric tensors. While the minimal spin Bloch hyper-spheres exhibit similar properties in even and odd dimensions, their large spin counterparts differ qualitatively depending on the parity of the dimensions. Exact correspondences between spin-coherent states and monopole harmonics in higher dimensions are established. We also investigate density matrices described by Bloch hyper-balls and elucidate their corresponding statistical and geometric properties, such as von Neumann entropies and Bures quantum metrics.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning (ML) is an emerging field, amalgamating the strengths of both classical neural networks and quantum variational circuits on the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. This paper performs an extensive comparative analysis between different hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms, namely Quantum Convolution Neural Network, Quanvolutional Neural Network and Quantum ResNet, for image classification. The experiments designed in this paper focus on different Quantum ML (QML) algorithms to better understand the accuracy variation across the different quantum architectures by implementing interchangeable quantum circuit layers, varying the repetition of such layers and their efficient placement. Such variations enable us to compare the accuracy across different architectural permutations of a given hybrid QML algorithm. The performance comparison of the hybrid models, based on the accuracy, provides us with an understanding of hybrid quantum-classical convergence in correlation with the quantum layer count and the qubit count variations in the circuit.</description>

      <title>Studying the Impact of Quantum-Specific Hyperparameters on Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQNNs) represent a promising solution that combines the strengths of classical machine learning with quantum computing capabilities. Compared to classical deep neural networks (DNNs), HQNNs present an additional set of hyperparameters, which are specific to quantum circuits. These quantum-specific hyperparameters, such as quantum circuit depth, number of qubits, type of entanglement, number of shots, and measurement observables, can significantly impact the behavior of the HQNNs and their capabilities to learn the given task. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these variations on different HQNN models for image classification tasks, implemented on the PennyLane framework. We aim to uncover intuitive and counter-intuitive learning patterns of HQNN models within granular levels of controlled quantum perturbations, to form a sound basis for their correlation to accuracy and training time. The outcome of our study opens new avenues for designing efficient HQNN algorithms and builds a foundational base for comprehending and identifying tunable hyperparameters of HQNN models that can lead to useful design implementation and usage.</description>

Abstract: The reduction and distortion of quantum correlations in the presence of classical noise leads to varied levels of inefficiency in the availability of entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing protocols. While generically minimizing required entanglement for mixed quantum states remains challenging, a class of many-body Gaussian quantum states ($\mathcal{N}$IC) is here identified that exhibits two-mode bipartite entanglement structure, resembling that of pure states, for which the logarithmic negativity entanglement measure remains invariant upon inclusion of the classical correlations and optimal entanglement resources can be clearly quantified. This subclass is found to be embedded within a broader class of many-body Gaussian states ($\mathcal{N}$-SOL) that retain two-mode entanglement structure for detection processes. These two entanglement classes are relevant in theoretical and experimental applications from the scalar field vacuum to the local axial motional modes of trapped ion chains. Utilizing the subspace that heralds inseparability in response to partial transposition, a minimum noise filtering process is designed to be necessary, sufficient, and computable for determining membership in these classes of entanglement structure. Application of this process to spacelike regions of the free scalar field vacuum is found to improve resource upper bounds, providing new understanding of the entanglement required for the quantum simulation of quantum fields as observed by arrays of local detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of dissipative quantum systems, particularly beyond the weak coupling approximation, is central to various quantum applications. While numerically exact methods provide accurate solutions, they often lack the analytical insight provided by theoretical approaches. In this study, we employ the recently-developed method dubbed the effective Hamiltonian theory to understand the dynamics of system-bath configurations without resorting to a perturbative description of the system-bath coupling energy. Through a combination of mapping steps and truncation, the effective Hamiltonian theory offers both analytical insights into signatures of strong couplings in open quantum systems and a straightforward path for numerical simulations. To validate the accuracy of the method, we apply it to two canonical models: a single spin immersed in a bosonic bath and two noninteracting spins in a common bath. In both cases, we study the transient regime and the steady state limit at nonzero temperature, and spanning system-bath interactions from the weak to the strong regime. By comparing the results of the effective Hamiltonian theory with numerically exact simulations, we show that although the former overlooks non-Markovian features in the transient equilibration dynamics, it correctly captures non-perturbative bath-generated couplings between otherwise non-interacting spins as observed in their synchronization dynamics and correlations. Altogether, the effective Hamiltonian theory offers a powerful approach to understanding strong coupling dynamics and thermodynamics, capturing the signatures of such interactions in both relaxation dynamics and in the steady state limit.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks are referred to as quantum analogs to random walks in mathematics. They have been studied as quantum algorithms in quantum information for quantum computers. There are two types of quantum walks. One is the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in long time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuits for Non-Unitary and Unitary Diagonal Operators with Space-Time-Accuracy trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum computers (quantum state preparation) and many others. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, i.e., the number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with respect either to the width, i.e, the number of ancilla qubits, or to the accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, i.e., the total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level. This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of the diffusion equation. This simulation paves the way to efficient implementations of stochastic models useful in physics, chemistry, biology, image processing and finance.</description>

Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has been proposed as a method to implement quantum logic gates with robustness comparable to that of adiabatic holonomic gates but with shorter execution times. In this paper, we establish an isoholonomic inequality for quantum gates, which provides a lower bound on the lengths of cyclic transformations of the computational space that generate a specific gate. Then, as a corollary, we derive a nonadiabatic execution time estimate for holonomic gates. In addition, we demonstrate that under certain dimensional conditions, the isoholonomic inequality is tight in the sense that every gate on the computational space can be implemented holonomically and unitarily in a time-optimal way. We illustrate the results by showing that the procedures for implementing a universal set of holonomic gates proposed in a pioneering paper on nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation saturate the isoholonomic inequality and are thus time optimal.</description>

Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) is at the heart of fault-tolerant quantum computing. As the size of quantum platforms is expected to grow, one of the open questions is to design new optimal codes of ever-increasing size. A related challenge is to ``certify'' the quality of a given code by evaluating its minimum distance, a quantity characterizing code's capacity to preserve quantum information. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Here we propose to harness the power of contemporary quantum platforms to address this question, and in this way help design quantum platforms of the future. Namely, we introduce an approach to compute the minimum distance of quantum stabilizer codes by reformulating the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and leveraging established QUBO algorithms and heuristics as well as quantum annealing (QA) to address the latter. The reformulation as a QUBO introduces only a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in the required number of variables. We demonstrate practical viability of our method by comparing the performance of purely classical algorithms with the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer as well as hybrid quantum-classical algorithm Qbsolv. We found that the hybrid approach demonstrates competitive performance, on par with the best available classical algorithms to solve QUBO. In a practical sense, the QUBO-based approach is currently lagging behind the best deterministic minimal distance algorithms, however this advantage may disappear as the size of the platforms grows.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer on Cayley graphs over a non-abelian group of order $8n$</title>

Abstract: The \textit{transition matrix} of a graph $\Gamma$ with adjacency matrix $A$ is defined by $H(\tau ) := \exp(-\mathbf{i}\tau A)$, where $\tau \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbf{i} = \sqrt{-1}$. The graph $\Gamma$ exhibits \textit{perfect state transfer} (PST) between the vertices $u$ and $v$ if there exists $\tau_0(&gt;0)\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\lvert H(\tau_0)_{uv} \rvert = 1$. For a positive integer $n$, the group $V_{8n}$ is defined as $V_{8n} := \langle a,b \colon a^{2n} = b^{4} = 1, ba = a^{-1}b^{-1}, b^{-1}a = a^{-1}b \rangle$. In this paper, we study the existence of perfect state transfer on Cayley graphs $\text{Cay}(V_{8n}, S)$. We present some necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of perfect state transfer on $\text{Cay}(V_{8n}, S)$.</description>

      <title>Dirac Brackets $\leftrightarrow$ Lindblad Equation: A Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time evolution of an open quantum system is governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindlad equation for the reduced density operator of the system. This operator is obtained from the full density operator of the composite system involving the system itself, the bath, and the interactions between them, by performing a partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The entanglement between the system and the bath leads to a generalized Liouville evolution that involves, amongst other things, dissipation and decoherence of the system.
  In a similar fashion, the time evolution of a physical observable in a classically constrained dynamical system is governed by a generalization of the Liouville equation, in which the usual Poisson bracket is replaced by the so-called Dirac bracket. The generalization takes into account the reduction in the phase space of the system because of constraints, which arise either because they are introduced by hand, or because of some underlying gauge invariance.
  We derive an intriguing, but precise classical-quantum correspondence between the aforementioned situations which connects the Lindblad operators to the constraints. The correspondence is illustrated in a system of coupled simple harmonic oscillators studied earlier in the context of the area law of black holes by Bombelli, Koul, Lee, and Sorkin, and independently by Srednicki.</description>

      <title>Variational simulation of $d$-level systems on qubit-based quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current quantum simulators are primarily qubit-based, making them naturally suitable for simulating 2-level quantum systems. However, many systems in nature are inherently $d$-level, including higher spins, bosons, vibrational modes, and itinerant electrons. To simulate $d$-level systems on qubit-based quantum simulators, an encoding method is required to map the $d$-level system onto a qubit basis. Such mapping may introduce illegitimate states in the Hilbert space which makes the simulation more sophisticated. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to address the illegitimate states. In addition, we compare two different mappings, namely binary and symmetry encoding methods, and compare their performance through variational simulation of the ground state and time evolution of various many-body systems. While binary encoding is very efficient with respect to the number of qubits it cannot easily incorporate the symmetries of the original Hamiltonian in its circuit design. On the other hand, the symmetry encoding facilitates the implementation of symmetries in the circuit design, though it comes with an overhead for the number of qubits. Our analysis shows that the symmetry encoding significantly outperforms the binary encoding, despite requiring extra qubits. Their advantage is indicated by requiring fewer two-qubit gates, converging faster, and being far more resilient to Barren plateaus. We have performed variational ground state simulations of spin-1, spin-3/2, and bosonic systems as well as variational time evolution of spin-1 systems. Our proposal can be implemented on existing quantum simulators and its potential is extendable to a broad class of physical models.</description>

      <title>Communication Complexity of Graph Isomorphism, Coloring, and Distance Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum information, nonlocal games are particularly useful for differentiating classical, quantum, and non-signalling correlations. An example of differentiation is given by the principle of no-collapse of communication complexity, which is often interpreted as necessary for a feasible physical theory. It is satisfied by quantum correlations but violated by some non-signalling ones.
  In this work, we investigate this principle in the context of three nonlocal games related to graph theory, starting from the well-known graph isomorphism and graph coloring games, and introducing a new game, the vertex distance game, with a parameter $D\in\mathbb N$, that generalizes the former two to some extent. For these three games, we prove that perfect non-signalling strategies collapse communication complexity under favorable conditions. We also define a refinement of fractional isomorphism of graphs, namely D-fractional isomorphisms, and we show that this characterizes perfect non-signalling strategies for the vertex distance game. Surprisingly, we observe that non-signalling strategies provide a finer distinction for the new game compared to classical and quantum strategies since the parameter D is visible only in the non-signalling setting.</description>

      <title>Cooperative decay of an ensemble of atoms in a one-dimensional chain with a single excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new expression of the cooperative decay rate of a one-dimensional chain of N two-level atoms in the single-excitation configuration. From it, the interference nature of superradiance and subradiance arises naturally, without the need of solving the eigenvalue problem of the atom-atom interaction Green function. The cooperative decay rate can be interpreted as the imaginary part of the expectation value of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian of the system, evaluated over a generalized Dicke state of N atoms in the single-excitation manifold. Whereas the subradiant decay rate is zero for an infinite chain, it decreases as 1/N for a finite chain. A simple approximated expression for the cooperative decay rate is obtained as a function of the lattice constant d and the atomic number N. The results are obtained first for the scalar model and then extended to the vectorial light model, assuming all the dipoles aligned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient numerical methods are still lacking to probe the unconventional dynamics of quantum many-body systems under non-unitary evolution. In this work, we use Faber polynomials to numerically simulate both the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems and the quantum jumps unravelling of the Lindblad dynamics. We apply the method to the non-interacting and interacting Hatano-Nelson models evolving from two different setups: i) a N\'eel state, and ii) a domain wall. In the first case, we study how interactions preserve the initial magnetic order against the skin effect. In the second example, we present numerical evidence of the existence of an effective hydrodynamic description for the domain-wall melting problem in the non-interacting limit. Additionally, we investigate both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the quantum jump unravelling in two quantum spin chains, which exhibit either the non-Hermitian or the Liouvillian skin effect. This numerical method inherently generalises the well-established method based on Chebyshev polynomials to accommodate non-Hermitian scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The giant electro- and elasto-caloric effects in spin chain materials are predicted. The theory is based on the exact quantum mechanical solution of the problem. It is shown that the giant jumps in the entropy and the temperature caused by the caloric effect are weakly affected by the initial temperature. The effect can be used for the cooling of new quantum devices (like systems of qubits in quantum computers). On the other hand, since large changes are predicted in the narrow neighborhood of the critical point, the predicted effect can be used in ultra-sensitive electric and stress sensors for modern microelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.02626v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The many-body physics at quantum phase transitions shows a subtle interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations, emerging in the low-temperature limit. In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws. We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system. In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum transitions.</description>

Abstract: By applying a hydrodynamic representation of non-relativistic scalar electrodynamics to the superconducting order parameter, we predict a negative (attractive) pressure between planar superconducting bodies. For conventional superconductors with London penetration depth $\lambda_\text{L} \approx 100 \text{ nm}$, the pressure reaches tens of $\text{N/mm}^2$ at angstrom separations. The resulting surface energies are in better agreement with experimental values than those predicted by the Hartree-Fock theory, and the emergent electric-field screening length is comparable to that of the Thomas-Fermi theory. The model circumvents the bulk limitations of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer and Ginzburg-Landau theories to the analysis of superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we study the non-Hermitian system under dissipation and give the effective 2*2 Hamiltonian in the k-space by reducing the N*N Hamiltonian in the real space for them. It is discovered that the energy band shows an imaginary line gap. To describe these phenomena, we propose the theory of "non-Hermitian tearing", in which the tearability we define reveals a continuous phase transition at the exceptional point. The non-Hermitian tearing manifests in two forms -- separation of bulk state and decoupling of boundary state. In addition, we also explore the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Qi-Wu-Zhang model under dissipation using the theory of non-Hermitian tearing. Our results provide a theoretical approach for exploring the controlling of non-Hermitian physics on topological quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional hybrid quantum circuits perturbed by quenched quasiperiodic (QP) modulations across the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). Considering non-Pisot QP structures, characterized by unbounded fluctuations, allows us to tune the wandering exponent $\beta$ to exceed the Luck bound $\nu \ge 1/(1-\beta)$ for the stability of the MIPT, where $\nu=1.28(2)$. Via robust numerical simulations of random Clifford circuits interleaved with local projective measurements, we find that sufficiently large QP structural fluctuations destabilize the MIPT and induce a flow to a broad family of critical dynamical phase transitions of the infinite QP type that is governed by the wandering exponent, $\beta$. We numerically determine the associated critical properties, including the correlation length exponent consistent with saturating the Luck bound, and a universal activated dynamical scaling with activation exponent $\psi \cong \beta$, finding excellent agreement with the conclusions of real space renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mechanism to induce superconductivity in atomically thin semiconductors where excitons mediate an effective attraction between electrons. Our model includes interaction effects beyond the paradigm of phonon-mediated superconductivity and connects to the well-established limits of Bose and Fermi polarons. By accounting for the strong-coupling physics of trions, we find that the effective electron-exciton interaction develops a strong frequency and momentum dependence accompanied by the system undergoing an emerging BCS-BEC crossover from weakly bound $s$-wave Cooper pairs to a superfluid of bipolarons. Even at strong-coupling the bipolarons remain relatively light, resulting in critical temperatures of up to 10\% of the Fermi temperature. This renders heterostructures of two-dimensional materials a promising candidate to realize superconductivity at high critical temperatures set by electron doping and trion binding energies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, photon bunching from LED light was observed for the first time using SiPMs. The bunching signature was observed with a significance of $7.3~\sigma$ using 97~hs of data. The light was spectrally filtered using a 1~nm bandpass filter and an Etalon filter to ensure temporal coherence of the field and its coherence time was measured to be $\tau_C = (19 \pm 2)$~ps. The impact of SiPM non-idealities in these kinds of measurements is explored, and we describe the methodology to process SiPM analog waveforms and the event selection used to mitigate these non-idealities.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Robust Parameter Optimization of the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework has been instrumental in advancing near-term quantum algorithms. However, parameter optimization remains a significant bottleneck for VQE, requiring a large number of measurements for successful algorithm execution. In this paper, we propose sequential optimization with approximate parabola (SOAP) as an efficient and robust optimizer specifically designed for parameter optimization of the unitary coupled-cluster ansatz on quantum computers. SOAP leverages sequential optimization and approximates the energy landscape as quadratic functions, minimizing the number of energy evaluations required to optimize each parameter. To capture parameter correlations, SOAP incorporates the average direction from the previous iteration into the optimization direction set. Numerical benchmark studies on molecular systems demonstrate that SOAP achieves significantly faster convergence and greater robustness to noise compared to traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, numerical simulations up to 20 qubits reveal that SOAP scales well with the number of parameters in the ansatz. The exceptional performance of SOAP is further validated through experiments on a superconducting quantum computer using a 2-qubit model system.</description>

Abstract: Due to M\"{u}ller's theorem, the Kolmogorov complexity of a string was shown to be equal to its quantum Kolmogorov complexity. Thus there are no benefits to using quantum mechanics to compress classical information. The quantitative amount of information in classical sources is invariant to the physical model used. These consequences make this theorem arguably the most important result in the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics. The original proof is quite extensive. This paper contains two simple proofs of this theorem. This paper also contains new bounds for quantum Kolmogorov complexity with error.</description>

Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>Learning parameter dependence for Fourier-based option pricing with tensor trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00701</link>

Abstract: A long-standing issue in mathematical finance is the speed-up of pricing options, especially multi-asset options. A recent study has proposed to use tensor train learning algorithms to speed up Fourier transform (FT)-based option pricing, utilizing the ability of tensor networks to compress high-dimensional tensors. Another usage of the tensor network is to compress functions, including their parameter dependence. In this study, we propose a pricing method, where, by a tensor learning algorithm, we build tensor trains that approximate functions appearing in FT-based option pricing with their parameter dependence and efficiently calculate the option price for the varying input parameters. As a benchmark test, we run the proposed method to price a multi-asset option for the various values of volatilities and present asset prices. We show that, in the tested cases involving up to 11 assets, the proposed method is comparable to or outperforms Monte Carlo simulation with $10^5$ paths in terms of computational complexity, keeping the comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Probing Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state via quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>

Abstract: Recent attention has been drawn to temperature gradient generated $\Delta_T$ noise at vanishing charge current. This study delves into examining the properties of spin-polarised $\Delta T$ noise in conjunction with $\Delta_T$-shot noise, $\Delta_T$-thermal noise, and quantum noise (again both shot and thermal noise) in a one-dimensional (1D) structure comprising metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction to probe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states. YSR bound states, which are localized states within the superconducting gap of a superconductor are induced by a magnetic impurity acting as a spin-flipper. A YSR bound state should be distinguished from a Majorana bound state (MBS), which too can occur due to interaction with magnetic impurities, e.g., magnetic adatoms on superconductors, and this can lead to false positives in detecting MBS. Clarifying this by providing a unique signature for the YSR-bound state is the main aim of this work. In this paper, we show that YSR bound states can be effectively probed using quantum noise and the recently discovered $\Delta_T$ noise, with a focus on especially spin transport. We see that the spin $\Delta_T$ noise is a superior tool compared to the charge $\Delta_T$ noise as a probe for YSR bound states. Additionally, our analysis of quantum noise reveals that similar to $\Delta_T$ noise, spin quantum noise is more effective than charge quantum noise in detecting YSR bound states.</description>
