      <title>Objectively Evaluating the Reliability of Cell Type Annotation Using LLM-Based Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability in cell type annotation is challenging in single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis because both expert-driven and automated methods can be biased or constrained by their training data, especially for novel or rare cell types. Although large language models (LLMs) are useful, our evaluation found that only a few matched expert annotations due to biased data sources and inflexible training inputs. To overcome these limitations, we developed the LICT (Large language model-based Identifier for Cell Types) software package using a multi-model fusion and "talk-to-machine" strategy. Tested across various single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, our approach significantly improved annotation reliability, especially in datasets with low cellular heterogeneity. Notably, we established objective criteria to assess annotation reliability using the "talk-to-machine" approach, which addresses discrepancies between our annotations and expert ones, enabling reliable evaluation even without reference data. This strategy enhances annotation credibility and sets the stage for advancing future LLM-based cell type annotation methods.</description>

      <title>Computational Pathology for Accurate Prediction of Breast Cancer Recurrence: Development and Validation of a Deep Learning-based Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate recurrence risk stratification is crucial for optimizing treatment plans for breast cancer patients. Current prognostic tools like Oncotype DX (ODX) offer valuable genomic insights for HR+/HER2- patients but are limited by cost and accessibility, particularly in underserved populations. In this study, we present Deep-BCR-Auto, a deep learning-based computational pathology approach that predicts breast cancer recurrence risk from routine H&amp;E-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Our methodology was validated on two independent cohorts: the TCGA-BRCA dataset and an in-house dataset from The Ohio State University (OSU). Deep-BCR-Auto demonstrated robust performance in stratifying patients into low- and high-recurrence risk categories. On the TCGA-BRCA dataset, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.827, significantly outperforming existing weakly supervised models (p=0.041). In the independent OSU dataset, Deep-BCR-Auto maintained strong generalizability, achieving an AUROC of 0.832, along with 82.0% accuracy, 85.0% specificity, and 67.7% sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of computational pathology as a cost-effective alternative for recurrence risk assessment, broadening access to personalized treatment strategies. This study underscores the clinical utility of integrating deep learning-based computational pathology into routine pathological assessment for breast cancer prognosis across diverse clinical settings.</description>

      <title>An R package for nonparametric inference on dynamic populations with infinitely many types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fleming-Viot diffusions are widely used stochastic models for population dynamics which extend the celebrated Wright-Fisher diffusions. They describe the temporal evolution of the relative frequencies of the allelic types in an ideally infinite panmictic population, whose individuals undergo random genetic drift and at birth can mutate to a new allelic type drawn from a possibly infinite potential pool, independently of their parent. Recently, Bayesian nonparametric inference has been considered for this model when a finite sample of individuals is drawn from the population at several discrete time points. Previous works have fully described the relevant estimators for this problem, but current software is available only for the Wright-Fisher finite-dimensional case. Here we provide software for the general case, overcoming some non trivial computational challenges posed by this setting. The R package FVDDPpkg efficiently approximates the filtering and smoothing distribution for Fleming-Viot diffusions, given finite samples of individuals collected at different times. A suitable Monte Carlo approximation is also introduced in order to reduce the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference for Non-Linear Regression Models with Applications in Enzyme Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite linear regression being the most popular statistical modelling technique, in real-life we often need to deal with situations where the true relationship between the response and the covariates is nonlinear in parameters. In such cases one needs to adopt appropriate non-linear regression (NLR) analysis, having wider applications in biochemical and medical studies among many others. In this paper we propose a new improved robust estimation and testing methodologies for general NLR models based on the minimum density power divergence approach and apply our proposal to analyze the widely popular Michaelis-Menten (MM) model in enzyme kinetics. We establish the asymptotic properties of our proposed estimator and tests, along with their theoretical robustness characteristics through influence function analysis. For the particular MM model, we have further empirically justified the robustness and the efficiency of our proposed estimator and the testing procedure through extensive simulation studies and several interesting real data examples of enzyme-catalyzed (biochemical) reactions.</description>

      <title>Parameter selection and optimization of a computational network model of blood flow in single-ventricle patients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital heart disease responsible for 23% of infant cardiac deaths each year. HLHS patients are born with an underdeveloped left heart, requiring several surgeries to reconstruct the aorta and create a single ventricle circuit known as the Fontan circulation. While survival into early adulthood is becoming more common, Fontan patients suffer from reduced cardiac output, putting them at risk for a multitude of complications. These patients are monitored using chest and neck MRI imaging, but these scans do not capture energy loss, pressure, wave intensity, or hemodynamics beyond the imaged region. This study develops a framework for predicting these missing features by combining imaging data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Predicted features from models of HLHS patients are compared to those from control patients with a double outlet right ventricle (DORV). We use parameter inference to render the model patient-specific. In the calibrated model, we predict pressure, flow, wave-intensity (WI), and wall shear stress (WSS). Results reveal that HLHS patients have higher vascular stiffness and lower compliance than DORV patients, resulting in lower WSS and higher WI in the ascending aorta and increased WSS and decreased WI in the descending aorta.</description>

      <title>Interpretable statistical representations of neural population dynamics and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of neuron populations commonly evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. Thus, we need methods that learn the dynamical processes over neural manifolds to infer interpretable and consistent latent representations. We introduce a representation learning method, MARBLE, that decomposes on-manifold dynamics into local flow fields and maps them into a common latent space using unsupervised geometric deep learning. In simulated non-linear dynamical systems, recurrent neural networks, and experimental single-neuron recordings from primates and rodents, we discover emergent low-dimensional latent representations that parametrise high-dimensional neural dynamics during gain modulation, decision-making, and changes in the internal state. These representations are consistent across neural networks and animals, enabling the robust comparison of cognitive computations. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art within- and across-animal decoding accuracy of MARBLE compared with current representation learning approaches, with minimal user input. Our results suggest that manifold structure provides a powerful inductive bias to develop powerful decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments.</description>

      <title>Virtual Lung Screening Trial (VLST): An In Silico Replica of the National Lung Screening Trial for Lung Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Importance: Clinical imaging trials are crucial for definitive evaluation of medical innovations, but the process is inefficient, expensive, and ethically-constrained. Virtual imaging trial (VIT) approach address these limitations by emulating the components of a clinical trial. An in silico rendition of the National Lung Screening Trial (NCLS) via Virtual Lung Screening Trial (VLST) demonstrates the promise of VITs to expedite clinical trials, reduce risks to subjects, and facilitate the optimal use of imaging technologies in clinical settings.
  Design, Setting, and Participants: A diverse virtual patient population of 294 subjects was created from human models (XCAT) emulating the characteristics of cases on NLST, with two types of simulated lung nodules. The cohort was assessed using simulated CT and CXR systems to generate images that reflect the NLST imaging technologies. Deep learning models trained for lesion detection in CXR and CT served as virtual readers.
  Results: The study analyzed 294 CT and CXR simulated images from 294 virtual patients, with a lesion- level AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79-0.84) for CT and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.54-0.58) for CXR. At the patient level, CT demonstrated an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.89), compared to 0.52 (95% CI: 0.45-0.58) for CXR. Subgroup analyses on CT results indicated superior detection of homogeneous lesions (lesion-level AUC 0.97) than heterogeneous lesions (lesion-level AUC 0.72). Performance was particularly high for identifying larger nodules (AUC of 0.98 for nodules &gt; 8 mm). The VLST results closely mirrored the NLST, particularly in size-based detection trends, with CT achieving high AUCs for nodules &gt; 8 mm and similar challenges in detecting smaller nodules.
  Conclusion and Relevance: The VIT results closely replicated those of the earlier NLST, underscoring its potential to replicate real clinical imaging trials.</description>

      <title>Prosody of speech production in latent post-stroke aphasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores prosodic production in latent aphasia, a mild form of aphasia associated with left-hemisphere brain damage (e.g. stroke). Unlike prior research on moderate to severe aphasia, we investigated latent aphasia, which can seem to have very similar speech production with neurotypical speech. We analysed the f0, intensity and duration of utterance-initial and utterance-final words of ten speakers with latent aphasia and ten matching controls. Regression models were fitted to improve our understanding of this understudied type of very mild aphasia. The results highlighted varying degrees of differences in all three prosodic measures between groups. We also investigated the diagnostic classification of latent aphasia versus neurotypical control using random forest, aiming to build a fast and reliable tool to assist with the identification of latent aphasia. The random forest analysis also reinforced the significance of prosodic features in distinguishing latent aphasia.</description>
