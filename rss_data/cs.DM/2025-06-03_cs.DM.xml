      <title>Automated Symmetric Constructions in Discrete Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational methodology for obtaining rotationally symmetric sets of points satisfying discrete geometric constraints, and demonstrate its applicability by discovering new solutions to some well-known problems in combinatorial geometry. Our approach takes the usage of SAT solvers in discrete geometry further by directly embedding rotational symmetry into the combinatorial encoding of geometric configurations. Then, to realize concrete point sets corresponding to abstract designs provided by a SAT solver, we introduce a novel local-search realizability solver, which shows excellent practical performance despite the intrinsic $\exists \mathbb{R}$-completeness of the problem. Leveraging this combined approach, we provide symmetric extremal solutions to the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres problem, as well as a minimal odd-sized solution with 21 points for the everywhere-unbalanced-points problem, improving on the previously known 23-point configuration. The imposed symmetries yield more aesthetically appealing solutions, enhancing human interpretability, and simultaneously offer computational benefits by significantly reducing the number of variables required to encode discrete geometric problems.</description>

      <title>The random $k$-SAT Gibbs uniqueness threshold revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any $k\geq3$ for clause/variable ratios up to the Gibbs uniqueness threshold of the corresponding Galton-Watson tree, the number of satisfying assignments of random $k$-SAT formulas is given by the `replica symmetric solution' predicted by physics methods [Monasson, Zecchina: Phys. Rev. Lett. (1996)]. Furthermore, while the Gibbs uniqueness threshold is still not known precisely for any $k\geq3$, we derive new lower bounds on this threshold that improve over prior work [Montanari and Shah: SODA (2007)].The improvement is significant particularly for small $k$.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Stochastic Assignment Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a two-stage stochastic version of the assignment game, which is a fundamental cooperative game. Given an initial setting, the set of players may change in the second stage according to some probability distribution, and the goal is to find core solutions that are minimally modified.
  When the probability distribution is given explicitly, we observe that the problem is polynomial time solvable, as it can be modeled as an LP. More interestingly, we prove that the underlying polyhedron is integral, and exploit this in two ways.
  First, integrality of the polyhedron allows us to show that the problem can be well approximated when the distribution is unknown, which is a hard setting.
  Second, we can establish an intimate connection to the well-studied multistage vertex cover problem. Here, it is known that the problem is NP-hard even when there are only 2 stages and the graph in each stage is bipartite. As a byproduct of our result, we can prove that the problem is polynomial-time solvable if the bipartition is the same in each stage.</description>

      <title>On surjectivity and dynamical properties of dill maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study certain dynamical properties of dill maps, a class of functions introduced in~\cite{salo2015block} that generalizes both cellular automata and substitutions. In particular, we prove that surjective uniform dill maps are precisely the surjective cellular automata. We also establish a sufficient condition for a dill map to be equicontinuous.</description>

      <title>On the Conjecture of the Representation Number of Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the problem of determining the representation number of an arbitrary word-representable graph is NP-hard, this problem is open even for bipartite graphs. The representation numbers are known for certain bipartite graphs including all the graphs with at most nine vertices. For bipartite graphs with partite sets of sizes $m$ and $n$, Glen et al. conjectured that the representation number is at most $\lceil \frac{m+n}{4}\rceil$, where $m+n \ge 9$.
  In this paper, we show that every bipartite graph is $\left( 1+ \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil \right)$-representable, where $m$ is the size of its smallest partite set. Furthermore, if $m$ is odd then we prove that the bipartite graphs are $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil $-representable. Accordingly, we establish that the conjecture by Glen et al. holds good for all bipartite graphs leaving the bipartite graphs whose partite sets are of equal and even size. In case of the bipartite graphs with partite sets of equal and even size, we prove the conjecture for certain subclasses using the neighborhood inclusion graph approach.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Spectral Partitioning Works: Bounds for Special Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral partitioning is a method that can be used to compute small sparse cuts or small edge-separators in a wide variety of graph classes, by computing the second-smallest eigenvalue (and eigenvector) of the Laplacian matrix. Upper bounds on this eigenvalue for certain graph classes imply that the method obtains small edge-separators for these classes, usually with a sub-optimal dependence on the maximum degree. In this work, we show that a related method, called reweighted spectral partitioning, guarantees near-optimal sparse vertex-cuts and vertex-separators in a wide variety of graph classes. In many cases, this involves little-to-no necessary dependence on maximum degree.
  We also obtain a new proof of the planar separator theorem, a strengthened eigenvalue bound for bounded-genus graphs, and a refined form of the recent Cheeger-style inequality for vertex expansion via a specialized dimension-reduction step.</description>

      <title>Feature-aware Hypergraph Generation via Next-Scale Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs generalize traditional graphs by allowing hyperedges to connect multiple nodes, making them well-suited for modeling complex structures with higher-order relationships, such as 3D meshes, molecular systems, and electronic circuits. While topology is central to hypergraph structure, many real-world applications also require node and hyperedge features. Existing hypergraph generation methods focus solely on topology, often overlooking feature modeling. In this work, we introduce FAHNES (feature-aware hypergraph generation via next-scale prediction), a hierarchical approach that jointly generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES builds a multi-scale representation through node coarsening, then learns to reconstruct finer levels via localized expansion and refinement, guided by a new node budget mechanism that controls cluster splitting. We evaluate FAHNES on synthetic hypergraphs, 3D meshes, and molecular datasets. FAHNES achieves competitive results in reconstructing topology and features, establishing a foundation for future research in featured hypergraph generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Counting overlapping pairs of words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A correlation is a binary vector that encodes all possible positions of overlaps of two words, where an overlap for an ordered pair of words (u,v) occurs if a suffix of word u matches a prefix of word v. As multiple pairs can have the same correlation, it is relevant to count how many pairs of words share the same correlation depending on the alphabet size and word length n. We exhibit recurrences to compute the number of such pairs -- which is termed population size -- for any correlation; for this, we exploit a relationship between overlaps of two words and self-overlap of one word. This theorem allows us to compute the number of pairs with a longest overlap of a given length and to show that the expected length of the longest border of two words asymptotically converges, which solves two open questions raised by Gabric in 2022. Finally, we also provide bounds for the asymptotic of the population ratio of any correlation. Given the importance of word overlaps in areas like word combinatorics, bioinformatics, and digital communication, our results may ease analyses of algorithms for string processing, code design, or genome assembly.</description>

      <title>The repetition threshold for ternary rich words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie, Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper, we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the big Ramsey degrees of every countable universal $u$-uniform $\omega$-edge-labeled hypergraph are infinite for every $u\geq 2$. Together with a recent result of Braunfeld, Chodounsk\'y, de Rancourt, Hubi\v{c}ka, Kawach, and Kone\v{c}n\'y this finishes full characterisation of unrestricted relational structures with finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Big Ramsey degrees of Fra\"iss\'e limits of finitely constrained free amalgamation classes in finite binary languages have been recently fully characterised by Balko, Chodounsk\'y, Dobrinen, Hubi\v{c}ka, Kone\v{c}n\'y, Vena, and Zucker. A special case of this characterisation is the universal homogeneous $K_4$-free graph. We give a self-contained and relatively compact presentation of this case and compute the actual big Ramsey degrees of small graphs.</description>
