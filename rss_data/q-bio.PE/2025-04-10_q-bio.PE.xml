      <title>Using theory-driven Integrated Population Models to evaluate competitive outcomes in stage-structured systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting competitive outcomes typically requires fitting dynamical models to data, from which interaction strengths and coexistence indicators such as invasion criteria can be produced. Methods that allow to propagate parameter uncertainty are particularly indicated. These should ideally allow for competition between and within species at various life-stages, and make the best out of multiple data sources, each of which can be relatively scarce by statistical standards. Here, we embed a mathematical model of stage-structured competition between two species, producing analytical invasion criteria, into a two-species Integrated Population Model. The community-level IPM allows to combine counts, capture-recapture, and fecundity data into a single statistical framework, and the Bayesian formulation of the IPM fully propagates parameter uncertainty into invasion criteria. Model fitting demonstrates that we can correctly predict coexistence through reciprocal invasion when present, but that interaction strengths are not always estimable, depending on the prior chosen. Our competitive exclusion scenario is shown to be harder to identify, although our model allows to at least flag this scenario as uncertain rather than mistakenly present it as coexistence. Our results confirm the importance of accounting for uncertainty in the prediction of competitive outcomes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport models for fluid classification: insights from an experimentally driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, research and development in nanoscale science and technology have grown significantly, with electrical transport playing a key role. A natural challenge for its description is to shed light on anomalous behaviours observed in a variety of low-dimensional systems. We use a synergistic combination of experimental and mathematical modelling to explore the transport properties of the electrical discharge observed within a micro-gap based sensor immersed in fluids with different insulating properties. Data from laboratory experiments are collected and used to inform and calibrate four mathematical models that comprise partial differential equations describing different kinds of transport, including anomalous diffusion: the Gaussian Model with Time Dependent Diffusion Coefficient, the Porous Medium Equation, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Equation and the Telegrapher Equation. Performance analysis of the models through data fitting reveals that the Gaussian Model with a Time-Dependent Diffusion Coefficient most effectively describes the observed phenomena. This model proves particularly valuable in characterizing the transport properties of electrical discharges when the micro-electrodes are immersed in a wide range of insulating as well as conductive fluids. Indeed, it can suitably reproduce a range of behaviours spanning from clogging to bursts, allowing accurate and quite general fluid classification. Finally, we apply the data-driven mathematical modeling approach to ethanol-water mixtures. The results show the model's potential for accurate prediction, making it a promising method for analyzing and classifying fluids with unknown insulating properties.</description>

      <title>Estimation of rates in population-age-dependent processes by means of test functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop practical applications of the model for the highly technical measure-valued populations developed by the authors in \cite{FanEtal20}. We consider the problem of estimation of parameters in the general age and population-dependent model, in which the individual birth and death rates depend not only on the age of the individual but also on the whole population composition. We derive new estimators of the rates based on the use of test functions in the functional Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for populations with a large carrying capacity. We consider the rates to be simple functions, that take finitely many values both in age $x$ and measure $A$, which leads to systems of linear equations. The proposed method of using test functions for estimation is a radically new approach which can be applied to a wide range of models of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of critical cascades in interdependent networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of interdependent networks, as well as similar avalanche phenomena, is driven by cascading failures. At the critical point, the cascade begins as a critical branching process, where each failing node (element) triggers, on average, the failure of one other node. As nodes continue to fail, the network becomes increasingly fragile and the branching factor grows. If the failure process does not reach extinction during its critical phase, the network undergoes an abrupt collapse. Here, we implement the analogy between this dynamic and birth-death processes to derive new analytical results and significantly optimize numerical calculations. Using this approach, we analyze three key aspects of the dynamics: the probability of collapse, the duration of avalanches, and the length of the cascading plateau phase preceding a collapse. This analysis quantifies how system size and the intensity of the initial triggering event influence these characteristics.</description>

      <title>Impact of heterogeneity on infection probability: Insights from single-hit dose-response models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of infection of a host is complex, influenced by factors such as microbial variation within and between hosts as well as differences in dose across hosts. This study uses dose-response and within-host microbial infection models to delve into the impact of these factors on infection probability. It is rigorously demonstrated that within-host heterogeneity in microbial infectivity enhances the probability of infection. The effect of infectivity and dose variation between hosts is studied in terms of the expected value of the probability of infection. General analytical findings, derived under the assumption of small infectivity, reveal that both types of heterogeneity reduce the expected infection probability. Interestingly, this trend appears consistent across specific dose-response models, suggesting a limited role for the small infectivity condition. Additionally, the vital dynamics behind heterogeneous infectivity are investigated with a within-host microbial growth model which enhances the biological significance of single-hit dose-response models. Testing these mathematical predictions inspire new and challenging laboratory experiments that could deepen our understanding of infections.</description>

      <title>Reducing phenotype-structured PDE models of cancer evolution to systems of ODEs: a generalised moment dynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity is nowadays understood to play a critical role in disease progression and treatment failure. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in the development of mathematical models capable of capturing its role in cancer cell adaptation. This can be systematically achieved by means of models comprising phenotype-structured nonlocal partial differential equations, tracking the evolution of the phenotypic density distribution of the cell population, which may be compared to gene and protein expression distributions obtained experimentally. Nevertheless, given the high analytical and computational cost of solving these models, much is to be gained from reducing them to systems of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the distribution. We propose a generalised method of model-reduction, relying on the use of a moment generating function, Taylor series expansion and truncation closure, to reduce a nonlocal reaction-advection-diffusion equation, with general phenotypic drift and proliferation rate functions, to a system of moment equations up to arbitrary order. Our method extends previous results in the literature, which we address via two examples, by removing any \textit{a priori} assumption on the shape of the distribution, and provides a flexible framework for mathematical modellers to account for the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer adaptive dynamics, in a simpler mathematical framework.</description>

      <title>Sunlight-heated refugia protect frogs from chytridiomycosis: a mathematical modelling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fungal disease Chytridiomycosis poses a threat to frog populations worldwide. It has driven over 90 amphibian species to extinction and severely affected hundreds more. Difficulties in disease management have shown a need for novel conservation approaches.
  We present a novel mathematical model for chytridiomycosis transmission in frogs that includes the natural history of infection, to test the hypothesis that sunlight-heated refugia reduce transmission. This model was fit using approximate Bayesian computation to experimental data where frogs were grouped into sunlight-heated or shaded refugia cohorts.
  Results show a 40% reduction in infection due to sunlight-heating of refugia. Frogs that were infected and recovered had a reduction in susceptibility of approximately 97% compared to na\"ive frogs. Our model offers insight into using sunlight-heated refugia to reduce chytridiomycosis prevalence. Importantly, it is the first step in determining the necessary level of refugia in the landscape for frog population recovery and population sustainability.</description>

      <title>Threshold-based impulsive biocontrol for coffee leaf rust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coffee leaf rust (CLR) severely affects coffee production worldwide, leading to reduced yields and economic losses. To reduce the cost of control, small-scale farmers often only apply control measures once a noticeable level of infection is reached. In this work, we develop mathematical models to better understand CLR dynamics and impulsive biocontrol with threshold-based interventions. We first use ordinary and impulsive differential equations to describe disease spread and the application of control measures once a certain infection level is detected. These models help determine when and how often interventions should occur. To capture the early stages of the disease and the chance that it might die out by itself, we then use a continuous-time Markov chain approach. This stochastic model allows us to estimate the probability that the pathogen fails to establish, thereby avoiding serious outbreaks.</description>
