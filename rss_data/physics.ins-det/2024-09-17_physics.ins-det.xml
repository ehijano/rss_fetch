      <title>Endoscopic Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy through a fiber microprobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a powerful analytical method for not only the chemical identification of solid, liquid, and gas species, but also the quantification of their concentration. However, the chemical quantification capability of FTIR is significantly hindered when the analyte is surrounded by a strong IR absorbing medium, such as liquid solutions. To overcome this limit, here we develop an IR fiber microprobe that can be inserted into liquid medium, and obtain full FTIR spectra at points of interest. To benchmark this endoscopic FTIR method, we insert the microprobe into bulk water covering a ZnSe substrate and measure the IR transmittance of water as a function of the probe-substrate distance. The obtained vibrational modes, overall transmittance vs z profiles, quantitative absorption coefficients, and micro z-section IR transmittance spectra are all consistent with the standard IR absorption properties of water. The results pave the way for endoscopic chemical profiling inside bulk liquid solutions, promising for applications in many biological, chemical, and electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic microwave performance of silicon nitride and amorphous silicon deposited using low-temperature ICPCVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of dielectrics at low temperature is required for temperature-sensitive detectors. For superconducting detectors, such as transition edge sensors and kinetic inductance detectors, AlMn is widely studied due to its variable superconducting transition temperature at different baking temperatures. Experimentally only the highest baking temperature determines AlMn transition temperature, so we need to control the wafer temperature during the whole process. In general, the highest process temperature happens during dielectric fabrication. Here, we present the cryogenic microwave performance of Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$, SiN$_{x}$ and $\alpha$-Si using ICPCVD at low temperature of 75 $^{\circ}$C. The dielectric constant, internal quality factor and TLS properties are studied using Al parallel plate resonators.</description>

      <title>Evaluating probabilistic and data-driven inference models for fiber-coupled NV-diamond temperature sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the impact of inference model on uncertainties when using continuous wave Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) measurements to infer temperature. Our approach leverages a probabilistic feedforward inference model designed to maximize the likelihood of observed ODMR spectra through automatic differentiation. This model effectively utilizes the temperature dependence of spin Hamiltonian parameters to infer temperature from spectral features in the ODMR data. We achieve prediction uncertainty of $\pm$ 1 K across a temperature range of 243 K to 323 K. To benchmark our probabilistic model, we compare it with a non-parametric peak-finding technique and data-driven methodologies such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We find that when validated against out-of-sample dataset that encompasses the same temperature range as the training dataset, data driven methods can show uncertainties that are as much as 0.67 K lower without incorporating expert-level understanding of the spectroscopic-temperature relationship. However, our results show that the probabilistic model outperforms both PCR and CNN when tasked with extrapolating beyond the temperature range used in training set, indicating robustness and generalizability. In contrast, data-driven methods like PCR and CNN demonstrate up to ten times worse uncertainties when tasked with extrapolating outside their training data range.</description>

      <title>OpenDosimeter: Open Hardware Personal X-ray Dosimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OpenDosimeter (https://opendosimeter.org/), an open hardware solution for real-time personal X-ray dose monitoring based on a scintillation counter. Using an X-ray sensor assembly (LYSO + SiPM) on a custom board powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, OpenDosimeter provides real-time feedback (1 Hz), data logging (10 hours), and battery-powered operation. One of the core innovations is that we calibrate the device using $^{241}$Am found in ionization smoke detectors. Specifically, we use the $\gamma$-emissions to spectrally calibrate the dosimeter, then calculate the effective dose from X-ray exposure by compensating for the scintillator absorption efficiency and applying energy-to-dose coefficients derived from tabulated data in the ICRP 116 publication. We demonstrate that this transparent approach enables real-time dose rate readings with a linear response between 0.1-1000 $\mu$Sv/h at $\pm$25% accuracy, tested for energies up to 120 keV. The maximum dose rate readings are limited by pile-up effects when approaching count rate saturation ($\sim$77 kcps at $\sim$13 $\mu$s average pulse processing time). The total component cost for making an OpenDosimeter is &lt;\$100, which, combined with its open design (both hardware and software), enables cost-effective local reproducibility on a global scale. This paper complements the open-source documentation by explaining the underlying technology, the algorithm for dose calculation, and areas for future improvement.</description>

      <title>Electrical capacitance volume sensor for microgravity mass gauging: Advancements in sensor calibration for microgravity fluid configurations and propellant management devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgravity mass gauging has gained increasing importance in recent years due to the acceleration in planning for long-term space missions as well as in-space refueling and transfer operations. It is of particular importance with cryogenic propellants where periodic tank venting maneuvers and leak detection place a special emphasis on accurate mass gauging. Several competing technologies have arisen, but capacitance mass gauging has several distinct advantages due to its low mass, non-intrusiveness, and whole volume interrogation technique. Capacitance based measurement has also seen recent success in measuring cryogenic liquid nitrogen and hydrogen volume fraction and flow rate, showing its compatibility with cryogenic propellants. However, the effects of gravity on fluid behavior make the calibration and testing of these sensors difficult on the ground. In this paper a prototype sensor is constructed that can emulate fluid positions in microgravity and earth gravity configurations. Experimental propellant fills and drains are conducted using a simulant fluid with similar electrical properties to cryogenic propellants. This expanded dataset is compared with previous simulation results and used to construct a machine learning model capable of calculating the fluid mass in tanks both with and without propellant management devices.</description>

      <title>Zero- to Ultralow-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) is an NMR modality where experiments are performed in fields at which spin-spin interactions within molecules and materials are stronger than Zeeman interactions. This typically occurs at external fields of microtesla strength or below, considerably smaller than Earth's field. In ZULF NMR, the measurement of spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive means for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting sample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong external magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up new capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to the preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging. Furthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio band, the nuclear spins can be addressed with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and highly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to high-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive materials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not produce resonance line broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible. Notable practical advantages of ZULF NMR spectroscopy are the low cost and relative simplicity and portability of the spectrometer system. In recent years ZULF NMR has become more accessible, thanks to improvements in magnetometer sensitivity and their commercial availability, and the development of hyperpolarization methods that provide a simple means to boost signal strengths by several orders of magnitude. These topics are reviewed and a perspective on potential future avenues of ZULF-NMR research is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to cavity ring-down spectroscopy utilizing an optical frequency comb as the direct probe of the Fabry-Perot cavity, coupled with a time-resolved Fourier transform spectrometer for parallel retrieval of ring-down events. Our method achieves high spectral resolution over a broad range, enabling precision measurements of cavity losses and absorption lineshapes with enhanced sensitivity. A critical advancement involves a stabilization technique ensuring complete extinction of comb light without compromising cavity stabilization. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system through precision spectroscopy of carbon monoxide rovibrational transitions perturbed by argon.</description>

      <title>SciDVS: A Scientific Event Camera with 1.7% Temporal Contrast Sensitivity at 0.7 lux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) event camera that is 6x more sensitive at 14x lower illumination than existing commercial and prototype cameras. Event cameras output a sparse stream of brightness change events. Their high dynamic range (HDR), quick response, and high temporal resolution provide key advantages for scientific applications that involve low lighting conditions and sparse visual events. However, current DVS are hindered by low sensitivity, resulting from shot noise and pixel-to-pixel mismatch. Commercial DVS have a minimum brightness change threshold of &gt;10%. Sensitive prototypes achieved as low as 1%, but required kilo-lux illumination. Our SciDVS prototype fabricated in a 180nm CMOS image sensor process achieves 1.7% sensitivity at chip illumination of 0.7 lx and 18 Hz bandwidth. Novel features of SciDVS are (1) an auto-centering in-pixel preamplifier providing intrascene HDR and increased sensitivity, (2) improved control of bandwidth to limit shot noise, and (3) optional pixel binning, allowing the user to trade spatial resolution for sensitivity.</description>

      <title>J-UBIK: The JAX-accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from multiple instruments. To facilitate the high-fidelity imaging of these signals, we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we present J-UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the JAX-accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J-UBIK streamlines the implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X-ray observations, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for the near- and mid-infrared. The aim is to expand this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J-UBIK enables efficient generation of high-fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored to specific research objectives.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the fractional radiation length of a pixel module for the CMS Phase-2 upgrade via the multiple scattering of positrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-luminosity particle collider experiments such as the ones planned at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider require ever-greater vertexing precision of the tracking detectors, necessitating also reductions in the material budget of the detectors. Traditionally, the fractional radiation length ($x/X_0$) of detectors is either estimated using known properties of the constituent materials, or measured in dedicated runs of the final detector. In this paper, we present a method of direct measurement of the material budget of a CMS prototype module designed for the Phase-2 upgrade of the CMS detector using a 40-65 MeV positron beam. A total of 630 million events were collected at the Paul Scherrer Institut PiE1 experimental area using a three-plane telescope consisting of the prototype module as the central plane, surrounded by two MALTA monolithic pixel detectors. Fractional radiation lengths were extracted from scattering angle distributions using the Highland approximation for multiple scattering. A statistical technique recovered runs suffering from trigger desynchronisation, and several corrections were introduced to compensate for local inefficiencies related to geometric and beam shape constraints. Two regions of the module were surveyed and yielded average $x/X_0$ values of $(0.72 \pm 0.05)\%$ and $(0.95 \pm 0.09)\%$, which are compatible with empirical estimates for these regions computed from known material properties of 0.753% and 0.892%, respectively. Higher-granularity maps of the fractional radiation length were produced for both rectangular regions and regions of uniform material composition. The results bode well for the CMS Phase-2 upgrade modules, which will play a key role in the minimisation of the material budget of the upgraded detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RD50-MPW4 is the latest HV-CMOS pixel sensor from the CERN-RD50-CMOS working group, designed to evaluate the HV-CMOS technology in terms of spatial resolution, radiation hardness and timing performance. Fabricated by LFoundry using a 150nm process, it features an improved architecture to mitigate crosstalk, which has been an issue with the predecessor RD50-MPW3, allowing more sensitive threshold settings and full matrix operation. Enhancements include separated power domains for peripheral and in-pixel digital readout, a new backside-biasing step, and an improved guard ring structure supporting biasing up to 500V, significantly boosting radiation hardness. Laboratory measurements and test beam results presented in this paper show significant improvements over its predecessor regarding noise behavior, spatial resolution, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sensitivity in Ge-Based Rare-Event Physics Experiments through Underground Crystal Growth and Detector Fabrication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmogenic production of long-lived isotopes such as $^{3}$H,$^{55}$Fe, $^{60}$Co, $^{65}$Zn, and $^{68}$Ge poses a significant challenge as a source of background events in Ge-based dark matter (DM) and neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) experiments. In the pursuit of DM, particularly within the largely unexplored parameter space for low-mass DM, new detector technologies are being developed with extremely low-energy thresholds to detect MeV-scale DM. However, isotopes like $^{3}$H, $^{55}$Fe, $^{65}$Zn, and $^{68}$Ge, produced cosmogenically within the detector material, emerge as dominant backgrounds that severely limit sensitivity in these searches. Similarly, efforts to detect $0\nu\beta\beta$, especially under a neutrino normal mass hierarchy scenario, require a sensitivity to the effective Majorana mass of $\sim$1 meV. Achieving this level of sensitivity necessitates stringent suppression of background signals from isotopes such as $^{60}$Co and $^{68}$Ge, which impose critical detection limits. To reach the targeted sensitivity for these next-generation experiments and to unlock their full discovery potential for both low-mass DM and $0\nu\beta\beta$, relocating Ge crystal growth and detector fabrication to underground environments is crucial. This approach is the most effective strategy to significantly reduce the production of these long-lived isotopes, thereby ensuring the experimental sensitivity required for groundbreaking discoveries.</description>

      <title>Toward Microgravity Mass Gauging with Electrical Capacitance Volume Sensing: Sensor Design and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of capacitance sensors for fuel mass gauging has been in consideration since the early days of manned space flight. However, certain difficulties arise when considering tanks in microgravity environments. Surface tension effects lead to fluid wetting of the interior surface of the tank, leaving large interior voids, while thrust/settling effects can lead to dispersed two-phase mixtures. With the exception of capacitance-based sensing, few sensing technologies are well suited for measuring annular, stratified, and dispersed fluid configurations. Two modalities of capacitance measurement are compared: Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) and Electrical Capacitance Volume Sensing (ECVS). ECVT is a non-invasive imaging modality first introduced in 2006. ECVS is a measurement modality introduced in this paper that is derived from ECVT technology but does not reconstruct an image as part of the mass measurement. To optimize the design of future capacitance-based spherical tank mass gauging sensors, different electrode plate layouts are evaluated in a mass gauging context. Prototype sensors are constructed, and experiments are conducted with fluid fills in various orientations. The plate layouts and their effect on the performance of the sensor as a fuel mass gauge are analyzed through the use of imaging and averaging techniques.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous methods to align beamlines can decrease the amount of time spent on diagnostics, and also uncover better global optima leading to better beam quality. The alignment of these beamlines is a high-dimensional, expensive-to-sample optimization problem involving the simultaneous treatment of many optical elements with correlated and nonlinear dynamics. Bayesian optimization is a strategy of efficient global optimization that has proved successful in similar regimes in a wide variety of beamline alignment applications, though it has typically been implemented for particular beamlines and optimization tasks. In this paper, we present a basic formulation of Bayesian inference and Gaussian process models as they relate to multiobjective Bayesian optimization, as well as the practical challenges presented by beamline alignment. We show that the same general implementation of Bayesian optimization with special consideration for beamline alignment can quickly learn the dynamics of particular beamlines in an online fashion through hyperparameter fitting with no prior information. We present the implementation of a concise software framework for beamline alignment and test it on four different optimization problems for experiments at x-ray beamlines of the National Synchrotron Light Source II and the Advanced Light Source and an electron beam at the Accelerator Test Facility, along with benchmarking on a simulated digital twin. We discuss new applications of the framework, and the potential for a unified approach to beamline alignment at synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11276</link>

Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed</description>
