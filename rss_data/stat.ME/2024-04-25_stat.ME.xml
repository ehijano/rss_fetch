      <title>Double Robust Variance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly robust estimators have gained popularity in the field of causal inference due to their ability to provide consistent point estimates when either an outcome or exposure model is correctly specified. However, the influence function based variance estimator frequently used with doubly robust estimators is only consistent when both the outcome and exposure models are correctly specified. Here, use of M-estimation and the empirical sandwich variance estimator for doubly robust point and variance estimation is demonstrated. Simulation studies illustrate the properties of the influence function based and empirical sandwich variance estimators. Estimators are applied to data from the Improving Pregnancy Outcomes with Progesterone (IPOP) trial to estimate the effect of maternal anemia on birth weight among women with HIV. In the example, birth weights if all women had anemia were estimated to be lower than birth weights if no women had anemia, though estimates were imprecise. Variance estimates were more stable under varying model specifications for the empirical sandwich variance estimator than the influence function based variance estimator.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spatial Context: A Comprehensive Bibliography of GWR and MGWR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local spatial models such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) serve as instrumental tools to capture intrinsic contextual effects through the estimates of the local intercepts and behavioral contextual effects through estimates of the local slope parameters. GWR and MGWR provide simple implementation yet powerful frameworks that could be extended to various disciplines that handle spatial data. This bibliography aims to serve as a comprehensive compilation of peer-reviewed papers that have utilized GWR or MGWR as a primary analytical method to conduct spatial analyses and acts as a useful guide to anyone searching the literature for previous examples of local statistical modeling in a wide variety of application fields.</description>

      <title>On Neighbourhood Cross Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown how to efficiently and accurately compute and optimize a range of cross validation criteria for a wide range of models estimated by minimizing a quadratically penalized smooth loss. Example models include generalized additive models for location scale and shape and smooth additive quantile regression. Example losses include negative log likelihoods and smooth quantile losses. Example cross validation criteria include leave-out-neighbourhood cross validation for dealing with un-modelled short range autocorrelation as well as the more familiar leave-one-out cross validation. For a $p$ coefficient model of $n$ data, estimable at $O(np^2)$ computational cost, the general $O(n^2p^2)$ cost of ordinary cross validation is reduced to $O(np^2)$, computing the cross validation criterion to $O(p^3n^{-2})$ accuracy. This is achieved by directly approximating the model coefficient estimates under data subset omission, via efficiently computed single step Newton updates of the full data coefficient estimates. Optimization of the resulting cross validation criterion, with respect to multiple smoothing/precision parameters, can be achieved efficiently using quasi-Newton optimization, adapted to deal with the indefiniteness that occurs when the optimal value for a smoothing parameter tends to infinity. The link between cross validation and the jackknife can be exploited to achieve reasonably well calibrated uncertainty quantification for the model coefficients in non standard settings such as leaving-out-neighbourhoods under residual autocorrelation or quantile regression. Several practical examples are provided, focussing particularly on dealing with un-modelled auto-correlation.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Ordinal Classification with Marginal and Conditional Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a general distribution-free approach for constructing prediction sets combined with any machine learning algorithm that achieve valid marginal or conditional coverage in finite samples. Ordinal classification is common in real applications where the target variable has natural ordering among the class labels. In this paper, we discuss constructing distribution-free prediction sets for such ordinal classification problems by leveraging the ideas of conformal prediction and multiple testing with FWER control. Newer conformal prediction methods are developed for constructing contiguous and non-contiguous prediction sets based on marginal and conditional (class-specific) conformal $p$-values, respectively. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods respectively achieve satisfactory levels of marginal and class-specific conditional coverages. Through simulation study and real data analysis, these proposed methods show promising performance compared to the existing conformal method.</description>

      <title>Understanding Reliability from a Regression Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability is an important quantification of measurement precision based on a latent variable measurement model. Inspired by McDonald (2011), we present a regression framework of reliability, placing emphasis on whether latent or observed scores serve as the regression outcome. Our theory unifies two extant perspectives of reliability: (a) classical test theory (measurement decomposition), and (b) optimal prediction of latent scores (prediction decomposition). Importantly, reliability should be treated as a property of the observed score under a measurement decomposition, but a property of the latent score under a prediction decomposition. To facilitate the evaluation and interpretation of distinct reliability coefficients for complex measurement models, we introduce a Monte Carlo approach for approximate calculation of reliability. We illustrate the proposed computational procedure with an empirical data analysis, which concerns measuring susceptibility and severity of depressive symptoms using a two-dimensional item response theory model. We conclude with a discussion on computing reliability coefficients and outline future avenues of research.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Covariate-Adjusted and Interpretable Generalized Factor Model with Application to Testing Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of data explosion, statisticians have been developing interpretable and computationally efficient statistical methods to measure latent factors (e.g., skills, abilities, and personalities) using large-scale assessment data. In addition to understanding the latent information, the covariate effect on responses controlling for latent factors is also of great scientific interest and has wide applications, such as evaluating the fairness of educational testing, where the covariate effect reflects whether a test question is biased toward certain individual characteristics (e.g., gender and race) taking into account their latent abilities. However, the large sample size, substantial covariate dimension, and great test length pose challenges to developing efficient methods and drawing valid inferences. Moreover, to accommodate the commonly encountered discrete types of responses, nonlinear latent factor models are often assumed, bringing further complexity to the problem. To address these challenges, we consider a covariate-adjusted generalized factor model and develop novel and interpretable conditions to address the identifiability issue. Based on the identifiability conditions, we propose a joint maximum likelihood estimation method and establish estimation consistency and asymptotic normality results for the covariate effects under a practical yet challenging asymptotic regime. Furthermore, we derive estimation and inference results for latent factors and the factor loadings. We illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method through extensive numerical studies and an application to an educational assessment dataset obtained from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).</description>

      <title>Estimating the Number of Components in Finite Mixture Models via Variational Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new method for selecting the number of components in finite mixture models (FMMs) using variational Bayes, inspired by the large-sample properties of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) derived from mean-field (MF) variational approximation. Specifically, we establish matching upper and lower bounds for the ELBO without assuming conjugate priors, suggesting the consistency of model selection for FMMs based on maximizing the ELBO. As a by-product of our proof, we demonstrate that the MF approximation inherits the stable behavior (benefited from model singularity) of the posterior distribution, which tends to eliminate the extra components under model misspecification where the number of mixture components is over-specified. This stable behavior also leads to the $n^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for parameter estimation, up to a logarithmic factor, under this model overspecification. Empirical experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings and compare with other state-of-the-art methods for selecting the number of components in FMMs.</description>

      <title>Estimating Metocean Environments Associated with Extreme Structural Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme value analysis (EVA) uses data to estimate long-term extreme environmental conditions for variables such as significant wave height and period, for the design of marine structures. Together with models for the short-term evolution of the ocean environment and for wave-structure interaction, EVA provides a basis for full probabilistic design analysis. Environmental contours provide an alternate approach to estimating structural integrity, without requiring structural knowledge. These contour methods also exploit statistical models, including EVA, but avoid the need for structural modelling by making what are believed to be conservative assumptions about the shape of the structural failure boundary in the environment space. These assumptions, however, may not always be appropriate, or may lead to unnecessary wasted resources from over design. We introduce a methodology for full probabilistic analysis to estimate the joint probability density of the environment, conditional on the occurrence of an extreme structural response, for simple structures. We use this conditional density of the environment as a basis to assess the performance of different environmental contour methods. We demonstrate the difficulty of estimating the contour boundary in the environment space for typical data samples, as well as the dependence of the performance of the environmental contour on the structure being considered.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Federated Learning: Servers Trustworthiness, Estimation, and Statistical Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private federated learning is crucial for maintaining privacy in distributed environments. This paper investigates the challenges of high-dimensional estimation and inference under the constraints of differential privacy. First, we study scenarios involving an untrusted central server, demonstrating the inherent difficulties of accurate estimation in high-dimensional problems. Our findings indicate that the tight minimax rates depends on the high-dimensionality of the data even with sparsity assumptions. Second, we consider a scenario with a trusted central server and introduce a novel federated estimation algorithm tailored for linear regression models. This algorithm effectively handles the slight variations among models distributed across different machines. We also propose methods for statistical inference, including coordinate-wise confidence intervals for individual parameters and strategies for simultaneous inference. Extensive simulation experiments support our theoretical advances, underscoring the efficacy and reliability of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for Stationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time. In particular, for a Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate direct solves with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</description>

      <title>Direct covariance matrix estimation with compositional data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositional data arise in many areas of research in the natural and biomedical sciences. One prominent example is in the study of the human gut microbiome, where one can measure the relative abundance of many distinct microorganisms in a subject's gut. Often, practitioners are interested in learning how the dependencies between microbes vary across distinct populations or experimental conditions. In statistical terms, the goal is to estimate a covariance matrix for the (latent) log-abundances of the microbes in each of the populations. However, the compositional nature of the data prevents the use of standard estimators for these covariance matrices. In this article, we propose an estimator of multiple covariance matrices which allows for information sharing across distinct populations of samples. Compared to some existing estimators, which estimate the covariance matrices of interest indirectly, our estimator is direct, ensures positive definiteness, and is the solution to a convex optimization problem. We compute our estimator using a proximal-proximal gradient descent algorithm. Asymptotic properties of our estimator reveal that it can perform well in high-dimensional settings. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our estimator can outperform existing estimators. We show that our method provides more reliable estimates than competitors in an analysis of microbiome data from subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Variable Selection for Function-on-Scalar Regression Models: a comparative analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we developed a new Bayesian method for variable selection in function-on-scalar regression (FOSR). Our method uses a hierarchical Bayesian structure and latent variables to enable an adaptive covariate selection process for FOSR. Extensive simulation studies show the proposed method's main properties, such as its accuracy in estimating the coefficients and high capacity to select variables correctly. Furthermore, we conducted a substantial comparative analysis with the main competing methods, the BGLSS (Bayesian Group Lasso with Spike and Slab prior) method, the group LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), the group MCP (Minimax Concave Penalty), and the group SCAD (Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation). Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is superior in correctly selecting covariates compared with the existing competing methods while maintaining a satisfactory level of goodness of fit. In contrast, the competing methods could not balance selection accuracy with goodness of fit. We also considered a COVID-19 dataset and some socioeconomic data from Brazil as an application and obtained satisfactory results. In short, the proposed Bayesian variable selection model is highly competitive, showing significant predictive and selective quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for causal inference and play a pivotal role in modern evidence-based medicine. However, the sample sizes they use are often too limited to draw significant causal conclusions for subgroups that are less prevalent in the population. In contrast, observational data are becoming increasingly accessible in large volumes but can be subject to bias as a result of hidden confounding. Given these complementary features, we propose a power likelihood approach to augmenting RCTs with observational data to improve the efficiency of treatment effect estimation. We provide a data-adaptive procedure for maximizing the expected log predictive density (ELPD) to select the learning rate that best regulates the information from the observational data. We validate our method through a simulation study that shows increased power while maintaining an approximate nominal coverage rate. Finally, we apply our method in a real-world data fusion study augmenting the PIONEER 6 clinical trial with a US health claims dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method and providing detailed guidance on how to address practical considerations in its application.</description>

      <title>Copula-like inference for discrete bivariate distributions with rectangular supports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After reviewing a large body of literature on the modeling of bivariate discrete distributions with finite support, \cite{Gee20} made a compelling case for the use of $I$-projections in the sense of \cite{Csi75} as a sound way to attempt to decompose a bivariate probability mass function (p.m.f.) into its two univariate margins and a bivariate p.m.f.\ with uniform margins playing the role of a discrete copula. From a practical perspective, the necessary $I$-projections on Fr\'echet classes can be carried out using the iterative proportional fitting procedure (IPFP), also known as Sinkhorn's algorithm or matrix scaling in the literature. After providing conditions under which a bivariate p.m.f.\ can be decomposed in the aforementioned sense, we investigate, for starting bivariate p.m.f.s with rectangular supports, nonparametric and parametric estimation procedures as well as goodness-of-fit tests for the underlying discrete copula. Related asymptotic results are provided and build upon a differentiability result for $I$-projections on Fr\'echet classes which can be of independent interest. Theoretical results are complemented by finite-sample experiments and a data example.</description>

      <title>covXtreme : MATLAB software for non-stationary penalised piecewise constant marginal and conditional extreme value models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The covXtreme software provides functionality for estimation of marginal and conditional extreme value models, non-stationary with respect to covariates, and environmental design contours. Generalised Pareto (GP) marginal models of peaks over threshold are estimated, using a piecewise-constant representation for the variation of GP threshold and scale parameters on the (potentially multidimensional) covariate domain of interest. The conditional variation of one or more associated variates, given a large value of a single conditioning variate, is described using the conditional extremes model of Heffernan and Tawn (2004), the slope term of which is also assumed to vary in a piecewise constant manner with covariates. Optimal smoothness of marginal and conditional extreme value model parameters with respect to covariates is estimated using cross-validated roughness-penalised maximum likelihood estimation. Uncertainties in model parameter estimates due to marginal and conditional extreme value threshold choice, and sample size, are quantified using a bootstrap resampling scheme. Estimates of environmental contours using various schemes, including the direct sampling approach of Huseby et al. 2013, are calculated by simulation or numerical integration under fitted models. The software was developed in MATLAB for metocean applications, but is applicable generally to multivariate samples of peaks over threshold. The software and case study data can be downloaded from GitHub, with an accompanying user guide.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Screening for Additive Quantile Regression in Ultra-high Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03769</link>

Abstract: In practical applications, one often does not know the "true" structure of the underlying conditional quantile function, especially in the ultra-high dimensional setting. To deal with ultra-high dimensionality, quantile-adaptive marginal nonparametric screening methods have been recently developed. However, these approaches may miss important covariates that are marginally independent of the response, or may select unimportant covariates due to their high correlations with important covariates. To mitigate such shortcomings, we develop a conditional nonparametric quantile screening procedure (complemented by subsequent selection) for nonparametric additive quantile regression models. Under some mild conditions, we show that the proposed screening method can identify all relevant covariates in a small number of steps with probability approaching one. The subsequent narrowed best subset (via a modified Bayesian information criterion) also contains all the relevant covariates with overwhelming probability. The advantages of our proposed procedure are demonstrated through simulation studies and a real data example.</description>

      <title>Sequential Rotations and Error Analysis of a Simple Quaternion Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reference [1] introduces a novel closed-form quaternion estimator from two vector observations. The simplicity of the estimator sometimes yields singular expressions, the current annotation provides the simple rotation schemes for four singular cases. The estimator enables clear physical insights and a closed-form expression for the bias as a function of the quaternion error covariance matrix. The latter could be approximated up to second order with respect to the underlying measurement noise assuming arbitrary probability distribution. This note relaxes the second-order assumption, provides an expression for the error covariance that is exact to the fourth order, and a comprehensive derivation of the individual components of the quaternion additive error covariance matrix, under the assumption of Gaussian distribution. It not only provides increased accuracy but also alleviates issues related to singularity.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes inference in sparse high-dimensional generalized linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional linear models have been widely studied, but the developments in high-dimensional generalized linear models, or GLMs, have been slower. In this paper, we propose an empirical or data-driven prior leading to an empirical Bayes posterior distribution which can be used for estimation of and inference on the coefficient vector in a high-dimensional GLM, as well as for variable selection. We prove that our proposed posterior concentrates around the true/sparse coefficient vector at the optimal rate, provide conditions under which the posterior can achieve variable selection consistency, and prove a Bernstein--von Mises theorem that implies asymptotically valid uncertainty quantification. Computation of the proposed empirical Bayes posterior is simple and efficient, and is shown to perform well in simulations compared to existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods in terms of estimation and variable selection.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity-aware integrative regression for ancestry-specific association studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ancestry-specific proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) based on genetically predicted protein expression can reveal complex disease etiology specific to certain ancestral groups. These studies require ancestry-specific models for protein expression as a function of SNP genotypes. In order to improve protein expression prediction in ancestral populations historically underrepresented in genomic studies, we propose a new penalized maximum likelihood estimator for fitting ancestry-specific joint protein quantitative trait loci models. Our estimator borrows information across ancestral groups, while simultaneously allowing for heterogeneous error variances and regression coefficients. We propose an alternative parameterization of our model which makes the objective function convex and the penalty scale invariant. To improve computational efficiency, we propose an approximate version of our method and study its theoretical properties. Our method provides a substantial improvement in protein expression prediction accuracy in individuals of African ancestry, and in a downstream PWAS analysis, leads to the discovery of multiple associations between protein expression and blood lipid traits in the African ancestry population.</description>

      <title>An adaptive standardisation methodology for Day-Ahead electricity price forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of Day-Ahead prices in the electricity market is one of the most popular problems in time series forecasting. Previous research has focused on employing increasingly complex learning algorithms to capture the sophisticated dynamics of the market. However, there is a threshold where increased complexity fails to yield substantial improvements. In this work, we propose an alternative approach by introducing an adaptive standardisation to mitigate the effects of dataset shifts that commonly occur in the market. By doing so, learning algorithms can prioritize uncovering the true relationship between the target variable and the explanatory variables. We investigate five distinct markets, including two novel datasets, previously unexplored in the literature. These datasets provide a more realistic representation of the current market context, that conventional datasets do not show. The results demonstrate a significant improvement across all five markets using the widely accepted learning algorithms in the literature (LEAR and DNN). In particular, the combination of the proposed methodology with the methodology previously presented in the literature obtains the best results. This significant advancement unveils new lines of research in this field, highlighting the potential of adaptive transformations in enhancing the performance of forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Fused Extended Two-Way Fixed Effects for Difference-in-Differences with Staggered Adoptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the bias of the canonical two-way fixed effects estimator for difference-in-differences under staggered adoptions, Wooldridge (2021) proposed the extended two-way fixed effects estimator, which adds many parameters. However, this reduces efficiency. Restricting some of these parameters to be equal (for example, subsequent treatment effects within a cohort) helps, but ad hoc restrictions may reintroduce bias. We propose a machine learning estimator with a single tuning parameter, fused extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE), that enables automatic data-driven selection of these restrictions. We prove that under an appropriate sparsity assumption FETWFE identifies the correct restrictions with probability tending to one, which improves efficiency. We also prove the consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality of FETWFE for several classes of heterogeneous marginal treatment effect estimators under either conditional or marginal parallel trends, and we prove the same results for conditional average treatment effects under conditional parallel trends. We demonstrate FETWFE in simulation studies and an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Auditing Fairness under Unobserved Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of inequity is a fundamental problem in the outcomes of decision-making systems, especially when human lives are at stake. Yet, estimating notions of unfairness or inequity is difficult, particularly if they rely on hard-to-measure concepts such as risk. Such measurements of risk can be accurately obtained when no unobserved confounders have jointly influenced past decisions and outcomes. However, in the real world, this assumption rarely holds. In this paper, we show a surprising result that one can still give meaningful bounds on treatment rates to high-risk individuals, even when entirely eliminating or relaxing the assumption that all relevant risk factors are observed. We use the fact that in many real-world settings (e.g., the release of a new treatment) we have data from prior to any allocation to derive unbiased estimates of risk. This result is of immediate practical interest: we can audit unfair outcomes of existing decision-making systems in a principled manner. For instance, in a real-world study of Paxlovid allocation, our framework provably identifies that observed racial inequity cannot be explained by unobserved confounders of the same strength as important observed covariates.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional analysis of ridge regression for non-identically distributed data with a variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional linear regression has been thoroughly studied in the context of independent and identically distributed data. We propose to investigate high-dimensional regression models for independent but non-identically distributed data. To this end, we suppose that the set of observed predictors (or features) is a random matrix with a variance profile and with dimensions growing at a proportional rate. Assuming a random effect model, we study the predictive risk of the ridge estimator for linear regression with such a variance profile. In this setting, we provide deterministic equivalents of this risk and of the degree of freedom of the ridge estimator. For certain class of variance profile, our work highlights the emergence of the well-known double descent phenomenon in high-dimensional regression for the minimum norm least-squares estimator when the ridge regularization parameter goes to zero. We also exhibit variance profiles for which the shape of this predictive risk differs from double descent. The proofs of our results are based on tools from random matrix theory in the presence of a variance profile that have not been considered so far to study regression models. Numerical experiments are provided to show the accuracy of the aforementioned deterministic equivalents on the computation of the predictive risk of ridge regression. We also investigate the similarities and differences that exist with the standard setting of independent and identically distributed data.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Clustering with the Distinguishability Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster analysis is a popular unsupervised learning tool used in many disciplines to identify heterogeneous sub-populations within a sample. However, validating cluster analysis results and determining the number of clusters in a data set remains an outstanding problem. In this work, we present a global criterion called the Distinguishability criterion to quantify the separability of identified clusters and validate inferred cluster configurations. Our computational implementation of the Distinguishability criterion corresponds to the Bayes risk of a randomized classifier under the 0-1 loss. We propose a combined loss function-based computational framework that integrates the Distinguishability criterion with many commonly used clustering procedures, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and finite mixture models. We present these new algorithms as well as the results from comprehensive data analysis based on simulation studies and real data applications.</description>
