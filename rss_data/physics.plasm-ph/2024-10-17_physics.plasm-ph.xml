      <title>A Subgrid Model of Electron-Scale Tokamak Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subgrid electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) model is demonstrated here which averages local electron-scale turbulence from the GENE code over intermediate scales in space and time to include in global ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) GEM simulations. This approach results in ion-scale equations which include the electron heat transport from ETG turbulence and the effects of electron-scale turbulence on the ion scale. Flux-tube ETG Cyclone Base Case simulations are carried out using GENE at different radial locations and a kinetic form of the flux is added to ion-scale global GEM simulations as a source term. Analytic radial profiles of ETG heat flux are constructed and compared to flux-tube results at multiple radial locations. Different ratios of ITG to ETG turbulent heat flux levels are considered and the results of capturing ETG heat transport in global GEM simulations are discussed. Possibilities for coupling of the ETG streamer potential and intermediate-scale zonal flows found in ETG simulations to the ion scale are further discussed.</description>

      <title>Exactly energy-momentum-conserving stochastic differential equations and algorithms for nonlinear Landau-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb collision is a fundamental diffusion process in plasmas that can be described by the Landau-Fokker-Planck (LFP) equation or the stochastic differential equation (SDE). While energy and momentum are conserved exactly in the LFP equation, they are conserved only on average by the conventional corresponding SDEs, suggesting that the underlying stochastic process may not be well-defined by such SDEs. In this study, we derive new SDEs with exact energy-momentum conservation for the Coulomb collision by factorizing the collective effect of field particles into individual particles and enforcing Newton's third law. These SDEs, when interpreted in the Stratonovich sense, have a particularly simple form that represents pure diffusion between particles without drag. Numerical algorithms that preserve discrete conservation laws are developed and benchmarked in various relaxation processes. Techniques to reduce computational complexity are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bayesian tomography of ion temperature and velocity for Doppler coherence imaging spectroscopy in RT-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Bayesian tomography approach for Coherence Imaging Spectroscopy (CIS) that simultaneously reconstructs ion temperature and velocity distributions in plasmas. Utilizing nonlinear Gaussian Process Tomography (GPT) with the Laplace approximation, we model prior distributions of log-emissivity, temperature, and velocity as Gaussian processes. This framework rigorously incorporates nonlinear effects and temperature dependencies often neglected in conventional CIS tomography, enabling robust reconstruction even in the region of high temperature and velocity. By applying a log-Gaussian process, we also address issues like velocity divergence in low-emissivity regions. Validated with phantom simulations and experimental data from the RT-1 device, our method reveals detailed spatial structures of ion temperature and toroidal ion flow characteristic of magnetospheric plasma. This work significantly broadens the scope of CIS tomography, offering a robust tool for plasma diagnostics and facilitating integration with complementary measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of divergent and collimated hot electrons via a novel multi-beam two-plasmon decay and stimulated Raman scattering mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions, the preheating risks associated with hot electrons generated by laser plasma instabilities (LPI) are contingent upon the angular characteristics of these hot electrons for a given total energy. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we reveal a novel multi-beam collaborative mechanism of two-plasmon decay (TPD) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and investigate the angular variations of hot electrons generated from this TPD-SRS instability (TSI) driven collectively by dual laser beams with varying incident angles $\theta_{in}$ ($24^{\circ}$ to $55^{\circ}$ at the incident plane) for typical ICF conditions. In the simulations with $\theta_{in}\gtrsim44^{\circ}$, TSI emerges as the dominant mechanism responsible for hot electron generation, leading to a wide angular distribution of hot electrons that exhibit both pronounced divergent and collimated components. The common Langmuir wave associated with TSI plays a crucial role in accelerating both components. By properly modeling the TSI common wave gains, we establish scaling relations between these gains and the energies of collimated and divergent hot electrons. These relations reveal that the divergent hot electrons are more sensitive to variations in gain compared to the collimated electrons. Additionally, the calculated gains qualitatively predict the asymmetry in hot electron angular distributions when the density gradients deviate from the bisector of the laser beams. Our findings offers insights for hot electron generation with multiple beams, potentially complementing previous experiments that underscore the critical role of overlapped intensity from symmetric beams within the same cone and the dominance of dual-beam coupling.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ion Mobility on Electron Density and Temperature in Hypersonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of how ion mobility affects electron density and temperature in hypersonic flows. We compare two ion mobility models: one derived from Gupta-Yos cross-sections, and the other from swarm drift velocity experiments. The ion mobility model significantly alters the plasma density around a hypersonic waverider, with increases of more than twofold observed at low dynamic pressures and high Mach numbers. This is partly due to electron loss through surface catalysis, which depends on ambipolar diffusion scaling with ion mobility. We also derive novel scaling laws that highlight the strong dependence of electron cooling on ion mobility both within the quasi-neutral regions and the non-neutral plasma sheaths. Electron cooling influences the electron temperature across the plasma, leading to a previously unrecognized impact of ion mobility on plasma bulk temperature. This in turn affects plasma density via electron-ion recombination rates which are temperature-dependent. Accurately modeling ion mobility is critical for predicting hypersonic plasma behavior, with important implications for optimizing magnetohydrodynamic technologies and mitigating or exploiting plasma-induced interference with electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Collimated $ \gamma $-flash emission along the target surface irradiated by a laser at non-grazing incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a high-power laser with a solid target provides ways to produce beams of $\gamma$-photons. For normal incidence of the laser on the target the beams usually appear in a form of two lobes, which are symmetric with respect to the laser propagation axis. In this work we demonstrate via three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations a regime where for oblique incidence the emission of a collimated $\gamma$-photon beam is in the direction parallel to the target surface. The process is ascribed to the interference pattern in the electromagnetic field formed by the incident and reflected laser pulse. The electromagnetic field accelerates electrons to the GeV energy level, while temporarily directing their momentum along the target surface. Consequently, they emit a collimated $\gamma$-photon beam in the same direction. The dependencies of $\gamma$-photon emission on the incident angle, laser pulse polarization, power and duration and target thickness are also addressed in the paper. The beam directionality is important for designing future experiments. In addition, this setup causes the generation of high-order harmonics propagating along the target surface.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Eruption and Shrinkage of Pre-existing Flare Loops during a Subsequent Solar Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated two consecutive solar eruption events in the solar active region (AR) 12994 at the solar eastern limb on 2022 April 15. We found that the flare loops formed by the first eruption were involved in the second eruption. During the initial stage of the second flare, the middle part of these flare loops (E-loops) erupted outward along with the flux ropes below, while the parts of the flare loops (I-loops1 and I-loops2) on either side of the E-loops first rose and then contracted. Approximately 1 hour after the eruption, the heights of I-loops1 and I-loops2 decreased by 9 Mm and 45 Mm, respectively, compared to before the eruption. Their maximum descent velocities were 30 km/s and 130 km/s, respectively. The differential emission measure (DEM) results indicate that the plasma above I-loops1 and I-loops2 began to be heated about 23 minutes and 44 minutes after the start of the second flare, respectively. Within 20 minutes, the plasma temperature in these regions increased from ~3 MK to 6 MK. We proposed an adiabatic heating mechanism that magnetic energy would be converted into thermal and kinetic energy when the pre-stretched loops contract. Our calculations show that the magnetic energy required to heat the two high-temperature regions are 10^29-10^30 erg, which correspond to a loss of field strength of 2-3 G.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT observations of pair-plasma induced birefringence in the double pulsar eclipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PSR J0737$-$3039A/B is unique among double neutron star systems. Its near-perfect edge-on orbit causes the fast spinning pulsar A to be eclipsed by the magnetic field of the slow spinning pulsar B. Using high-sensitivity MeerKAT radio observations combined with updated constraints on the system geometry, we studied the impact of these eclipses on the incident polarization properties of pulsar A. Averaging light curves together after correcting for the rotation of pulsar B revealed enormous amounts of circular polarization and rapid changes in the linear polarization position angle, which occur at phases where emission from pulsar A is partially transmitted through the magnetosphere of pulsar B. These behaviours confirm that the eclipse mechanism is the result of synchrotron absorption in a relativistic pair-plasma confined to the closed-field region of pulsar B's truncated dipolar magnetic field. We demonstrate that changes in circular polarization handedness throughout the eclipses are directly tied to the average line of sight magnetic field direction of pulsar B, from which we unambiguously determine the complete magnetic and viewing geometry of the pulsar.</description>

      <title>Generative Neural Reparameterization for Differentiable PDE-constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial-differential-equation (PDE)-constrained optimization is a well-worn technique for acquiring optimal parameters of systems governed by PDEs. However, this approach is limited to providing a single set of optimal parameters per optimization. Given a differentiable PDE solver, if the free parameters are reparameterized as the output of a neural network, that neural network can be trained to learn a map from a probability distribution to the distribution of optimal parameters. This proves useful in the case where there are many well performing local minima for the PDE. We apply this technique to train a neural network that generates optimal parameters that minimize laser-plasma instabilities relevant to laser fusion and show that the neural network generates many well performing and diverse minima.</description>

      <title>Small-Signal Model for Inhomogeneous Helix Traveling-Wave Tubes using Transfer Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract We introduce a practical method for modeling the small-signal behavior of frequency-dispersive and inhomogeneous helix-type traveling-wave tube (TWT) amplifiers based on a generalization of the one-dimensional Pierce model. Our model is applicable to both single-stage and multi-stage TWTs. Like the Pierce model, we assume that electrons flow linearly in one direction, parallel and in proximity to a slow-wave structure (SWS) which guides a single dominant electromagnetic mode. Realistic helix TWTs are modeled with position-dependent and frequency-dependent SWS characteristics, such as loss, phase velocity, plasma frequency reduction factor, interaction impedance, and the coupling factor that relates the SWS modal characteristic impedance to the interaction impedance. For the multi-stage helix TWT, we provide a simple lumped element circuit model for combining the stages separated by a sever, or gap, which attenuates the guided circuit mode while allowing the space-charge wave on the beam to pass freely to the next stage. The dispersive SWS characteristics are accounted for using full-wave eigenmode simulations for a realistic helix SWS supported by dielectric rods in a metal barrel, all of which contribute to the distributed circuit loss. We compare our computed gain vs frequency, computed using transfer matrices, to results found through particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and the 1D TWT code LATTE to demonstrate the accuracy of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our model to reproduce gain ripple due to mismatches at the input and output ports of the TWT.</description>

      <title>Turbulent magnetic decay controlled by two conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of a turbulent magnetic field is slower with helicity than without. Furthermore, the magnetic correlation length grows faster for a helical than a nonhelical field. Both helical and nonhelical decay laws involve conserved quantities: the mean magnetic helicity density and the Hosking integral. Using direct numerical simulations in a triply periodic domain, we show quantitatively that in the fractionally helical case the mean magnetic energy density and correlation length are approximately given by the maximum of the values for the purely helical and purely nonhelical cases. The time of switch-over from one to the other decay law can be obtained on dimensional grounds and is approximately given by $I_\mathrm{H}^{1/2}I_\mathrm{M}^{-3/2}$, where $I_\mathrm{H}$ is the Hosking integral and $I_\mathrm{M}$ is the mean magnetic helicity density. An earlier approach based on the decay time is found to agree with our new result and suggests that the Hosking integral exceeds naive estimates by the square of the same resistivity-dependent factor by which also the turbulent decay time exceeds the Alfv\'en time. In the presence of an applied magnetic field, the mean magnetic helicity density is known to be not conserved, and we show that then also the Hosking integral is not conserved.</description>

      <title>A transformational approach to collective behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a revolutionary approach to the characterization, forecast, and control of collective systems. Collective systems are an ensemble of conservatively interacting entities. The evolution of the entities are determined by symmetries of the entities. Collective systems take many different forms. A plasma is a collective of charged particles, a fluid is a collective of molecules, a elementary field is a collective of elementary particles, and a cosmos is a collective of celestial bodies. Our new theory builds on the canonical transformation approach to dynamics. This approach recognizes that the symmetry leads to the conservation of a real function, that is the infinitesimal generator of a Lie group. The finite generator of the canonical transformation is derived from the infinitesimal generator by the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This generating function is also known as the action, the entropy, and the logarithmic likelihood. The new theory generalizes this generating function to the generating functional of the collective field. Finally, this paper derives the formula for the Mayer Cluster Expansion, or the S-matrix expansion of the generating functional. We call it the Heisenberg Scattering Transformation (HST). Practically, this is a localized Fourier Transformation, whose principal components give the singularity spectrums, that is the solution to the Renormalization Group Equations. Limitations on the measurement of the system (that is the Born Rule and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) lead to quantization of the stochastic probabilities of the collective field. How different collective systems couple together to form systems-of-systems is formalized. The details of a practical implementation of the HST will be presented.</description>
