      <title>Cross-Fitting-Free Debiased Machine Learning with Multiway Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an asymptotic theory for two-step debiased machine learning (DML) estimators in generalised method of moments (GMM) models with general multiway clustered dependence, without relying on cross-fitting. While cross-fitting is commonly employed, it can be statistically inefficient and computationally burdensome when first-stage learners are complex and the effective sample size is governed by the number of independent clusters. We show that valid inference can be achieved without sample splitting by combining Neyman-orthogonal moment conditions with a localisation-based empirical process approach, allowing for an arbitrary number of clustering dimensions. The resulting DML-GMM estimators are shown to be asymptotically linear and asymptotically normal under multiway clustered dependence. A central technical contribution of the paper is the derivation of novel global and local maximal inequalities for general classes of functions of sums of separately exchangeable arrays, which underpin our theoretical arguments and are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Spillover Effects Under Misspecification:Pseudo-true Estimands and a Local--Global Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applied work with interference typically models outcomes as functions of own treatment and a low-dimensional exposure mapping of others' treatments, even when that mapping may be misspecified. This raises a basic question: what policy object are exposure-based estimands implicitly targeting, and how should we interpret their direct and spillover components relative to the underlying policy question? We take as primitive the marginal policy effect, defined as the effect of a small change in the treatment probability under the actual experimental design, and show that any researcher-chosen exposure mapping induces a unique pseudo-true outcome model. This model is the best approximation to the underlying potential outcomes that depends only on the user-chosen exposure. Utilizing that representation, the marginal policy effect admits a canonical decomposition into exposure-based direct and spillover effects, and each component provides its optimal approximation to the corresponding oracle objects that would be available if interference were fully known. We then focus on a setting that nests important empirical and theoretical applications in which both local network spillovers and global spillovers, such as market equilibrium, operate. There, the marginal policy effect further decomposes asymptotically into direct, local, and global channels. An important implication is that many existing methods are more robust than previously understood once we reinterpret their targets as channel-specific components of this pseudo-true policy estimand. Simulations and a semi-synthetic experiment calibrated to a large cash-transfer experiment show that these components can be recovered in realistic experimental designs.</description>

      <title>Improved Inference for CSDID Using the Cluster Jackknife</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining reliable inferences with traditional difference-in-differences (DiD) methods can be difficult. Problems can arise when both outcomes and errors are serially correlated, when there are few clusters or few treated clusters, when cluster sizes vary greatly, and in various other cases. In recent years, recognition of the ``staggered adoption'' problem has shifted the focus away from inference towards consistent estimation of treatment effects. One of the most popular new estimators is the CSDID procedure of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021). We find that the issues of over-rejection with few clusters and/or few treated clusters are at least as severe for CSDID as for traditional DiD methods. We also propose using a cluster jackknife for inference with CSDID, which simulations suggest greatly improves inference. We provide software packages in Stata csdidjack and R didjack to calculate cluster-jackknife standard errors easily.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Effect of Persuasion with Monotonicity Assumptions: Reassessing the Impact of TV Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Televised debates between presidential candidates are often regarded as the exemplar of persuasive communication. Yet, recent evidence from Le Pennec and Pons (2023) indicates that they may not sway voters as strongly as popular belief suggests. We revisit their findings through the lens of the persuasion rate and introduce a robust framework that does not require exogenous treatment, parallel trends, or credible instruments. Instead, we leverage plausible monotonicity assumptions to partially identify the persuasion rate and related parameters. Our results reaffirm that the sharp upper bounds on the persuasive effects of TV debates remain modest.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Estimation in Heterogeneous Coefficient Panel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an empirical Bayes (EB) G-modeling framework for short-panel linear models with nonparametric prior for the random intercepts, slopes, dynamics, and non-spherical error variances. We establish identification and consistency of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) under general conditions, and provide low-level sufficient conditions for several models of empirical interest. Conditions for regret consistency of the EB estimators are also established. The NPMLE is computed using a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow algorithm adapted to panel regressions. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that the slope coefficient for potential experience is substantially heterogeneous and negatively correlated with the random intercept, and that error variances and autoregressive coefficients vary significantly across individuals. The EB estimates reduce mean squared prediction errors relative to individual maximum likelihood estimates.</description>

      <title>Quantile optimization in semidiscrete optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport is the problem of designing a joint distribution for two random variables with fixed marginals. In virtually the entire literature on this topic, the objective is to minimize expected cost. This paper is the first to study a variant in which the goal is to minimize a quantile of the cost, rather than the mean. For the semidiscrete setting, where one distribution is continuous and the other is discrete, we derive a complete characterization of the optimal transport plan and develop simulation-based methods to efficiently compute it. One particularly novel aspect of our approach is the efficient computation of a tie-breaking rule that preserves marginal distributions. In the context of geographical partitioning problems, the optimal plan is shown to produce a novel geometric structure.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Two-Stage Gradient Descent for Instrumental Variable Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression (IVaR) under differential privacy constraints. Classical IVaR methods (like two-stage least squares regression) rely on solving moment equations that directly use sensitive covariates and instruments, creating significant risks of privacy leakage and posing challenges in designing algorithms that are both statistically efficient and differentially private. We propose a noisy two-state gradient descent algorithm that ensures $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy by injecting carefully calibrated noise into the gradient updates. Our analysis establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the proposed method, showing that the algorithm achieves consistency while preserving privacy. In particular, we derive precise bounds quantifying the trade-off among optimization, privacy, and sampling error. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide both privacy guarantees and provable convergence rates for instrumental variable regression in linear models. We further validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method offers practical accuracy-privacy trade-offs.</description>
