      <title>Complete electronic phase diagram and enhanced superconductivity in fluorine-doped PrFeAsO1-xFx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing a complete electronic phase diagram for REFeAsO (RE = rare earth, RE1111) ironbased superconductors has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we report a systematic investigation of PrFeAsO1-xFx over the full nominal fluorine-doping range 0 to 1 and construct the first comprehensive electronic phase diagram for this system. The evolution from the nonsuperconducting parent compound to the fluorine-rich limit reveals a broad dome shaped superconducting region. Structural refinement demonstrates a systematic lattice contraction with increasing fluorine content (x), corroborated by Raman spectroscopy through softening of the Pr(A1g) phonon mode and hardening of the Fe(B1g) mode, confirming effective fluorine incorporation at the oxygen sites. The maximum superconducting transition temperature (Tc) reaches up to 52.3 K, approximately 5 K higher than previous reports for Pr1111. Magnetotransport measurements yield large upper critical fields Hc2(0) exceeding 100 T, while analysis of resistive transition broadening reveals thermally activated flux flow with a crossover from single-vortex to collective pinning regimes. Specific-heat measurements exhibit a reduced jump deltaC/{\gamma}Tc &lt; 1.43, reflecting strong superconducting fluctuations and multiband pairing. These results establish clear structure property correlations and provide a unified description of superconductivity across the entire doping range of the Pr1111 system.</description>

      <title>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</description>

      <title>Topological and Planar Hall Effect in Monoclinic van der Waals Ferromagnet NbFeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as a critical class of quantum materials for next-generation, low-dimensional spintronic devices. In this study, we report a comprehensive study of the transport properties of the layered soft ferromagnet $\text{NbFeTe}_2$. We report the first observation of the topological Hall effect (THE) and the planar Hall effect (PHE) in metallic $\text{NbFeTe}_2$. THE signatures persist up to 45 K, while PHE remains evident well above Curie temperature ($T_C$). The observed negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, along with the PHE, provides strong evidence for a nontrivial electronic band structure. The coexistence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and a substantial THE: two key properties that are highly desirable for future spintronics applications, makes monoclinic vdW ferromagnetic $\text{NbFeTe}_2$ a promising platform to advance spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of metal encapsulation on bulk superconducting properties of niobium thin films used in qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium metal occupies nearly 100\% of the volume of a typical 2D transmon device. While the aluminum Josephson junction is of utmost importance, maintaining quantum coherence across the entire device means that pair-breaking in Nb leads, capacitive pads, and readout resonators can be a major source of decoherence. The established contributors are surface oxides and hydroxides, as well as absorbed hydrogen and oxygen. Metal encapsulation of freshly grown surfaces with non-oxidizing metals, preferably without breaking the vacuum, is a successful strategy to mitigate these issues. While the positive effects of encapsulation are undeniable, it is important to understand its impact on the macroscopic behavior of niobium films. We present a comprehensive study of the bulk superconducting properties of Nb thin films encapsulated with gold and palladium/gold, and compare them to those of bare Nb films. Magneto-optical imaging, magnetization, resistivity, and London and Campbell penetration depth measurements reveal significant differences in encapsulated samples. Both sputtered, and epitaxial Au-capped films exhibit the highest residual resistivity ratio and superconducting transition temperature, as well as the lowest upper critical field, London penetration depth, and critical current. These results are in good agreement with the microscopic theory of anisotropic normal and superconducting states of Nb. We conclude that pair-breaking in the bulk of niobium films, driven by disorder throughout the film rather than just at the surface, is a significant source of quantum decoherence in transmons. We also conclude that gold capping not only passivates the surface but also affects the properties of the entire film, significantly reducing the scattering rate due to defects likely induced by surface diffusion if the film is not protected immediately after fabrication.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations and Superconductivity in La2SmNi2O7 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity is fundamental for understanding unconventional high-temperature superconductors. In the recently discovered Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates-which achieve superconducting transition temperatures up to ~100 K-this connection has been theoretically predicted but experimentally unverified. Using compressively strained La2SmNi2O7 thin films, we report direct evidence for this interplay. We observe a characteristic 'Mexican hat'-shaped magnetoresistance, a signature of superconductivity coexisting with emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations. This distinctive feature arises from a competition between the magnetic field's suppression of AFM fluctuation-driven scattering and its suppression of superconducting fluctuations. We quantify these AFM fluctuations by a crossover field, B*, whose magnitude decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes near the superconducting onset-behavior contrasting sharply with that in high-Tc cuprates. Our results establish not merely coexistence, but also a direct and novel correlation between AFM instability and superconductivity in nickelates, offering crucial insight into their pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Electronic Correlations in the Spin Density Wave State of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ undergoes a density wave transition near 150 K that has attracted intensive scrutiny, yet its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here we report polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering measurements on high-quality single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Below 150\,K, we observe a pronounced, symmetry-dependent redistribution of spectral weight in B$_{1g}$ and B$_{2g}$ channels, consistent with the formation of spin-density-wave (SDW) gaps. Quantitative analysis reveals momentum-selective SDW gap amplitudes, with intermediate-to-strong coupling near X/Y points of the Brillouin zone and weaker coupling along the diagonal direction, indicating an unconventional SDW driven by anisotropic electronic correlations. Our results establish the electronic character of the SDW in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, and provide a microscopic foundation for understanding the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity under pressure in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Investigation of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ order parameters via ultrasound propagation anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors with nearly degenerate pairing states are rare. CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has recently emerged as one of the few existing multi-phase superconductors. It exhibits a first-order phase transition between two distinct superconducting states when a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic $c$-axis. While this behavior has been linked to locally broken inversion symmetry, a phase diagram based on a multi-component superconducting order parameter remains a possibility. Furthermore, superconductivity appears to coexist with an ordered state (phase I). Despite being the subject of many studies, little is known about the nature of the order parameters in both superconducting phases and phase I. Here, we use ultrasound-propagation measurements at low temperatures, in high magnetic fields and under hydrostatic pressure to address this issue. Our results strongly suggest that the superconducting order parameter in both phases is single-component, corroborating the role of local non-centrosymmetry in the development of multi-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. In addition, analysis of the elastic anomalies within the Landau framework of phase transitions strongly suggests the presence of an incommensurate magnetic order parameter in phase I.</description>

      <title>Intimate relationship between spin configuration in the triplet pair and superconductivity in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-triplet superconductivity is an intriguing quantum coherent state with both spin and orbital degrees of freedom, which holds significant potential for future applications in quantum technology. However, how the spin of the triplet pairs responds to an external magnetic field remains poorly understood. This is mainly due to the absence of suitable spin-triplet superconductors. Here, we report results of Knight-shift and ac-susceptibility measurements on UTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the spin susceptibility, which slightly decreases compared to the normal-state value below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, is rapidly restored and nearly recovers to the normal-state values around 5 T, well below the SC upper critical field $H_{c2}$ when the magnetic field is applied along the $c$ axis ($H \parallel c$). In addition, we found that $H_{\rm c2}$ of superconductivity becomes larger when the SC spin aligns with the magnetic field. By considering the results on $H \parallel b$, our results suggest the presence of a close relationship between the spin configuration of the triplet pair and $H_{\rm c2}$, as well as the anisotropic pinning interaction acting on the triplet pairs. These phenomena, which have never been observed in spin-singlet superconductors, represent characteristic features unique to spin-triplet superconductors. We discuss the similarities between superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and superfluid $^3$He, focusing on their spin-triplet pairing states.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of spin block magnetic ladders in proximity of a superconductor: application to BaFe$_{2}$S$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoatomic chains with magnetic order in proximity of a s-wave superconductor can host Majorana edge modes. In this paper, we extend this idea to more complex spin-block chains such as the BaFe$_{2}$S$_{3}$ magnetic material that has a spin-ladder like structure. We investigate the topological phase diagram of such a system as function of the system parameters. We show that the coupling between chains within the ladder leads to the topological phase with a winding number larger than the sum of two single magnetic chains. Furthermore, strong coupling between chains leads to fractal-like substructure in the topological phase diagram. By investigating the real space properties of such a system and particularly its edge modes, we find that the system spectrum contains several in-gap states that we analyze in detail.</description>

      <title>Josephson tunneling through a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state: Interplay of $\pi$-shifts in Josephson current and local superconducting order parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An impurity hosting a magnetic moment coupled to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor gives rise to so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states with energies inside the superconducting gap. Depending on the coupling between the impurity and the superconductor, the system can have two distinct quantum ground states separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We investigate the interplay of two effects observed at the QPT. First, the tunneling supercurrent through the impurity reverses its sign at the QPT, denoted as a $\pi$-shift in the current-phase relation. Secondly, the local superconducting order parameter at the impurity site is suppressed and becomes negative at the QPT, generally termed a $\pi$-shift in the local superconducting order parameter. We find that both these effects are governed by the presence of the YSR state, however, they do not significantly depend or influence each other. In particular, we establish that the $\pi$-shift in the superconducting order parameter does not induce a $\pi$-shift in the tunneling Josephson current, nor can the Josephson current and its spatial behavior be used to directly probe the impurity-induced changes in the local superconducting order parameter, which occur on a length scale substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length.</description>

Abstract: While superconductors are highly attractive for energy-efficient computing, fundamental limitations in their logic circuit integration have hindered scaling and led to increased energy consumption. We therefore propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel superconducting switching device utilizing the proximity magnetization from a spin-orbit torque-switched magnet to control the resistivity of a superconductor. We further propose a complete logic family comprised solely of these devices. This novel implementation has the potential to drastically outperform existing superconducting logic families in terms of energy efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity on a kagome magnet coupled to a Rashba superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum anomalous Hall system is predicted to realize topological superconductivity when proximity-coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor. A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator. We also show that the magnetic ordering of kagome magnets is affected energetically by the proximity effect.</description>

      <title>First-principles study on the high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity of Mg-Ti-H ternary hydrides up to the liquid-nitrogen temperature range under high pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ternary hydrides have emerged as the primary focus of the new wave of research into superconducting hydrides. In this work, Mg-Ti-H ternary hydrides are explored under high pressures up to 300 GPa using the prediction method of the particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with first-principles calculations. Two new structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pmm2$-Mg$_3$TiH$_6$, are identified to be thermodynamically stable at both 200 GPa and 300 GPa. Thermodynamically stable structures of Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ are also identified, whose space groups are $R3/m$ at 200 GPa and $Pm\bar{3}m$ at 300 GPa, respectively. Among these Mg-Ti-H structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ achieves a record-high $T_\text{c}$ of 81.9 K at 170 GPa, exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Such a high $T_\text{c}$ is primarily attributed to strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) driven by low-frequency acoustic phonon modes, with the EPC strength reaching a large value of 1.54. The $T_\text{c}$ of $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ is predicted to be 40 K at 300 GPa. Furthermore, element substitution of Zr(Hf) for Ti achieves considerable enhancement of superconducting properties in our predicted hydrogen-rich and high-symmetric crystal structures, i.e., $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$. The high pressure required for dynamical stability is lowered to 100 GPa in both $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$ZrH$_{12}$ and $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$HfH$_{12}$, and to 90 GPa and 120 GPa for $P4/nmm$-MgZrH$_6$ and $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$, respectively. Particularly, the electronic structure near the Fermi level is significantly modified in the $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$ phase, and pronounced softening of low-frequency acoustic phonon modes occurs. As a result, the EPC strength is enhanced to 1.72, leading to a higher $T_\text{c}$ of 86 K.</description>

      <title>Mutual Inductance Sensing SQUID: Cryogenic microcalorimeter based on mutual inductance readout of superconducting temperature sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting microcalorimeters, such as superconducting transition-edge sensors and magnetic microcalorimeters, have emerged as state-of-the-art detectors for x-ray emission spectroscopy by combining near-unity quantum efficiency with excellent energy resolution. Despite these achievements, their resolving power has not yet reached the level required to rival modern wavelength-dispersive grating or crystal spectrometers. Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode and spin-valve effects on the surface of altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate charge transport in In-CrSb and In-CrSb-In proximity devices, which are formed as junctions between superconducting indium leads and thick single crystal flakes of altermagnet CrSb. For double In-CrSb-In junctions, the obtained $dV/dI(B)$ curves are mirrored in respect to zero field for two magnetic field sweep directions, which is characteristic behavior of a Josephson spin valve. Also, we demonstrate Josephson diode effect by direct measurement of the critical current for two opposite directions in external magnetic field. We interpret these observations as a joint effect of the spin-polarized topological surface states and the altermagnetic spin splitting of the bulk bands in CrSb. For a single In-CrSb interface, the superconducting gap oscillates in magnetic field for both field orientations, which strongly resembles the transition into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The latter is based on finite-momentum Cooper pairing against a background of the Zeeman splitting, so it is fully compatible with the requirements for the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed microwave resonators by frequency comb spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coplanar waveguide resonators are central to the thriving field of circuit quantum electrodynamics. Recently, we have demonstrated the generation of a broadband microwave-frequency comb spectrum using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. Here, the frequency comb is used to spectroscopically probe a bank of coplanar microwave resonators, inductively coupled to a common transmission line, a standard circuit with a variety of applications. We compare the resonator line shape obtained from signals synthesized at room temperature using conventional electronics with the radiation produced in the cryogenic environment by our source, showing substantial equivalence in the estimation of the resonator quality factors. To measure non-uniformly spaced resonant frequencies, we drive the generator with a bi-chromatic tone to generate intermodulation products. Such a dense frequency comb spectrum enables simultaneous addressing of a few resonators via frequency multiplexing. Finally, we discuss the criteria for achieving effective spectroscopic coverage of a given frequency bandwidth.</description>

      <title>W-SLDA Toolkit: A simulation platform for ultracold Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the W-SLDA Toolkit, a general-purpose software package for simulating ultracold Fermi gases within the framework of density functional theory and its time-dependent extensions. The toolkit enables fully microscopic studies of interacting superfluid systems across the BCS-BEC crossover, including spin-imbalanced configurations and arbitrary external geometries. It provides both static and time-dependent solvers capable of describing a broad range of phenomena in one-, two-, and three-dimensional settings. In addition, the toolkit incorporates functionality for solving the standard Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for fermions, extending its applicability to other physical systems such as superconductors. The code is implemented in C with GPU acceleration and is optimized for hybrid CPU/GPU execution on modern high-performance computing platforms. It ensures scalability on leadership-class supercomputers, enabling fully three-dimensional simulations with large atomic numbers, and allows for direct benchmarks of ultracold-atom experimental setups. Its modular architecture facilitates straightforward extensions, user customization, and seamless interoperability with other scientific software frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive collection of practical usage examples is provided through the integrated reproducibility packs functionality, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of computational results.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid transport beyond the upper critical field in superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity typically emerges out of a strongly correlated normal state, manifesting as a highly renormalized Fermi liquid or a strange metal with $T$-linear resistivity. In Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates, superconductivity with a critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ exceeding 80 and 40~K has been respectively realised in pressurized bulk crystals and epitaxially strained thin films. These advancements call for the characterisation of fundamental normal-state and superconducting parameters in these new materials platforms of high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. Here we report detailed magnetotransport experiments on superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ (LPNO) thin films under pulsed magnetic fields up to 64~T and access the normal-state behaviour over a wide temperature range between 1.5 and 300~K. We find that the normal state of thin-film LPNO exhibits the hallmarks of Fermi-liquid transport, including $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and $H^2$ magnetoresistance obeying Kohler scaling. Using the empirical Kadowaki-Woods ratio, we estimate a quasiparticle effective mass $m^*/m_e \simeq 10$, thereby revealing the highly renormalized Fermi liquid state therein. Our results demonstrate that thin-film LPNO follows the same $T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm F}$ scaling observed across a myriad of strongly correlated superconductors and establish key normal-state characteristics of strained bilayer superconducting nickelates.</description>

Abstract: Nanometer-scale surface chemistry limits the performance of SRF cavities and quantum circuits. We present an ab initio framework connecting DFT interfacial energetics with strong-coupling Eliashberg theory for capped Nb and Ta surfaces. This approach identifies Au and Au-based alloys (AuPd, AuPt) as effective passivation layers. Our model further predicts that combining a noble-metal capping layer with an appropriate wetting/adhesion layer (WAL) yields far more robust adhesion than a capping layer alone under realistic conditions, enabling thinner caps, and thereby addressing a central challenge in superconducting surface passivation.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Structural and Defect Properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Tc in Oxide Superconductors: Double-Bridge Mechanism of High-Tc Superconductivity and Bose-Einstein Condensation of Cooper Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cuprate Hg0.8Tl0.2Ba2Ca2Cu3O8.33 exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc of 138K. Achieving superconductivity at even higher temperatures, up to room temperature, represents the ultimate dream of humanity. As temperature increases, Cooper pairs formed through weak electron-phonon coupling will be disintegrated by the thermal motion of electrons, severely limiting the enhancement of Tc. It is imperative to explore new strong-coupling pairing pictures and establish novel condensation mechanism of Cooper pairs at higher temperature. Based on our recently proposed groundbreaking idea of electron e- (hole h+) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, namely, the eV-scale ionic-bond-driven atom-bridge (bridge-I) e--O-e- (h+-M-h+) strong-coupling itinerant Cooper pairing formed at pseudogap temperature T*&gt;Tc in ionic oxide superconductors, we further discover that there is an attractive interaction between two Cooper pairs induced by the bridge atom (bridge-II) located between them. It is this attraction mediated by the bridge-II atoms that promotes all the Cooper pairs within the CuO2 plane to hold together and enter the superconducting state at Tc finally. Moreover, according to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory, we find that Tc is inversely proportional to the effective mass m* of Cooper pairs, directly proportional to n2/3s (ns: the density of Cooper pairs), and linearly increases with the scattering length a&lt;0 due to attraction between two Cooper pairs. Therefore, according to our double-bridge mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, increasing the attraction between Cooper pair and bridge-II atom, ensuring that ns takes the optimal value, and minimizing the effective mass of the Cooper pairs are the main approaches to enhancing Tc of ionic-bonded superconductors, which opens up a new avenue with clear direction for designing higher Tc superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrays of Josephson junctions can be tuned through anomalous metallic, quantum-critical, and insulating regimes. We introduce a new experimental probe, capturing microwave radiation across all three regimes, using a two-dimensional array of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junctions as a model system. Our approach allows in-situ calibration of the sample's circuit parameters and provides isolation from measurement back-action effects. We measure the radiation temperature of the anomalous metal, and find that it is hotter than both the quantum-critical and insulating regimes. We further show that the anomalous-metallic regime is more susceptible to additional heating than other regimes, explaining its emergence in otherwise thermalized systems. Turning to the quantum-critical regime, we discover nonlinear scaling of radiative noise with applied bias, consistent with theoretical predictions of universal non-equilibrium behavior at quantum critical points.</description>

Abstract: Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-1 chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we identify a manifold consisting of the two lowest-lying, spin-singlet states isolated from doublet states of opposite fermion parity, which undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random Zeeman and/or spin-orbit coupling. Despite the unavoidable effect of quasiparticle poisoning on qubit performance, the isolation of the singlet states offers additional protection. In addition, we introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</description>
