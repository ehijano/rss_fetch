      <title>On the compactness of bi-parameter singular integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new $T1$ theorem for the compactness of bi-parameter Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integral operators. Namely, we show that if a bi-parameter CZO $T$ satisfies the product weak compactness property, the mixed weak compactness/CMO property, and $T1, T^t1,$ $T_t1, T_t^t1 \in \text{CMO}(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$, then $T$ is compact on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$. We also obtain endpoint compactness results for these operators and use them to deduce the necessity of most of our hypotheses. In particular, our conditions characterize the simultaneous $L^2(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$-compactness of a bi-parameter CZO and its partial transpose. Our assumptions improve upon previously known sufficient conditions, and our proof, which is shorter and simpler than earlier arguments, utilizes a new abstract compactness criterion for partially localized operators on tensor products of Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Gaussian-stability for Brascamp--Lieb Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a stable form of the general Euclidean Brascamp-Lieb inequality in all cases in which the Lebesgue exponents are strictly between 1 and 2, asserting that all near-extremizers are nearly Gaussian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present two different problems within the framework of shift-invariant theory. First, we develop a triangular form for shift-preserving operators acting on finitely generated shift-invariant spaces. In case of the normal operators, we recover a diagonal decomposition. The results show, in particular, that any finitely generated shift-invariant space can be decomposed into an orthogonal sum of principal shift-invariant spaces, with additional invariance properties under a shift-preserving operator. Second, we provide a new characterization of the multi-tiling sets $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ of positive measure for which $L^2(\Omega)$ admits a structured Riesz basis of exponentials that is formulated in the ambient space $\mathbb{T}^{k\times k}$. In addition, we show a simpler sufficient condition which generalizes the admissibility property, that is also necessary for 2-tiling sets.</description>

      <title>The Assouad spectrum and dimension of typical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Assouad spectrum and dimension of graphs of functions lying in certain Banach spaces. We find the typical values in the sense of Baire category, proving that these values are often as large as possible, given the constraints of the particular function space. For example, we demonstrate that in the little $\alpha$-H\"older spaces, a typical graph has Assouad dimension $2$ and Assouad spectrum $\min\{2,2-\frac{\alpha-\theta}{1-\theta}\}$; whereas in the space associated with modulus of continuity $t(1+|\log t|)$, a typical graph has Assouad dimension $2$ but quasi-Assouad dimension (and Assouad spectrum) equal to $1$.</description>

      <title>On a class of Cauchy problems with applications in nonlinear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and nonexistence of entire solutions to a general class of Cauchy problems in the positive half line. Our results provide a unified approach to proving sharp local and entire solvability of nonlinear partial differential equations in n-dimensional Euclidean space. As applications of the general framework, we present such results for two series of nonlinear equations: a series of k-Hessian type equations and a new series of P-k-Hessian type equations. These results are also proved for the more general p-Hessian matrices, with p &gt; 1, and degenerate non homogeneous terms.</description>

      <title>Fourier restriction for the additive Brownian sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fourier restriction problem asks when it is meaningful to restrict the Fourier transform of a function to a given set. Many of the key examples are smooth co-dimension 1 manifolds, although there is increasing interest in fractal sets. Here we propose a natural intermediary problem where one considers the fractal surface generated by the graph of the additive Brownian sheet in $\mathbb{R}^k$. We obtain the first non-trivial estimates in this direction, giving both a sufficient condition on the range of $q\in[1,2]$ for the Fourier transform to be $L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{k+1})\to L^2(G(W))$ bounded and a necessary condition for it to be $L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{k+1})\to L^p(G(W))$ bounded. The sufficient condition is obtained via the Fourier spectrum, which is a family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. Our main technical result, which is of interest in its own right, gives a precise formula for the Fourier spectrum of the natural measure on the graph of the additive Brownian sheet, and we apply this result to the Fourier restriction problem. Our restriction estimate is stronger than the estimate obtained from the well-known Stein--Tomas restriction theorem for all $k\geq3$. We obtain the necessary condition in two different ways, one via the Fourier spectrum and one via an appropriate Knapp example.</description>

      <title>A Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem for Bebutov shifts and applications to switched systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem for certain classes of curves on the 2-sphere which are not required to be the trajectories of an underlying flow or semiflow on the sphere itself. Using this result we extend the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem to the context of continuous semiflows on compact subsets of the 2-sphere and the projective plane, give new sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic trajectories of certain low-dimensional affine control systems, and give a new criterion for the global uniform exponential stability of switched systems of homogeneous ODEs in dimension three. We prove in particular that periodic asymptotic stability implies global uniform exponential stability for real linear switched systems of dimension three and complex linear switched systems of dimension two. In combination with a recent result of the second author, this resolves a question of R. Shorten, F. Wirth, O. Mason, K. Wulff and C. King and resolves a natural analogue of the Lagarias-Wang finiteness conjecture in continuous time.</description>

      <title>On an integrable 2+1-dimensional extended Dym equation: Lax pair, $\bar{\partial}$-dressing scheme and modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1+1-dimensions, an extension of the canonical solitonic Dym equation has previously been derived both in a geometric torsion evolution context and in the analysis of peakon solitonic phenomena in hydrodynamics. Here, a novel 2+1-dimensional S-integrable extended Dym-type equation is introduced. As Lax pair is constructed and an associated $\bar{\partial}$-dressing scheme detailed. Integrable modulated versions of the 2+1-dimensional extended Dym equation are generated via application of a class of involutory transformations with genesis in classical Ermakov theory.</description>

      <title>Generic measures with slowly decaying Fourier coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate threshold phenomena in weighted $\ell^2$-spaces and characterize the critical regimes where elements with either small support or maximally bad range can be constructed. Our results are shown to be optimal in several respects, and our proofs principally rely on techniques involving sparse Fourier spectrum. We further show that these seemingly pathological constructions are actually generic from certain categorical perspectives.</description>
