      <title>Reducibility points and characteristic $p$ local fields I- Simple supercuspidal representations of symplectic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-Archimedean local field with odd characteristic $p$. Let $N$ be a positive integer and $G=Sp_{2N}(F)$. By work of Lomel\'i on $\gamma$-factors of pairs and converse theorems, a generic supercuspidal representation $\pi$ of $G$ has a transfer to a smooth irreducible representation $\Pi_\pi$ of $GL_{2N+1}(F)$. In turn the Weil-Deligne representation $\Sigma_\pi$ associated to $\Pi_\pi$ by the Langlands correspondence determines a Langlands parameter $\phi_\pi$ for $\pi$. That process produces a Langlands correspondence for generic cuspidal representations of $G$.
  In this paper we take $\pi$ to be simple in the sense of Gross and Reeder, and from the explicit construction of $\pi$ we describe $\Pi_\pi$ explicitly. The method we use is the same as in our previous paper arXiv:2310.20455, where we treated the case where $F$ is a $p$-adic field, and $\pi$ a simple supercuspidal representation of $G=Sp_{2N}(F)$. It relies on a criterion due to Moeglin on the reducibility of representations parabolically induced from $GL_M(F)\times G$ for varying positive integers $M$. We extend this criterion to the case when $F$ has any positive characteristic. The main new feature consists in relating reducibility to $\gamma$-factors for pairs.</description>

      <title>Explicit realization of bounded modules for symplectic Lie algebras: spinor versus oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit combinatorial realization of all simple and injective (hence, and projective) modules in the category of bounded $\mathfrak{sp}(2n)$-modules. This realization is defined via a natural tableaux correspondence between spinor-type modules of $\mathfrak{so}(2n)$ and oscillator-type modules of $\mathfrak{sp}(2n)$. In particular, we show that, in contrast with the $A$-type case, the generic and bounded $\mathfrak{sp}(2n)$-modules admit an analog of the Gelfand-Graev continuation from finite-dimensional representations.</description>

      <title>The derived dimensions and representation distances of artin algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a well-known class of algebras called Igusa-Todorov algebras which were introduced in relation to finitistic dimension conjecture. As a generalization of Igusa-Todorov algebras, the new notion of $(m,n)$-Igusa-Todorov algebras provides a wider framework for studying derived dimensions. In this paper, we give a method for constructing $(m,n)$-Igusa-Todorov algebras. As an application, we present for general artin algebras a relationship between the derived dimension and the representation distance. Moreover, we end this paper to show that the main result can be used to give a better upper bound for the derived dimension for some classes of algebras.</description>

Abstract: We study the space $S(X)^I$ of smooth functions on a symmetric space $X=G/H$ invariant to the action of an Iwahori subgroup $I$, as a module over $\mathcal{H}(G,I)$, the Iwahori Hecke algebra of a p-adic group $G$. We present a description of this module that generalizes the description given to $\mathcal{H}(G,I)$ by Iwahori and Matsumoto.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $\rho:G \to \GL(V)$ a finite dimensional representation of $G$. We say that $\rho$ is unisingular if $\det(1-\rho(g)) = 0$ for all $g \in G$. Building on previous work in \cite{cullinan}, we consider the symmetric groups $S_n$ and prove that certain families of Specht modules are always unisingular as well as raise new questions for future study.</description>

      <title>Canonical form of matrix factorizations from Fukaya category of surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns homological mirror symmetry for the pair-of-pants surface (A-side) and the non-isolated surface singularity $xyz=0$ (B-side). Burban-Drozd classified indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules on the B-side. We prove that higher-multiplicity band-type modules correspond to higher-rank local systems over closed geodesics on the A-side, generalizing our previous work for the multiplicity one case. This provides a geometric interpretation of the representation tameness of the band-type maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, as every indecomposable object is realized as a geometric object.
  We also present an explicit canonical form of matrix factorizations of $xyz$ corresponding to Burban-Drozd's canonical form of band-type maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules. As applications, we give a geometric interpretation of algebraic operations such as AR translation and duality of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules as well as certain mapping cone operations.</description>

      <title>The classification of simple complex Lie superalgebras of polynomial vector fields and their deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We overview classifications of simple infinite-dimensional complex $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie (super)algebras of polynomial growth, and their deformations. A subset of such Lie (super)algebras consist of vectorial Lie (super)algebras whose elements are vector fields with polynomial, or formal power series, or divided power coefficients. A given vectorial Lie (super)algebra with a (Weisfeiler) filtration corresponding to a maximal subalgebra of finite codimension is called W-filtered; the associated graded algebra is called W-graded. Here, we correct several published results: (1) prove our old claim "the superization of \'E. Cartan's problem (classify primitive Lie algebras) is wild", (2) solve a tame problem: classify simple W-graded and W-filtered vectorial Lie superalgebras, (3) describe the supervariety of deformation parameters for the serial W-graded simple vectorial superalgebras, (4) conjecture that the exceptional simple vectorial superalgebras are rigid. We conjecture usefulness of our method in classification of simple infinite-dimensional vectorial Lie (super)algebras over fields of positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Deformation of the Gaiotto-Rap\v{c}\'{a}k Corner VOA and the Associated Partially Symmetric Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>

      <title>The microlocal Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for complex contact manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kashiwara showed in 1996 that the categories of microlocalized D-modules can be canonically glued to give a sheaf of categories over a complex contact manifold. Much more recently, and by rather different considerations, we constructed a canonical notion of perverse microsheaves on the same class of spaces. Here we provide a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence.</description>

      <title>Prescribed mean curvature problems on homogeneous vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic study of weak (singular) Hermite-Einstein structures on homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles over rational homogeneous varieties. We use standard tools from spectral geometry, Harmonic analysis, and Cartan's highest weight theory to provide a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier series and intersection numbers under which an $L^{2}$-function can be realized as mean curvature of a singular Hermitian structure on an irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle. We prove that the condition provided is necessary and sufficient for functions that belong to certain interpolation spaces. In the particular case of line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type, we describe explicitly in terms of representation theory the solutions of the underlying geometric PDE. Also, we establish a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier coefficients and intersection numbers for solvability and convergence of the weak Hermite-Einstein flow on irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles. As an application of our methods, we describe the first explicit examples in the literature of solutions to several geometric flows, including Donaldson's heat flow, Yang-Mills heat flow, and the gradient flow of Donaldson's Lagrangian, on line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. Additionally, we show that every polynomial central charge function gives rise to a weak Donaldson's Lagrangian $\mathcal{M}$. In the particular case of irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles, we prove that the gradient flow of $\mathcal{M}$ converges to a Hermitian structure which is, up to a gauge transformation, a $Z$-critical Hermitian structure in the large volume limit.</description>

Abstract: Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system of affine type D, and let TL(W) the corresponding generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra. In this extended abstract we define an infinite dimensional associative algebra made of decorated diagrams which is isomorphic to TL(W). Moreover, we describe an explicit basis for such an algebra of diagrams which is in bijective correspondence with the classical monomial basis of TL(W), indexed by the fully commutative elements of W.

      <description>arXiv:2012.15707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define admissible and weakly admissible subcategories in exact categories and prove that the former induce semi-orthogonal decompositions on the derived categories. We develop the theory of thin exact categories, an exact-category analogue of triangulated categories generated by exceptional collections.
  The right and left abelian envelopes of exact categories are introduced, an example being the category of coherent sheaves on a scheme as the right envelope of the category of vector bundles. The existence of right (left) abelian envelopes is proved for exact categories with projectively (injectively) generating subcategories with weak (co)kernels.
  We show that highest weight categories are precisely the right/left envelopes of thin categories. Ringel duality is interpreted as a duality between the right and left abelian envelopes of a thin exact category. The duality for thin exact categories is introduced by means of derived categories and Serre functor on them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a simply-laced semisimple Lie algebra. We study the crystal $ B(n\lambda)$, were $\lambda$ is a dominant minuscule weight and $n$ is a natural number. On one hand, $B(n\lambda)$ can be realized combinatorially by height $n$ reverse plane partitions on a heap associated to $\lambda$. On the other hand, we use this heap to define a module over the preprojective algebra of the underlying Dynkin quiver. Using the work of Saito and Savage-Tingley, we realize $B(n\lambda)$ via irreducible components of the quiver Grassmannian of $n$ copies of this module. In this paper, we describe an explicit bijection between these two models for $B(n\lambda)$ and prove that our bijection yields an isomorphism of crystals. Our main geometric tool is Nakajima's tensor product quiver varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and let $V$ be a free $R$-module of rank $n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Fixing an $R$-basis $\mathcal{E}$ of $V$, the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ acts on $V$ by permuting $\mathcal{E}$ and hence on tensor space $V^{\otimes r}$ for $r\in\mathbb{N}$ via the usual tensor product action turning $V$ and $V^{\otimes r}$ into $R\mathfrak{S}_n$-modules. For units $q$ in $R$ we construct an action of the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_{R,q}(\mathfrak{S}_n)$ which specializes to the action of $R\mathfrak{S}_n$, if $q$ is taken to $1$. The centralizing algebra of this action is called the $q$-partition algebra $\mathcal{P}_{R,q}(n,r)$. Let $R$ be a field of characteristic not dividing $q$. We prove, that $\mathcal{P}_{R,q}(n,r)$ is isomorphic to the $q$-partition algebra defined by Halverson and Thiem by different means a few years ago.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\bf G}$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements,where $q$ is a power of a prime number $p$. Let $\Bbbk$ be a field and we study the extensions of certain $\bk\bg$-modules in this paper. We show that the extensions of any modules in $\mathscr{O}(\bg)$ by a finite-dimensional $\bk\bg$-module is zero if $p\ne \op{char}\bk\ge5$ or $\op{char}\bk=0$, where $\mathscr{O}(\bg)$ is the principal representation category defined in \cite{D1}. We determine the necessary and sufficient condition for the vanishing of extensions between naive induced modules. As an application, we give the condition of the vanishing of extensions between simple modules in $\mathscr{O}({\bf G})$ for $\bg=SL_2(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the ordinary irreducible representations of the group of automorphisms of a finite, rooted tree may be obtained following one of the classical method used for the irreducible representations of the symmetric group, namely the approach in Chapter 2 of the classical book by James and Kerber. To reach this goal, we introduce and study the combinatorics of tree compositions, a natural generalization of set compositions but with new features and more complexity due to the tree structure. This leads to a natural parametrization of the conjugacy classes and of the irreducible representations by means of the same combinatorial objects. Our trees are not necessarily spherically homogeneous and our approach is coordinate free.</description>

      <title>On fibered Burnside rings, fiber change maps and cyclic fiber groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fibered Burnside rings appear as Grothendieck rings of fibered permutation representations of a finite group, generalizing Burnside rings and monomial representation rings. Their species, primitive idempotents and their conductors are of particular interest in representation theory as they encode information related to the structure of the group. In this note, we introduce fiber change maps between fibered Burnside rings, and we present results on their functoriality and naturality with respect to biset operations. We present some advances on the conductors for cyclic fiber groups, and fully determine them in particular cases, covering a wide range of interesting examples.</description>

      <title>Local Langlands correspondences in $\ell$-adic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.14154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be a prime number different from the residue characteristic of a non-archimedean local field $F$. We give formulations of $\ell$-adic local Langlands correspondences for connected reductive algebraic groups over $F$, which we conjecture to be independent of a choice of an isomorphism between the $\ell$-adic coefficient field and the complex number field.</description>

      <title>On blended extensions in filtered tannakian categories and motives with maximal unipotent radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grothendieck's theory of blended extensions (extensions panach\'ees) gives a natural framework to study 3-step filtrations in abelian categories. We give a generalization of this theory that is suitable for filtrations with an arbitrary finite number of steps. We use this generalization to study two natural classification problems for objects with a fixed associated graded in a filtered tannakian category over a field of characteristic zero. We then give an application to the study of mixed motives with a given associated graded and maximal unipotent radicals of motivic Galois groups. We prove a homological classification result for such motives when the given associated graded is "graded-independent", a condition defined in the paper. The special case of this result for motives with 3 weights was proved earlier with K. Murty under some extra hypotheses. The paper also includes some discussions on periods.</description>

      <title>A trilogy of mapping class group representations from three-dimensional quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a punctured surface $\mathfrak{S}$, the author and Scarinci (arXiv:2112.13329) have recently constructed a quantization of a moduli space of Lorentzian metrics on the 3-manifold $\mathfrak{S} \times \mathbb{R}$ of constant sectional curvature $\Lambda \in \{-1,0,1\}$. The invariance of this quantization under the action of the mapping class group ${\rm MCG}(\mathfrak{S})$ of $\mathfrak{S}$ yields families of unitary representations of ${\rm MCG}(\mathfrak{S})$ on a Hilbert space, with key ingredients being three versions of the quantum dilogarithm functions depending on $\Lambda$. In this survey article, we review and elaborate on this result.</description>

      <title>A crossed module representation of a $2$-group constructed from the $3$-loop group $\Omega^3 G$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization of chiral fermions on a 3-manifold in an external gauge potential is known to lead to an abelian extension of the gauge group. In this article we concentrate on the case of $\Omega^3 G$ of based smooth maps on a 3-sphere taking values in a compact Lie group $G.$ There is a crossed module constructed from an abelian extension $\widehat{\Omega^3 G}$ of this group and a group of automorphims acting on it as explained in a recent article by Mickelson and Niemim\"aki. We shall construct a representation of this crossed module in terms of a repesentation of $\widehat{\Omega^3 G}$ on a space of functions of gauge potentials with values in a fermionic Fock space and a representation of the automorphism group of $\widehat{\Omega^3 G}$ as outer automorphisms of the canonical anticommutation relations algebra in the Fock space.</description>

      <title>A resolution theorem for extriangulated categories with applications to the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10576v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quillen's Resolution Theorem in algebraic $K$-theory provides a powerful computational tool for calculating $K$-groups of exact categories. At the level of $K_0$, this result goes back to Grothendieck. In this article, we first establish an extriangulated version of Grothendieck's Resolution Theorem.
  Second, we use this Extriangulated Resolution Theorem to gain new insight into the index theory of triangulated categories. Indeed, we propose an index with respect to an extension-closed subcategory $\mathscr{N}$ of a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ and we prove an additivity formula with error term. Our index recovers the index with respect to a contravariantly finite, rigid subcategory $\mathscr{X}$ defined by J{\o}rgensen and the second author, as well as an isomorphism between $K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$ and the Grothendieck group of a relative extriangulated structure $\mathscr{C}_{R}^{\mathscr{X}}$ on $\mathscr{C}$ when $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting. In addition, we generalize and enhance some results of Fedele. Our perspective allows us to remove certain restrictions and simplify some arguments.
  Third, as another application of our Extriangulated Resolution Theorem, we show that if $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting in an abelian category, then the index introduced by Reid gives an isomorphism $K_0(\mathscr{C}_R^{\mathscr{X}}) \cong K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$.</description>

      <title>On a general notion of a polynomial identity and codimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the braided version of Lawvere's algebraic theories and Mac Lane's PROPs, we introduce polynomial identities for arbitrary algebraic structures in a braided monoidal category C as well as their codimensions in the case when C is linear over some field. The new cases include coalgebras, bialgebras, Hopf algebras, braided vector spaces, Yetter-Drinfel'd modules, etc. We find bases for polynomial identities and calculate codimensions in some important particular cases.</description>
