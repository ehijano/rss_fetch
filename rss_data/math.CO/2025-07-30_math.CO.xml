      <title>Spectral properties of distance Laplacian matrices of complex unit gain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex unit gain graph ($ \mathbb{T} $-gain graph), $ \Phi=(G, \varphi) $ is a graph where the function $ \varphi $ assigns a unit complex number to each orientation of an edge of $ G $, and its inverse is assigned to the opposite orientation. In this article, we study several spectral properties of distance Laplacian matrices of $\mathbb{T}$-gain graphs. In particular, we establish a characterization for the balanced $ \mathbb{T}$-gain graph in terms of the nullity of gain distance Laplacian matrices. As an example, it is shown that two switching equivalent $ \mathbb{T} $-gain graphs need not imply that their distance Laplacian spectra are the same. However, we provide a necessary condition for which two switching equivalent $ \mathbb{T} $-gain graphs have the same distance Laplacian spectra. Furthermore, we present a lower bound for spectral radii of gain distance Laplacian matrices in terms of the winner index. In addition, we establish some upper bounds for spectral radii of gain distance Laplacian matrices and characterize the equalities.</description>

      <title>Non-Hamiltonian 2-regular Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier papers, we showed a decomposition of 2-diregular digraphs (2-dds) and used it to provide some sufficient conditions for these graphs to be non-Hamiltonian; we also showed a close connection between the permanent and determinant of the adjacency matrices of these digraphs and gave some enumeration and generation results. In the present paper we extend the discussion to a larger class of digraphs, introduce the notions of routes and quotients and use them to provide additional criteria for 2-dds to be non-Hamiltonian. Though individual non-Hamiltonian regular connected graphs of low degree are known (e.g. Tutte and Meredith graphs), families of such graphs are not common in the literature; even scarcer are families of such digraphs. Our results identify a few such families.</description>

      <title>On the DP-chromatic Number of Cartesian Products of Critical Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) is a well-studied generalization of list coloring introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in 2015. The following sharp bound on the DP-chromatic number of the Cartesian product of graphs $G$ and $H$ is known: $\chi_{DP}(G \square H) \leq \text{min}\{\chi_{DP}(G) + \text{col}(H), \chi_{DP}(H) + \text{col}(G) \} - 1$ where $\chi_{DP}(G)$ is the DP-chromatic number of $G$ and $\text{col}(H)$ is the coloring number of $H$. We seek to understand when $\chi_{DP}(G \square K_{l,t})$ is far from its chromatic number: $\chi(G \square K_{l,t}) = \max \{\chi(G), 2 \}$ in the case that $G$ is a $k$-critical graph with $\chi_{DP}(G)=k$. In particular, we have $\chi_{DP}(G \square K_{l,t}) \leq k + l$, and for fixed $l$ we wish to find the smallest $t$ for which this upper bound is achieved. This can be viewed as an extension of the classic result that the list chromatic number of $K_{l,t}$ is $l+1$ if and only if $t \geq l^l$. Our results illustrate that the DP color function of $G$, the DP analogue of the chromatic polynomial, provides a concept and tool that is useful for making progress on this problem.</description>

      <title>Slavic Techniques for Hat Guessing Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2023 undergraduate thesis on a deterministic "hat game." For a digraph $D$, each player stands on a vertex $v$, is assigned a hat from $h(v)$ possible colors, and makes $g(v)$ guesses of her hat's color based on her out-neighbors' hats. If there exists a collective strategy that guarantees a correct guess for any hat assignment, the game is winnable. Which games $(D,g,h)$ are winnable? Two much-studied parameters: $\mu(D)$ is the maximum integer $k$ such that $(D,1,k)$ is winnable, and $\hat{\mu}(D)$ is the supremum of $h/g$ for integer $h, g$ such that $(D,g,h)$ is winnable.
  Chapter 0 is a casual, riddle-based introduction. Chapter 1 taxonomizes the games, surveys all previous work, and summarizes the piece. Chapter 2 proves lemmata and easy cases. Chapter 3 uses "hats as hints" and "admissible paths" for games on cycles. Chapter 4 generalizes several "constructors" and applies them to tree games. Chapter 5 uses "combinatorial prisms" for a new angle on the well-studied $K_{n,m}$ games. In chapter 6, we apply "dependency digraphs" to the continuous limit of this game. Chapter 7 collects open problems and minor results.
  We show:
  $(C_{k\geq 4},1,h)$ is winnable if and only if: $h=3$ and $k$ is divisible by $3$ or equal to $4$, $h\leq 4$ and the $h(v)$ sequence $(3,2,3)$ or $(2,3,3)$ appears in the cycle, or the $h(v)$ sequence $(2,...,2)$ appears with no intervening value $&gt;4$.
  $(T, 1, h)$ is winnable for tree $T$ iff $T$ has a subtree $T'$ with $h(v)\leq 2^{deg_{T'}(v)}$ for all $v\in V(T')$.
  For a digraph $D$, $\hat{\mu}(D)\leq e(\Delta^-+1)$. For a graph $G$, $\hat{\mu}(G)\leq (\Delta-1)^{1-\Delta} \Delta^{\Delta}&lt;e\Delta$.
  $(\overrightarrow{C}_k, g, h)$ is unwinnable if $g(v_i)/h(v_i) + g(v_{i+1})/h(v_{i+1}) &lt; 1$ for some $i$.
  And much else. Important open questions: what other graph parameters or properties bound $\mu$? What complexity classes are at play?</description>

      <title>Solid bricks that every $b$-invariant edge is solitary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a brick if it is 3-connected and $G-\{u,v\}$ has a perfect matching for any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$. A brick $G$ is solid if for any two vertex disjoint odd cycles $C_1$ and $C_2$ of $G$, $G-(V(C_1)\cup V(C_2))$ has no perfect matching. Lucchesi and Murty proposed a problem concerning the characterization of bricks, distinct from $K_4$, $\overline{C_6}$ and the Petersen graph, in which every $b$-invariant edge is solitary. In this paper, we show that for a solid brick $G$ of order $n$ that is distinct from $K_4$, every $b$-invariant edge of $G$ is solitary if and only if $G$ is a wheel $W_n$.</description>

      <title>Partial Deranged Bell Numbers and Their Combinatorial Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generalization of deranged Bell numbers by defining the partial deranged Bell numbers $w_{n,r}$, which count the number of set partitions of $\left[ n\right] $ with exactly $r$ fixed blocks, while the remaining blocks are deranged. This construction provides a unified framework that connects partial derangements, Stirling numbers, and ordered Bell numbers. We investigate their combinatorial properties, including explicit formulas, generating functions, and recurrence relations. Moreover, we demonstrate that these numbers are expressible in terms of classical sequences such as deranged Bell numbers and ordered Bell numbers, and reveal their relationship to complementary Bell numbers, offering insights relevant to Wilf's conjecture. Notably, we derive the identity \[ \tilde{\phi}_{n}=\Tilde{w}_{n,0}-\Tilde{w}_{n,1}=\tilde{w}_{n-1,0}-2\tilde {w}_{n-1,2}, \] which illustrates their structural connection to complementary Bell numbers. We also introduce a polynomial expansion for these numbers and explore their connections with exponential polynomials, geometric polynomials, and Bernoulli numbers. These relationships facilitate the derivation of closed-form expressions for certain finite summations involving Stirling numbers of the second kind, Bernoulli numbers, and binomial coefficients, articulated through partial derangement numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that each number $1,2,...,N$ has one of n colours assigned. We show that if there are no monochromatic solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+x_3=y_1+y_2$, then $N=O((n!)^{1/2})$, improving upon a result of Cwalina and Schoen. Further, a stronger bound of $N=O(((n-k)!)^{1/2})$, where $k\gg\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$ is shown for colourings avoiding solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+...+x_{12}=y_1+y_2+...+y_9$. Finally, some remarks on other equations are presented.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Cayley digraphs on dihedral groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the enumeration of Cayley digraphs, focusing on counting Cayley digraphs on dihedral groups up to CI-isomorphism. By leveraging the Cauchy-Frobenius Lemma and properties of automorphisms, we derive an explicit formula for the number of non-isomorphic Cayley digraphs on dihedral groups with DCI-property, particularly for the group $\mathrm{D}_{6p}$ with $p&gt;3$ a prime. The enumeration involves detailed analysis of cycle numbers of automorphisms and their actions on the group elements, culminating in a precise count of non-isomorphic digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining two well-studied variants of the classical Tur\'{a}n problem, the generalized Tur\'{a}n problem and the spectral Tur\'{a}n problem, we introduce the spectral generalized Tur\'{a}n problem and establish a general theorem that extends the result of Keevash--Lenz--Mubayi~\cite{KLM14} on the spectral Tur\'{a}n problem in this broader setting. As a quick application, we obtain the spectral Erd\H{o}s Pentagon Theorem. We also introduce the notion of entropic density for generalized Tur\'{a}n problems, and show that it coincides with the generalized spectral radius, extending a recent result of Chao--Hans on entropic Tur\'{a}n density.</description>

      <title>The spectra of graph substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,E_X)$ and $(V,E_V)$ be finite connected graphs without loops. We assume that $V$ has two distinguished vertices $a,b$ and an automorphism $\gamma$ which exchanges $a$ and $b$. The $V$-edge substitution of $X$ is the graph $X[V]$ where each edge $[x,y] \in E_X$ is replaced by a copy of $V$, identifying $x$ with $a$ and $y$ with $b$ or vice versa. (The latter choice does not matter; it yields isomorphic graphs). The aim is to describe the spectrum of $X[V]$ in terms of the spectra of $X$ and $V$. Instead of the spectra of the adjacency matrices, we consider the versions which are normalised by dividing each row by the row sum (the vertex degree). These are stochastic, reversible matrices, and our approach applies more generally to reversible transition matrices corresponding to arbitrary positive edge weights invariant under $\gamma$. We write $P$ for the transition matrix over $X$ and $Q$ for the one over $V$. Together, they induce the matrix $P_*$ over $X[V]$.
  There is not a nice and compact formula which says how to transform the spectra of $P$ and $Q$ into the spectrum of $P_*\,$. The results depend on issues like whether $X$ has circles of even length and on the eigenvalues of the restriction of $Q$ to $V \setminus \{ a,b\}$, which are classified into 4 possible types, each to be handled differently. Also quite subtle is the issue of determining the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of $P_*$ in terms of the input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a point set, mostly a grid in our case, we seek upper and lower bounds on the number of curves that are needed to cover the point set. We say a curve covers a point if the curve passes through the point. We consider such coverings by monotonic curves, lines, orthoconvex curves, circles, etc. We also study a problem that is converse of the covering problem -- if a set of $n^2$ points in the plane is covered by $n$ lines then can we say something about the configuration of the points?</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that coherent configurations can be represented as modules over Frobenius structures in the category of real nonnegative matrices. We generalize the notion of admissible morphism from association schemes to coherent configurations. We show that the Frobenius structure associated to a coherent configuration can be modified to become a dagger Frobenius structure, and use this to connect the coherent configurations to groupoids and $H^*$-algebras. We examine the properties of the dagger Frobenius structure with respect to admissible morphisms. We introduce the matrix $O$ obtained as the composition of comultiplication and multiplication of the dagger Frobenius structure and prove that we may obtain the valencies of colors, and thus recover the original coherent configuration, as an eigenvector of $O$. In the last part of the paper, we examine the spectrum of $O$ and apply it to generalize the Lagrange theorem from groups to association schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Ramsey statement for pairs of maps between trees, where one is an embedding as defined by Deuber and the other is a rigid surjection as defined by Solecki. We show that there is no Ramsey Theorem for pairs of maps where the coloring depends on both coordinates. On the other hand, we give a characterization of the Ramsey degrees for such pairs. Furthermore, we show that our theorem on Ramsey Degrees for pairs of maps between trees implies the Ramsey Theorem for pairs of maps between linear orders as proved by Solecki.</description>

      <title>A note on the strength of a hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a generalization of super magic strength, the strength of a graph was introduced in [R. Ichishima, F.A. Muntaner-Batle, A. Oshima, Bounds for the strength of graphs, Austral. J. of Combin. 72(3) (2018) 492-508]. For a vertex ordering $f$ of graph $G$, the strength of $f$ is the maximum sum of the labels on any pair of adjacent vertices. The strength of $G$ is defined as the minimum strength of $f$, taken over all vertex orderings of $G$. The strength of the hypercube is unknown, but bounded. In this note, we provide an improved upper bound for the strength of a hypercube.</description>

Abstract: We classify trivalent graphs with 16 vertices and 16 edges that arise from intersecting two quadratic surfaces in tropical 3-space. There are 4,009 such graphs, representing maximally degenerate stable models of elliptic curves realized as tropical complete intersections of two quadrics. Our classification is derived from 405,246,030 regular unimodular triangulations of the 4-dimensional Cayley polytope.</description>

      <title>On the $l_\infty$-analog of Algebraic Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic connectivity $a(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as the second smallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix $L(G)$. It also admits a variational characterization as the minimum of a quadratic form associated with $L(G)$, subject to $l_2$-norm constraints. In 2024, Andrade and Dahl investigated an analogous parameter $\gamma(G)$, defined using the $l_\infty$-norm instead of the $l_2$-norm. They demonstrated that $\gamma(G)$ can be computed in polynomial time using linear programming. In this article, we study the combinatorial significance of $\gamma(G)$, revealing that it can be efficiently computed using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We show that $\gamma (G)$ characterizes the connectedness of the graph $G$. We further establish new bounds on $\gamma(G)$, and analyze the graphs that attain extremal values. Finally, we derive an elegant formula for $\gamma(G)$ when $G$ is the Cartesian product of finitely many graphs. Applying this formula, we explicitly compute $\gamma(G)$ for various families of graphs, including hypercube graphs, Hamming graphs, and others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a product of fundamental crystals of type $C_n$ in monomial realization, where the product means a natural product of Laurent monomials, not a tensor product. Then we shall show that the product still holds a crystal structure and describe how it is decomposed into irreducible crystals, which is, in general, different from the decomposition rule for the tensor product of the fundamental crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Coh zeta function for a family of inert quadratic orders, which we conjecture to be given by $t$-deformed Bressoud $q$-series. This completes a trilogy connecting the zeta functions of ramified and split quadratic orders to the classical Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities, respectively. We provide strong evidence for this conjecture by deriving the first explicit formulas for the finitized Coh zeta function of the simplest order in the family, and for the $t=1$ specialization of the finitized Coh zeta functions for all orders in the family. Our primary tool is a new method based on M\"obius inversion on posets.</description>

      <title>Perfect Graph Modification Problems: An Integer Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph modification problems, which aim to find a small set of modifications to a graph so that it satisfies a desired property, have been studied for several special graph classes. The literature is rather rich in NP-completeness results and polynomial time solvable cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few exact algorithms have been suggested to address NP-hard cases. In this work, we propose exact solution methods based on integer programming for three perfect graph modification problems: minimum perfect editing, minimum perfect completion and the perfect sandwich problem. The minimum perfect editing problem inquires the smallest number of edge additions and deletions to make a graph perfect, while the completion problem allows only edge additions. In the perfect sandwich problem, only a given subset of non-edges can be changed to edges, and the problem asks whether a perfect graph can be obtained in this way. The proposed methods are based on the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem. We represent odd holes and odd antiholes as linear inequalities, and formulate an integer programming model to solve minimum perfect editing problem. To address the exponential number of constraints, we propose a cutting plane algorithm which relies on finding odd holes and odd antiholes. To enhance the practical efficiency of the cutting plane algorithm, we address the expected number of odd holes and odd antiholes in random graphs. In addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm to make a given graph perfect, which is used to obtain improved upper bounds for the editing and the completion problems. Finally, we demonstrate empirical effectiveness of the proposed methods through computational experiments.</description>

Abstract: Along with his confirmation of the $e$-positivity of all cycle-chord graphs $\theta_{ab1}$, the third author conjectured the $e$-positivity of all theta graphs $\theta_{abc}$. In this paper, we establish the $e$-positivity of all clock graphs $\theta_{ab2}$ by using the composition method. The key idea is to investigate the fibers of certain partial reversal transformation on compositions with all parts at least $2$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial properties of continuous graphs: A survey of challenges, solutions and open problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by notorious combinatorial optimization problems on graphs, in this paper we consider a series of related problems defined using a metric space and topology determined by a graph. Particularly, we present the Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Chromatic Number and Treewidth problems on, so-called, continuous or metric graphs where every edge is represented by a unit-length continuous interval rather than by a pair of vertices. If any point of any unit-interval edge is considered as a possible member of a hitting set or a cover, the classical combinatorial problems become trickier and many open questions arise. Notably, in many real-life applications, such a continuous view of a graph is more natural than the classic combinatorial definition of a graph. The contribution of this paper is twofold: i) we survey the known results for optimization problems on continuous graphs, and ii) we create a list of open problems related to the continuous graphs.</description>

      <title>Generalized De Bruijn Words, Invertible Necklaces, and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define generalized de Bruijn words as those words having a Burrows-Wheeler transform that is a concatenation of permutations of the alphabet. We show that generalized de Bruijn words are in 1-to-1 correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime $p$, we define invertible necklaces as those whose BWT-matrix is non-singular. We show that invertible necklaces of length $n$ correspond to normal bases of the finite field $F_{p^n}$, and that they form an Abelian group isomorphic to the Reutenauer group $RG_p^n$. Using known results in abstract algebra, we can make a bridge between generalized de Bruijn words and invertible necklaces. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$'s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $F_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, for positive integers $n,a_1, a_2, a_3$ satisfying $a_1+a_2+a_3 = n-1$, it holds that any bipartite graph $G$ which is the union of three perfect matchings $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$ on $2n$ vertices contains a matching $M$ such that $|M\cap M_i| =a_i$ for $i= 1,2,$ and $3$. The bound $n-1$ on the sum is best possible in general. Our result verifies the multiplicity extension of the Ryser-Brualdi-Stein Conjecture, proposed recently by Anastos, Fabian, M\"uyesser, and Szab\'o, for three colors.</description>

Abstract: We study the generating functions of cylindric partitions having profile $c=(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_r)$ with rank $2$ and levels $2, 3$ and $4$. As a result, we give expressions alternative to Borodin's formula for these generating functions. We use the method of weighted words which was first introduced by Alladi and Gordon, later was applied by Dousse in a new version to prove some partition identities and to get infinite products. We adapt the method to our subject with a more combinatorial approach.</description>

      <title>Improved Decomposition Bounds for Partition Polytopes and Odd-Covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assignments of a set of $m$ items into $n$ clusters of prescribed sizes $k_1,\dots,k_n$ can be encoded as the vertices of the partition polytope $\mathrm{PP}(k_1,\dots,k_n)$. We prove that, if $K = \max\{k_1,\dots,k_n\}$, then the combinatorial diameter of $\mathrm{PP}(k_1,\dots,k_n)$ is at most $\lceil 3K/2\rceil$. This improves the previously known upper bound of $2K$.
  A cycle (or path) odd-cover of a graph $G$ is a set of cycles (or paths) with symmetric difference $G$. We prove that every Eulerian graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ admits a cycle odd-cover and a path odd-cover, each of size at most $\lceil 3\Delta/4\rceil$. This improves the previously known upper bound of $\Delta$.
  The two proofs share many similarities and are both based on the proof of Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary that every graph with maximum degree 4 has linear arboricity at most 3.</description>

      <title>Optimal stability results on color-biased Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Hamilton cycles in edge-colored graphs with \( r \) colors, focusing on the notion of color-bias (discrepancy), the maximum deviation from uniform color frequencies along a cycle. Foundational work by Balogh, Csaba, Jing, and Pluh\'{a}r, and the later generalization by Freschi, Hyde, Lada, and Treglown, as well as an independent work by Gishboliner, Krivelevich, and Michaeli, established that any \(n\)-vertex graph with minimum degree exceeding \( \frac{(r+1)n}{2r} + \frac{m}{2}\) contains a Hamilton cycle with color-bias at least \(m\), and characterized the extremal graphs with minimum degree \(\frac{(r+1)n}{2r}\) in which all Hamilton cycles are perfectly balanced.
  We prove the optimal stability results: for any positive integers \(r\ge 2\) and \( m &lt; 2^{-6} r^{2} n,\) if every Hamilton cycle in an \( n \)-vertex graph with minimum degree exceeding \( \frac{n}{2} + 6r^{2}m \) has color-bias less than \( m \), then the graph must closely resemble the extremal constructions of Freschi, Hyde, Lada, and Treglown. The leading term \( \frac{n}{2} \) in the degree condition is optimal, as it is the sharp threshold for guaranteeing Hamiltonicity. Moreover, we show the additive error term \(\Theta(m)\) is also best possible when \(m\) is large and \(r=2\), since weaker condition \(\frac{n}{2}+o(m)\) allow for a counterexample. Notably, the structural stability threshold \( \frac{1}{2} \) lies strictly below the extremal threshold \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2r} \) required to force color imbalance. Our proof leverages local configurations to deduce global structure, revealing a rigid combinatorial dichotomy.</description>

Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are useful in representing the evolutionary history of taxa. In certain scenarios, one requires a way to compare different networks. In practice, this can be rather difficult, except within specific classes of networks. In this paper, we derive metrics for the class of \emph{orchard networks} and the class of \emph{strongly reticulation-visible} networks, from variants of so-called \emph{$\mu$-representations}, which are vector representations of networks. For both network classes, we impose degree constraints on the vertices, by considering \emph{semi-binary} networks.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a form of square-root cancellation for the operator which sums a mean-zero function over a hyperplane in $R^d$ for $R$ a possibly noncommutative finite ring. Using an argument of Hart, Iosevich, Koh, and Rudnev, we show that this square-root cancellation occurs when $R$ is a finite field. We then show that this square-root cancellation does not occur over finite rings which are not finite fields. This extends an earlier result of the author to an operator which is not translation-invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-free additive and multiplicative convolutions are operations on the set of polynomials with real roots, introduced independently by Szeg\"{o} and Walsh in the 1920s. These operations have regained some interest, in the last decade, after being rediscovered by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava as the expected characteristic polynomial of randomly rotated matrices. They converge, as the degree $d$ of the polynomials increases, to the additive and multiplicative convolution of measures from free probability of Voiculescu. In this paper, we investigate the fluctuations of order $1/d$ -- also known as infinitesimal distributions -- related to these two operations and their limiting behavior, providing a detailed description of their convergence. Our approach relies on understanding the infinitesimal moment-cumulant formulas and the corresponding functional relations. We also establish several applications and examples, including instances related to the infinitesimal free convolution of Belinschi and Shlyakhtenko, as well as the computation of infinitesimal distributions after differentiation of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Metaconcepts of rooted tree balance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measures of tree balance play an important role in many different research areas such as mathematical phylogenetics or theoretical computer science. Typically, tree balance is quantified by a single number which is assigned to the tree by a balance or imbalance index, of which several exist in the literature. Most of these indices are based on structural aspects of tree shape, such as clade sizes or leaf depths. For instance, indices like the Sackin index, total cophenetic index, and $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic all quantify tree balance through clade sizes, albeit with different definitions and properties.
  In this paper, we formalize the idea that many tree (im)balance indices are functions of similar underlying tree shape characteristics by introducing metaconcepts of tree balance. A metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on a function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape, such as balance values, clade sizes, or leaf depths. These metaconcepts encompass existing indices but also provide new means of measuring tree balance. The versatility and generality of metaconcepts allow for the systematic study of entire families of (im)balance indices, providing deeper insights that extend beyond index-by-index analysis.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimate for discrete Schr\"odinger equation on layered King's grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the sharp \( l^1 \to l^{\infty} \) decay estimate for the discrete Schr\"odinger equation (DS) on the Layered King's Grid (LKG), with a dispersive decay rate of \( \langle t \rangle^{-13/12} \), which is faster than that for $3$-dimensional lattice (\( \langle t \rangle^{-1} \), see \cite{SK05}). This decay estimate enables us to derive the corresponding Strichartz estimate via the standard Keel--Tao argument. Our approach relies on using techniques from Newton polyhedra to analyze singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</description>
