      <title>Cosmic averaging over multiscaled structure: on foliations, gauges and backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation that accelerated cosmic expansion is dominant since the Mega-parsec cosmic structure became nonlinear seems like an extraordinary coincidence, unless the acceleration is somehow driven by the emergence of the structure. That has given rise to the controversial concept of a gravitational backreaction through which inhomogeneity becomes a driver of accelerated expansion. The standard route when studying strongly inhomogeneous cosmological models is to take either a perturbative approach or a spatial averaging approach. Here we argue that because backreaction is in fact a nonlinear multiscale phenomenon, perturbative approaches may have a limited validity. The alternative is the proposed averaging approach. In this paper we demonstrate that the implied backreaction terms are artificial, that is gauge dependent, which may easily cause ambiguous estimates of its significance. In the current study, we forward a formal fully geometric framework of cosmic foliations in the context of relativistic cosmology. Here we show that fixing a foliation of spacetime determines a choice of gauge. Addressing the correspondence between the metric tensor and the foliation allows us to clarify the theoretical implications of choosing a foliation. Within the context of backreaction, this formalism allows us to discuss the complications of averaging. It reveals that spatial averaging can induce artificial backreaction terms that arise from any specific choice of gauge. Averaging methods presented so far all encounter this problem. Within our foliation framework, we can produce a gauge invariant method of averaging by considering a group of proper time foliations which any cosmic observe can agree upon. We demonstrate that this implies the gauge invariance of the averaging procedure. This makes it applicable to standard cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>On the mass distribution of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merging black hole binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories, may help us shed light on how such binaries form. In addition, these detections can help us probe the hypothesized primordial black holes, a candidate for the observed abundance of dark matter. In this work, we study the black-hole mass distribution obtained from the LVK binary black hole merger events. We obtain that distribution by first associating a skewed normal distribution to each event detected with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 8 and then summing all such distributions. We also simulate black hole binaries from two separate populations of merging binaries. One of these is a stellar-origin population that follows a mass-distribution similar to the zero-age mass function of stars. The second population of black holes follows a Gaussian mass-distribution. Such a distribution could approximate a population of black hole binaries formed from earlier black hole mergers in dense stellar environments, or binaries of primordial black holes. For those populations, we evaluate the number of detectable events and fit their combination to the LVK observations. In our work, we rely on a wide range of stellar-origin black-hole mass distributions. We find that the observed LVK events can be fitted much better by the combination of such a stellar-origin mass distribution and a Gaussian distribution, than by the stellar-origin mass distribution alone.</description>

      <title>Toward the first cosmological results of the NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zeldovich Large Program: The SZ-Mass scaling relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) cluster cosmology, two tools are needed to be able to exploit data from large scale surveys in the millimeter-wave domain. An accurate description of the IntraCluster Medium (ICM) pressure profile is needed along with the scaling relation connecting the SZ brightness to the mass. With its high angular resolution and large field of view, The NIKA2 camera, operating at 150 and 260 GHz, is perfectly suited for precise cluster SZ mapping. The SZ Large Program (LPSZ) of the NIKA2 collaboration is dedicated to the observation of a sample of 38 SZ-selected clusters at intermediate to high redshift and observed both in SZ and X-ray. The current status is that all LPSZ clusters have been observed and the analysis toward the final results is ongoing. We present in detail how NIKA2-LPSZ will obtain a robust estimation of the SZ-Mass scaling relation and how it will be used to obtain cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>Bouncing cosmologies and stability analysis in symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to examining cosmological bouncing scenarios in the framework of the recently proposed symmetric teleparallel gravity (or $f(Q)$ gravity), where the non-metricity scalar $Q$ represents the gravitational interaction. We assume an $f(Q)$ model in the form of $f(Q)=\alpha Q^n$, where $\alpha$ and $n$ are free model parameters. To obtain a bouncing universe, we consider a special form of the scale factor $a(t)$ in terms of cosmic time, specifically $a(t) = (1+\lambda t^2)^{1/3}$, where $\lambda$ is an arbitrary constant. We derive the field equations for the flat FLRW universe and obtain the corresponding exact solution. We investigate the physical behavior of various cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, pressure, and equation of state (EoS) parameter with the energy conditions for our bounce cosmological model. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of the perturbation terms $\delta_m(t)$ and $\delta(t)$ with respect to cosmic time $t$ using the scalar perturbation approach. We found that although the model exhibits unstable behavior at the beginning for a brief period, it shows mostly stable behavior for most of the time. Finally, we conclude that the EoS parameter crosses the quintom line $\omega=-1$ in the vicinity of the bouncing point $t=0$, which confirms the success of our bounce cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Forecasts on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence Constraints for CMB Experiment in the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of cosmic birefringence through Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments is a key research area in cosmology and particle physics, providing a critical test for Lorentz and CPT symmetries. This paper focuses on an upcoming CMB experiment in the mid-latitude of the Northern Hemisphere, and investigates the potential to detect anisotropies in cosmic birefringence. Applying a quadratic estimator on simulated polarization data, we reconstruct the power spectrum of anisotropic cosmic birefringence successfully and estimate constraints on the amplitude of the spectrum, $A_{\mathrm{CB}}$, assuming scale invariance. The forecast is based on a wide-scan observation strategy during winter, yielding an effective sky coverage of approximately 23.6%. We consider two noise scenarios corresponding to the short-term and long-term phases of the experiment. Our results show that with a small aperture telescope operating at 95/150GHz, the $2\sigma$ upper bound for $A_{\mathrm{CB}}$ can reach 0.017 under the low noise scenario when adopting the method of merging multi-frequency data in map domain, and merging multi-frequency data in spectrum domain tightens the limit by about 10%.A large-aperture telescope with the same bands is found to be more effective, tightening the $2\sigma$ upper limit to 0.0062.</description>

      <title>Analytic results in aligned axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original model of axion natural inflation produces a tensor-to-scalar ratio above the experimental limit. Aligned axion inflation admits inflationary trajectories that originate near a saddle point of the two-field potential, and terminate due to the instability of the orthogonal direction. The phenomenology of these solutions is within the current constraints, and a range of parameters will be probed by the next stage CMB experiments. We provide the analytic solution for these trajectories and very compact analytic expressions for the associated phenomenology. For parameters leading to the observed value for the scalar spectral tilt the extension of the inflationary trajectory is sub-Planckian. However, one eigenvalue of the axion kinetic matrix (in the basis that diagonalizes the potential) is trans-Planckian. Finally, we discuss the post-inflationary evolution after the instability. In some cases, the fields reach a second inflationary valley, connected to a minimum. Multiple stages of inflation might be a more general occurrence in multiple-field inflationary models with trajectories starting next to critical points.</description>

      <title>Accurate pulsar timing array residual variances and correlation of the stochastic gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have reported a compelling evidence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. However, the origin of the signal remains undetermined, largely because its spectrum is bluer for an astrophysical source and can be explained by cosmological models. In this letter, we derive theoretically accurate expressions for the Fourier bin variances and correlation of pulsar timing residuals, and demonstrate their outstanding agreement with astrophysical simulations. In contrast, we show that a common power law traditionally used to interpret a stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum is generally faced with systematic errors, one of which is the illusion of a bluer signal. This hints at a conservative solution, supportive of an astrophysical source, to the observed correlated common spectrum process in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from HSC Y1 Weak Lensing with Combined Higher-Order Statistics and Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from weak lensing with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) first-year (Y1) data, using a simulation-based inference (SBI) method. % We explore the performance of a set of higher-order statistics (HOS) including the Minkowski functionals, counts of peaks and minima, and the probability distribution function and compare them to the traditional two-point statistics. The HOS, also known as non-Gaussian statistics, can extract additional non-Gaussian information that is inaccessible to the two-point statistics. We use a neural network to compress the summary statistics, followed by an SBI approach to infer the posterior distribution of the cosmological parameters. We apply cuts on angular scales and redshift bins to mitigate the impact of systematic effects. Combining two-point and non-Gaussian statistics, we obtain $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3} = 0.804_{-0.040}^{+0.041}$ and $\Omega_m = 0.344_{-0.090}^{+0.083}$, similar to that from non-Gaussian statistics alone. These results are consistent with previous HSC analyses and Planck 2018 cosmology. Our constraints from non-Gaussian statistics are $\sim 25\%$ tighter in $S_8$ than two-point statistics, where the main improvement lies in $\Omega_m$, with $\sim 40$\% tighter error bar compared to using the angular power spectrum alone ($S_8 = 0.766_{-0.056}^{+0.054}$ and $\Omega_m = 0.365_{-0.141}^{+0.148}$). We find that, among the non-Gaussian statistics we studied, the Minkowski functionals are the primary driver for this improvement. Our analyses confirm the SBI as a powerful approach for cosmological constraints, avoiding any assumptions about the functional form of the data's likelihood.</description>

      <title>$\mathtt{emuflow}$: Normalising Flows for Joint Cosmological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the growth in the variety and precision of astronomical datasets of interest for cosmology, the best cosmological constraints are invariably obtained by combining data from different experiments. At the likelihood level, one complication in doing so is the need to marginalise over large-dimensional parameter models describing the data of each experiment. These include both the relatively small number of cosmological parameters of interest and a large number of "nuisance" parameters. Sampling over the joint parameter space for multiple experiments can thus become a very computationally expensive operation. This can be significantly simplified if one could sample directly from the marginal cosmological posterior distribution of preceding experiments, depending only on the common set of cosmological parameters. In this paper, we show that this can be achieved by emulating marginal posterior distributions via normalising flows. The resulting trained normalising flow models can be used to efficiently combine cosmological constraints from independent datasets without increasing the dimensionality of the parameter space under study. We show that the method is able to accurately describe the posterior distribution of real cosmological datasets, as well as the joint distribution of different datasets, even when significant tension exists between experiments. The resulting joint constraints can be obtained in a fraction of the time it would take to combine the same datasets at the level of their likelihoods. We construct normalising flow models for a set of public cosmological datasets of general interests and make them available, together with the software used to train them, and to exploit them in cosmological parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for Helium Reionization Detection with Fast Radio Bursts in the Era of Square Kilometre Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a good indicator of the amount of ionized material along the propagation paths. In this work, we present a forecast of He II reionization detection using the DM and redshift measurements of FRBs from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Assuming a model of the Universe in which \he reionization occurred at a specific redshift $z_{\rm re}$, we analyze what extent the signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{S/N}$) for the detection of the amplitude of reionization can be achieved in the era of SKA. Using $10^{6}$ mock FRB data from a one-year observation of the second phase of SKA, we find that the $\mathrm{S/N}$ for detecting He II reionization can approach the $32-50\sigma$ level and the uncertainty on the reionization redshift can be constrained to be $\sigma(z_{\rm re})\approx 0.022-0.031$, depending on the assumed FRB redshift distribution. We also examine the influence of different fiducial $z_{\rm re}$ values, finding that this effect has a modest impact on the forecasts. Our results demonstrate the potentially remarkable capability of SKA-era FRBs in constraining the epoch of He II reionization.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>The impact of baryons on the internal structure of dark matter haloes from dwarf galaxies to superclusters in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift evolution of the concentration-mass relationship of dark matter haloes in state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and their dark-matter-only counterparts. By combining the IllustrisTNG suite and the novel MillenniumTNG simulation, our analysis encompasses a wide range of box size ($50 - 740 \: \rm cMpc$) and mass resolution ($8.5 \times 10^4 - 3.1 \times 10^7 \: \rm M_{\odot}$ per baryonic mass element). This enables us to study the impact of baryons on the concentration-mass relationship in the redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;7$ over an unprecedented halo mass range, extending from dwarf galaxies to superclusters ($\sim 10^{9.5}-10^{15.5} \, \rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the presence of baryons increases the steepness of the concentration-mass relationship at higher redshift, and demonstrate that this is driven by adiabatic contraction of the profile, due to gas accretion at early times, which promotes star formation in the inner regions of haloes. At lower redshift, when the effects of feedback start to become important, baryons decrease the concentration of haloes below the mass scale $\sim 10^{11.5} \, \rm M_{\odot}$. Through a rigorous information criterion test, we show that broken power-law models accurately represent the redshift evolution of the concentration-mass relationship, and of the relative difference in the total mass of haloes induced by the presence of baryons. We provide the best-fit parameters of our empirical formulae, enabling their application to models that mimic baryonic effects in dark-matter-only simulations over six decades in halo mass in the redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;7$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Plane of Groups and Clusters of Galaxies: Distances and Peculiar Velocities of Superclusters of Galaxies on Small Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the work of Kopylova and Kopylov (2016) to build a fundamental plane (FP) of groups and clusters of galaxies -- here a sample of galaxies systems is increased from 94 to 172 objects. We have studied the ratios between the basic characteristics of groups and clusters of galaxies according to the archival data of SDSS, 2MASX and NED catalogs. Measured parameters ($\log L_K$, $\log R_e$ and $\log \sigma$) of clusters of galaxies determine the fundamental plane in the near infrared region: $L_K \propto R_e^{0.77\pm0.09} \sigma^{1.44\pm0.12}$. The form of the FP of groups/clusters is consistent with the FP of the early -- types of galaxies (SDSS, $r$-band) determined in the same way. Direct regression relative to the padius $\log r_e$ in the kpc gives a projection of the FP -- $\log R_e=0.98(\pm0.06)\,\log \sigma-0.56(\pm0.04)&lt;\log \langle I_e \rangle+3.57(\pm0.07)$, that can be used to determine the distances of the systems of galaxies. The root-mean-square deviation of the FP zero-point is 0.07 which is equal to the 16\% error in determining the distance of the group or cluster of galaxies. For the first time, we measured the peculiar velocities of the superclusters of galaxies. The mean peculiar velocity of the 5 superclusters of galaxies relative to the CMB is $+75\pm360$~km~s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. L. Calibration of the linear halo bias in $\Lambda(\nu)$CDM cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid mission, designed to map the geometry of the dark Universe, presents an unprecedented opportunity for advancing our understanding of the cosmos through its photometric galaxy cluster survey. This paper focuses on enhancing the precision of halo bias (HB) predictions, which is crucial for deriving cosmological constraints from the clustering of galaxy clusters. Our study is based on the peak-background split (PBS) model linked to the halo mass function (HMF); it extends with a parametric correction to precisely align with results from an extended set of $N$-body simulations carried out with the OpenGADGET3 code. Employing simulations with fixed and paired initial conditions, we meticulously analyze the matter-halo cross-spectrum and model its covariance using a large number of mock catalogs generated with Lagrangian Perturbation Theory simulations with the PINOCCHIO code. This ensures a comprehensive understanding of the uncertainties in our HB calibration. Our findings indicate that the calibrated HB model is remarkably resilient against changes in cosmological parameters including those involving massive neutrinos. The robustness and adaptability of our calibrated HB model provide an important contribution to the cosmological exploitation of the cluster surveys to be provided by the Euclid mission. This study highlights the necessity of continuously refining the calibration of cosmological tools like the HB to match the advancing quality of observational data. As we project the impact of our model on cosmological constraints, we find that, given the sensitivity of the Euclid survey, a miscalibration of the HB could introduce biases in cluster cosmology analyses. Our work fills this critical gap, ensuring the HB calibration matches the expected precision of the Euclid survey. The implementation of our model is publicly available in https://github.com/TiagoBsCastro/CCToolkit.</description>

      <title>Topological approach to void finding applied to the SDSS galaxy map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the low redshift Universe is dominated by a multi-scale void distribution delineated by filaments and walls of galaxies. The characteristics of voids; such as morphology, average density profile, and correlation function, can be used as cosmological probes. However, their physical properties are difficult to infer due to shot noise and the general lack of tracer particles used to define them. In this work, we construct a robust, topology-based void finding algorithm that utilizes Persistent Homology (PH) to detect persistent features in the data. We apply this approach to a volume limited sub-sample of galaxies in the SDSS I/II Main Galaxy catalog with the $r$-band absolute magnitude brighter than $M_r=-20.19$, and a set of mock catalogs constructed using the Horizon Run 4 cosmological $N$-body simulation. We measure the size distribution of voids, their averaged radial profile, sphericity, and the centroid nearest neighbor separation, using conservative values for the threshold and persistence. We find $32$ topologically robust voids in the SDSS data over the redshift range $0.02 \leq z \leq 0.116$, with effective radii in the range $21 - 56 \, h^{-1} \, {\rm Mpc}$. The median nearest neighbor void separation is found to be $\sim 57 \, h^{-1} \, {\rm Mpc}$, and the median radial void profile is consistent with the expected shape from the mock data.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Cosmic Magnification Reconstruction by Magnification Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic magnification on the observed galaxy overdensity is a promising weak gravitational lensing tracer. Current cosmic magnification reconstruction algorithms, ABS (Analytical method of Blind Separation) and cILC (constrained Internal Linear Combination), intend to disentangle the weak lensing signal using the magnification response in various flux bins. In this work, we reveal an unrecognized systematic bias arising from the difference between galaxy bias and the galaxy-lensing cross-correlation bias, due to the mismatch between the weak lensing kernel and the redshift distribution of photometric objects. It results into a galaxy-lensing degeneracy, which invalidates ABS as an exact solution. Based on the simulated cosmoDC2 galaxies, we verify that the recovered weak lensing amplitude by ABS is biased low by $\sim10\%$. cILC, including a modified version proposed here, also suffers from systematic bias of comparable amplitude. Combining flux and color information leads to significant reduction in statistical errors, but fails to eliminate the aforementioned bias. With the presence of this newly found systematic, it remains a severe challenge in blindly and robustly separating the cosmic magnification from the galaxy intrinsic clustering.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Statistical Inference in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques for statistical inference of parameters in cosmology. Given the importance of compressing the increasingly complex data vectors used in cosmology, we address questions that impact the constraining power achieved, such as: Are currently used methods effectively lossless? Under what conditions do nonlinear methods, typically based on neural nets, outperform linear methods? Through theoretical analysis and experiments with simulated weak lensing data vectors we compare three standard linear methods and neural network based methods. We propose two linear methods that outperform all others while using less computational resources: a variation of the MOPED algorithm we call e-MOPED and an adaptation of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which is a method new to cosmology but well known in statistics. Both e-MOPED and CCA utilize simulations spanning the full parameter space, and rely on the sensitivity of the data vector to the parameters of interest. The gains we obtain are significant compared to compression methods used in the literature: up to 30% in the Figure of Merit for $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ in a realistic Simulation Based Inference analysis that includes statistical and systematic errors. We also recommend two modifications that improve the performance of all methods: First, include components in the compressed data vector that may not target the key parameters but still enhance the constraints on due to their correlations. The gain is significant, above 20% in the Figure of Merit. Second, compress Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics separately -- we include two summary statistics of each type in our analysis.</description>

Abstract: We present a joint analysis of the CMB lensing power spectra measured from the Data Release 6 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Planck PR4, cross-correlations between the ACT and Planck lensing reconstruction and galaxy clustering from unWISE, and the unWISE clustering auto-spectrum. We obtain 1.5% constraints on the matter density fluctuations at late times parametrised by the best constrained parameter combination $S_8^{\rm 3x2pt}\equiv\sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.4}=0.815\pm0.012$. The commonly used $S_8\equiv\sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ parameter is constrained to $S_8=0.816\pm0.015$. In combination with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements we find $\sigma_8=0.815\pm 0.012$. We also present sound-horizon-independent estimates of the present day Hubble rate of $H_0=66.4^{+3.2}_{-3.7} \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ from our large scale structure data alone and $H_0=64.3^{+2.1}_{-2.4}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in combination with uncalibrated supernovae from Pantheon+. Using parametric estimates of the evolution of matter density fluctuations, we place constraints on cosmic structure in a range of high redshifts typically inaccessible with cross-correlation analyses. Combining lensing cross- and auto-correlations, we derive a 3.3% constraint on the integrated matter density fluctuations above $z=2.4$, one of the tightest constraints in this redshift range and fully consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM model fit to the primary CMB from Planck. Combining with primary CMB observations and using the extended low redshift coverage of these combined data sets we derive constraints on a variety of extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model including massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, and dark energy. We find in flat $\Lambda$CDM $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.12$ eV at 95% confidence using the LSS data, BAO measurements from SDSS and primary CMB observations.</description>

Abstract: Fifth force and equivalence principle tests search for new interactions by precisely measuring forces between macroscopic collections of atoms and molecules and their properties under free fall. In contrast, the early Universe plasma probes these interactions at a more fundamental level. In this paper, we consider the case of a scalar mediating a fifth force, and show that the effects of dimensional transmutation, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the running of the gauge couplings cause the scalar's low-energy interactions to mix, leading to nearly universal dynamics at early times. We use known expressions for the pressure of the Standard Model during its various epochs to compute the scalar effective potential, and find that the cosmological dynamics of this scalar are very sensitive to the reheat temperature of the Universe. Given the unknown reheat temperature, we show that scalar couplings to matter larger than $\sim 10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity produce the correct dark matter abundance, motivating new physics searches in this part of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Which gravitational lensing degeneracies are broken in wave-optics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies gravitational lensing degeneracies in the wave-optics regime, focusing on lensed gravitational waves (GWs). Considering lensing degeneracies as re-scaling (or transformations) of arrival time delay surface, we can divide them into local and global types. Local degeneracies only affect the time delay surface in localized regions, whereas global degeneracies re-scale the whole time delay surface by a constant while keeping the various observed image properties unchanged. We show that local degeneracies can be broken in the wave-optics regime since lensing effects become sensitive to the overall arrival time delay surface and not only to the time delay values at the image positions. On the other hand, global degeneracies (such as similarity transformation and mass-sheet degeneracy) multiply the amplification factor by a constant factor (let us say, $\lambda$). However, in GW lensing, as the GW signal amplitude depends on the source distance, it turns out that $\lambda$ is completely degenerate with the Hubble constant, similar to what we see in geometric optics. Hence, with the lensing of GWs, global degeneracies are as hard to break in wave optics as they are in geometric optics.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the $SO(9) \rightarrow SO(3) \times SO(6)$ Symmetry Breaking in the IKKT Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a dynamical mechanism which explains why in the supersymmetric IKKT matrix model the $SO(9)$ symmetry of the Lagrangian is spontaneously broken to $SO(3) \times SO(6)$, allowing only three large classical spatial dimensions to emerge. The argument relies on the identification of D1-strings as stable excitations of the matrices about the cosmological background, and the absence of forces between parallel D1-string excitations. A spatial dimension can only become large if the D1-strings winding that direction can annihilate. In the absence of forces, this requires the string world sheets to intersect, a process which is highly suppressed if more than three dimensions of space are large. Implications for a recently proposed matrix cosmology scenario are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tuning a PTA in the detection era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) transition into the detection era of the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), it is important for PTA collaborations to review, and possibly revise, their observing campaigns. The source of the GWB is unknown, and it may take years to pin down its nature. An astrophysical ensemble of supermassive binary black holes is one very likely source for the GWB. Evidence for such a background should come in the form of detectable anisotropies in the GWB and resolvable binary signals. A ``single source'' would be a boon for gravitational astrophysics, as such a source would emit gravitational waves for millions of years in the PTA frequency band. Earlier studies have shown that the observational strategies for finding single sources are somewhat different than for finding the statistical correlations needed for the detection of a stochastic background. Here we present generic methods for studying the effects of various observational strategies, taking advantage of detector sensitivity curves, i.e., noise-averaged, frequency-domain detection statistics. The statistical basis for these methods is presented along with myriad examples of how to tune a detector towards single, deterministic signals or a stochastic background. The importance of the uncorrelated half of the GWB, i.e. the pulsar-term, will be discussed as one of the most important sources of noise in the observational era of PTAs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting spins of primordial black holes in a matter-dominated era based on peak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the probability distribution for the spins of the primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed during an early matter-dominated era in the Universe. We employ the Zel'dovich approximation and focus on the linear-order effect of cosmological perturbations which causes the tidal torque. Assuming that the fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics, we apply the peak theory of random Gaussian variables to compute the root mean square (RMS) and the probability distribution of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ at their formation. The value of $a_{*}$ is evaluated through the angular momentum at the turn-around time. We find that the RMS $\bar{a}_{*}$ with a given amplitude of the fluctuation $\delta_{\rm{pk}}$ decreases with the amplitude. This behavior allows us to set the threshold value of the amplitude of the fluctuation through the under-extremal condition $\bar{a}_{*}&lt;1$. Then we discuss the impact of spin and anisotropic collapse on the production rate of PBHs. We find that, for $\sigma_{H}\leq 10^{-3}$ with $\sigma_{\rm H}$ being the square root of the variance of the fluctuation at the horizon reentry, the suppression from the spin effect is dominant, while the effect of anisotropy becomes more important for $\sigma_{H}&gt;10^{-3}$. Since $\bar{a}_{*}$ can be written as a function of $\nu:=\delta_{\rm{pk}}/\sigma_{\rm H}$, we can obtain the probability distribution of $\bar a_*$, $P(\bar a_*)$, through the probability distribution of $\nu$ characterized by a given power spectrum of the fluctuation. $P(\bar a_*)$ depends on $\sigma_{\rm H}$ and the parameter $\gamma$ that characterizes the width of the power spectrum. It is shown that, in the parameter regions of our interests, substantial values of PBH spins are expected in contrast to the PBH formation in a radiation-dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Different aspects of entropic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a short review of the recent developments of entropic cosmology based on two thermodynamic laws of the apparent horizon, namely the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. The first law essentially provides the change of the entropy of the apparent horizon during the cosmic evolution of the universe, in particular, it is given by: $TdS = -d(\rho V) + W dV$ (where $W$ is the work density and other quantities have their usual meaning). In this way, the first law actually links various theories of gravity with the entropy of the apparent horizon. This leads to a natural question -- ``what will be the form of the horizon entropy corresponding to a general modified theory of gravity?'' The second law of horizon thermodynamics states that the change of total entropy (the sum of horizon entropy $+$ matter fields' entropy) with respect to cosmic time must be positive, where the matter fields behave like an open system characterised by a non-zero chemical potential. The second law of horizon thermodynamics importantly provides model-independent constraints on entropic parameters. Finally, we discuss the standpoint of entropic cosmology on inflation (or bounce), reheating and primordial gravitational waves from the perspective of generalised entropy function.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the speed of sound on the gravitational wave power spectrum from sound waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future space-based interferometers offer an unprecedented opportunity to detect signals from the stochastic gravitational wave background originating from a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale. The phase transition is accompanied by a change of the equation of state from that of pure radiation. In this work we study the effect of this change on the power spectrum of gravitational waves generated by the sound waves in the plasma during the acoustic phase of the transition. We carry out an analytic calculation assuming that the sound speed and the fluid shear-stress that sources tensor perturbations remain approximately constant during the acoustic phase. The effect of a softer equation of state is twofold: (i) a scale-independent suppression of the power spectrum at all scales, due to the modified propagation of both sound and gravitational waves and (ii) the peak of the spectrum moves to smaller frequencies as the equation of state becomes softer. The power-law indices of the spectrum at small and large scales are unaffected by the softening of the equation of state. Our work improves the current estimation of the gravitational waves power spectrum from first order phase transitions and expands the possible scenarios of transitions that can be tested by gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Fluence distribution of statistically isotropic FERMI Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large-angle distribution of the gamma-ray bursts (GRB) from the updated FERMI/GBM catalogue, to probe the statistical isotropy of these astrophysical transient events. We also study the angular distribution of the GRB fluence, as a way to explore if this radiative feature shows some preferred direction on the sky that can suggest their origin. Our model-independent approach performs a directional analysis of the updated FERMI/GBM catalogue. The statistical significance of our results is obtained by comparison with a large set of statistically isotropic samples of cosmic objects, with the same features of the FERMI data. Our analyses confirm that the angular distribution of the FERMIGRB is statistically isotropic on the celestial sphere. Moreover, analysing the directional distribution of the FERMIGRB fluence, that is, the median GRB fluence in a set of directions that scans the celestial sphere, we found that this astrophysical property exhibits a net dipolar structure with a directional preference for latitudes near the galactic plane. However, additional studies show that this directional preference, indeed, is not correlated with the Milky Way galactic plane, suggesting that the GRB, and its fluence dipolar structure, are extra-galactic in origin. Interestingly, the analyses of the BATSE Channel 4 fluence data, that is, those GRB from BATSE with energy $&gt;$ 300 keV, reveal that its dipole direction is very well aligned with the cosmic microwave background dipole.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background due to core collapse resulting in neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic background of gravitational wave signals arising from the core-collapse supernovae is produced through various complex mechanisms that need detailed and careful investigation. We proposed a simplified multi-peak waveform of the amplitude spectrum. The corresponding energy spectra of our model fit the energy spectra obtained from different numerical simulations of various types of core-collapse events such as non-rotating, slow and fast rotating massive progenitors resulting in neutron stars. The maximum dimensionless energy density $\Omega_{gw}$ corresponding to our model is of $\mathcal{O}(10 {^{-12})} $ around 650 Hz. Assuming some degree of uncertainty, we estimated the parameters for the core collapse waveform using BILBY. We studied the detectability of the signal of our model against gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope, advanced LIGO and Virgo. Our study indicates that these detectors have to gain more sensitivity to pick up the gravitational wave signals of stochastic background.</description>

      <title>Merging cosmologically coupled black holes: stochastic gravitational wave background and implications for pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that realistic models of (singularity-free) black holes (BHs) embedded within an expanding Universe are coupled to the large-scale cosmological dynamics, with striking consequences, including pure cosmological growth of BH masses. We examine the consequences of this growth for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by merging supermassive cosmologically coupled BHs. We show that the predicted SGWB amplitude is enhanced relative to the standard uncoupled case, while maintaining the $\Omega_{\text{gw}} \propto f^{2/3}$ frequency scaling of the spectral energy density. For the case where BH masses grow with scale factor as $M_{\text{bh}} \propto a^3$, thus contributing as a dark energy component to the cosmological dynamics, the enhancement factor can exceed an order of magnitude. This has important consequences for the SGWB signal detected by pulsar timing arrays, whose measured amplitude is slightly larger than most theoretical predictions for the spectrum from binary BH mergers, a discrepancy which can be alleviated by the cosmological mass growth mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed through the gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations that were generated and stretched during the inflationary era, later entering the cosmological horizon during the decelerating phase, if their amplitudes were sufficiently large. In this article, I will briefly introduce the basic concept of PBHs and review the formation dynamics through this mechanism, the estimation of the initial spins of PBHs and the time evolution of type II fluctuations, with a focus on the radiation-dominated and (early) matter-dominated phases.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting scalar dark matter around binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can provide crucial insights about the environments in which black holes live. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations to study the behaviour of self-interacting scalar (wave-like) dark matter clouds accreting onto isolated and binary black holes. We find that repulsive self-interactions smoothen the ``spike'' of an isolated black hole and saturate the density. Attractive self-interactions enhance the growth and result in more cuspy profiles, but can become unstable and undergo explosions akin to the superradiant bosenova that reduce the local cloud density. We quantify the impact of self-interactions on an equal-mass black hole merger by computing the dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal for a range of couplings. We find that repulsive self-interactions saturate the density of the cloud, thereby reducing the dephasing. For attractive self-interactions, the dephasing may be larger, but if these interactions dominate prior to the merger, the dark matter can undergo bosenova during the inspiral phase, disrupting the cloud and subsequently reducing the dephasing.</description>

      <title>Fragments of harmony amid apparent chaos: a closer look at the X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions of the galaxy RX J1301.9+2747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are an extreme X-ray variability phenomenon associated with low-mass supermassive black holes. First discovered in the nucleus of the galaxy GSN 069, they have been so far securely detected in five other galaxies, including RX J1301.9+2747. When detected, the out-of-QPE emission (quiescence) is consistent with the high-energy tail of thermal emission from an accretion disk. We present the X-ray and radio properties of RX J1301.9+2747, both in quiescence and during QPEs. We analyse X-ray data taken during five XMM-Newton observations between 2000 and 2022. The last three observations were taken in coordination with radio observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We also make use of EXOSAT, ROSAT, and Chandra archival observations taken between 1983 and 2009. XMM-Newton detected 34 QPEs of which 8 have significantly lower amplitudes than the others. No correlated radio/X-ray variability was observed during QPEs. In terms of timing properties, the QPEs in RX J1301.9+2747 do not exhibit the striking regularity observed in the discovery source GSN 069. In fact there is no clear repetition pattern between QPEs: the average time separation between their peaks is about four hours, but it can be as short as one, and as long as six hours. The QPE spectral properties of RX J1301.9+2747 as a function of energy are however very similar to those of GSN 069 and of other QPE sources. The quiescent emission of RX J1301.9+2747 is more complex than that of GSN 069, as it requires a soft X-ray excess-like component in addition to the thermal emission from the accretion disk. Its long-term X-ray quiescent flux variations are of low-amplitude and not strictly monotonic, with a general decay over $\sim 22$ years. We discuss our observational results in terms of some of the ideas and models that have been proposed so far for the physical origin of QPEs.</description>

Abstract: This review is an up-to-date account of the use of numerical relativity to study dynamical, strong-gravity environments in a cosmological context. First, we provide a gentle introduction into the use of numerical relativity in solving cosmological spacetimes, aimed at both cosmologists and numerical relativists. Second, we survey the present body of work, focusing on general relativistic simulations without approximations, organised according to the cosmological history -- from cosmogenesis, through the early hot Big Bang, to the late-time evolution of universe. In both cases, we discuss the present state-of-the-art, and suggest directions in which future work can be fruitfully pursued.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Excluding Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Based on Solar System Ephemeris"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2408.10799) that solar system ephemeris data can exclude primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the mass range $10^{18}$-$10^{22}\,$g. We show that this conclusion is based on an implausible, implicit assumption; namely the uncertainty on the solar system mass within 50 au is as small as the uncertainty on the mass of the sun. Correcting for this error, we find that ephemeris data can only constrain PBH's with mass below $10^{16}\,$g, which is already excluded by constraints on their evaporation via Hawking radiation. Correcting a further error concerning the time-averaged rate of such fluctuations nullifies even this weaker constraint.</description>

      <title>Implications of first neutrino-induced nuclear recoil measurements in direct detection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PandaX-4T and XENONnT have recently reported the first measurement of nuclear recoils induced by the $^8$B solar neutrino flux, through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) channel. As long anticipated, this is an important milestone for dark matter searches as well as for neutrino physics. This measurement means that these detectors have reached exposures such that searches for low mass, $\lesssim 10$ GeV dark matter cannot be analyzed using the background-free paradigm going forward. It also opens a new era for these detectors to be used as neutrino observatories. In this paper we assess the sensitivity of these new measurements to new physics in the neutrino sector. We focus on neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) and show that -- despite the still moderately low statistical significance of the signals -- these data already provide valuable information. We find that limits on NSI from PandaX-4T and XENONnT measurements are comparable to those derived using combined COHERENT CsI and LAr data, as well as those including the latest Ge measurement. Furthermore, they provide sensitivity to pure $\tau$ flavor parameters that are not accessible using stopped-pion or reactor sources. With further improvements of statistical uncertainties as well as larger exposures, forthcoming data from these experiments will provide important, novel results for CE$\nu$NS-related physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The era of gravitational wave astronomy began in 2015 with the observation of the signal from the merger of two black holes by the LIGO detectors; by 2021, almost 100 more such transient signals from coalescences of compact binaries of black holes and neutron stars were catalogued. With improvements to the ground-based interferometer network consisting of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA now promising to bring the total number of detections into the hundreds, we review the observational signatures and analysis methods for the most prolific gravitational-wave source: the coalescence of compact binaries.</description>

      <title>Spectral Representation of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions are significantly more complex than their flat-space analogues, such as tree-level scattering amplitudes. While these amplitudes have simple analytic structure and clear factorisation properties, cosmological correlators often feature branch cuts and lack neat expressions. In this paper, we develop off-shell perturbative methods to study and compute cosmological correlators. We show that such approach not only makes the origin of the correlator singularity structure and factorisation manifest, but also renders practical analytical computations more tractable. Using a spectral representation of massive cosmological propagators that encodes particle production through a suitable $i\epsilon$ prescription, we remove the need to ever perform nested time integrals as they only appear in a factorised form. This approach explicitly shows that complex correlators are constructed by gluing lower-point off-shell correlators, while performing the spectral integral sets the exchanged particles on shell. Notably, in the complex mass plane instead of energy, computing spectral integrals amounts to collecting towers of poles as the simple building blocks are meromorphic functions. We demonstrate this by deriving a new, simple, and partially resummed representation for the four-point function of conformally coupled scalars mediated by tree-level massive scalar exchange in de Sitter. Additionally, we establish cosmological largest-time equations that relate different channels on in-in branches via analytic continuation, analogous to crossing symmetry in flat space. These universal relations provide simple consistency checks and suggest that dispersive methods hold promise for developing cosmological recursion relations, further connecting techniques from modern scattering amplitudes to cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have unveiled several galaxies with stellar masses $M_*\gtrsim10^{10} M_\odot$ at redshifts $7.4\lesssim z\lesssim 9.1$. These remarkable findings indicate an unexpectedly high stellar mass density, which contradicts the prediction of the $\Lambda \rm CDM$ model. Our study utilizes the Chevallier--Polarski--Linder (CPL) parameterization, one of the dynamic dark energy models, to probe the role of dark energy on shaping galaxy formation. By considering varying star formation efficiencies within this framework, our analysis demonstrates that in a universe with a higher proportion of dark energy, more massive galaxies are formed at high redshifts, given a fixed perturbation amplitude observed today. These intriguing results highlight the promising prospect of revealing the nature of dark energy by analyzing the high-redshift massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Addressing type Ia supernova color variability with a linear spectral template</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) provided the first evidence of an accelerated expansion of the universe and remain a valuable probe to cosmology. They are deemed standardizable candles due to the observed correlations between its luminosity and photometric quantities. This characteristic can be exploited to estimate cosmological distances after accounting for the observed variations. There is however a remaining dispersion unaccounted for in the current state-of-the-art standardization methods. In an attempt to explore this issue, we propose a simple linear 3-component rest-frame flux description for a light-curve fitter. Since SNIa intrinsic color index variations are expected to be time-dependent, our description builds-up upon the mathematical expression of the well known SALT2 for rest-frame flux, whilst we drop the exponential factor and add an extra model component with time and wavelength dependencies. The model components are obtained by performing either Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Factor Analysis (FA) onto a representative training set. The constraining power of the Pure Expansion Template for Supernovae (PETS), is evaluated and we found compatible results with SALT2 for $\Omega_{m0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda 0}$ within 68% uncertainty between the two models, with PETS' fit parameters exhibiting non negligible linear correlations with SALT2' parameters. For both model versions we verified that the first component describes mainly color index variations, as a dominant effect on SNIa spectra. The model nuisance parameter which multiplies the color index variation-like fit parameter shows evolution with redshift in an initial binned cosmology analysis. This behavior can be due to selection effects. Overall, our model shows promise, as there are still a few aspects to be refined; however, it still falls short in reducing the unaccounted dispersion.</description>

      <title>Generating mock galaxy catalogues for flux-limited samples like the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate mock galaxy catalogues are crucial to validate analysis pipelines used to constrain dark energy models. We present a fast HOD-fitting method which we apply to the AbacusSummit simulations to create a set of mock catalogues for the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey, which contain r-band magnitudes and g-r colours. The halo tabulation method fits HODs for different absolute magnitude threshold samples simultaneously, preventing unphysical HOD crossing between samples. We validate the HOD fitting procedure by fitting to real-space clustering measurements and galaxy number densities from the MXXL BGS mock, which was tuned to the SDSS and GAMA surveys. The best-fitting clustering measurements and number densities are mostly within the assumed errors, but the clustering for the faint samples is low on large scales. The best-fitting HOD parameters are robust when fitting to simulations with different realisations of the initial conditions. When varying the cosmology, trends are seen as a function of each cosmological parameter. We use the best-fitting HOD parameters to create cubic box and cut sky mocks from the AbacusSummit simulations, in a range of cosmologies. As an illustration, we compare the Mr&lt;-20 sample of galaxies in the mock with BGS measurements from the DESI one-percent survey. We find good agreement in the number densities, and the projected correlation function is reasonable, with differences that can be improved in the future by fitting directly to BGS clustering measurements. The cubic box and cut-sky mocks in different cosmologies are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Understanding spectral artefacts in SKA-LOW 21-cm cosmology experiments: the impact of cable reflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Dawn was marked by the formation of the first stars, and preceded the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), when the Universe underwent a fundamental transformation caused by the radiation from these first stars and galaxies. Interferometric 21-cm experiments aim to probe redshifted neutral hydrogen signals from these periods, constraining the conditions of the early Universe. The SKA-Low instrument of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is envisaged to be the largest and most sensitive radio telescope at metre and centimetre wavelengths. The latest Aperture Array Verification Systems feature 7-m coaxial transmission lines connecting the low noise amplifiers to optical transmitters at the front of the analogue-receiving chain. An impedance mismatch between these components results in a partially reflected electromagnetic signal, introducing chromatic aberrations into the instrument bandpass. This causes power from the foreground signals to appear at higher delays, potentially contaminating the 'EoR window', a region in which the 21-cm signal should be detectable. We present an end-to-end simulation pipeline for SKA-Low using a composite sky model combining radio foregrounds from the Galactic and Extragalactic All-Sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey, Haslam $408\,$MHz, and a 1.5-cGpc 21-cm brightness temperature cube generated with the 21cmSPACE simulator. We derive a model for the scattering parameters of a coaxial transmission line in terms of its specifications and bulk material properties. Assuming identical cables of length $\leq 15.0\,$m with impedance mismatch $\leq 10\, \Omega$, the reflection is confined below the EoR window. However, we demonstrate that even a 0.1 per cent length tolerance introduces contamination with an absolute fractional difference of $\sim 10$ per cent across all accessible k-modes.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Radiative Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition due to the effects of one-loop radiative corrections of Yukawa couplings between the inflaton and a dark fermion in a non-supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model. We obtain a spectral index $n_s$, and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, consistent with the current Planck data. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire dark matter (DM) candidate of the universe or a fraction of it. Our predictions are consistent with any existing constraints of PBH from microlensing, BBN, CMB, etc. Moreover, the scenario is also testable via induced gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order scalar perturbations detectable in future observatories such as LISA and ET. For instance, with inflaton mass $m \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $m_N \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV, we obtain PBHs of around $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ mass that can explain the entire abundance of DM and predict GWs with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ with peak frequency $f$ $\sim$ $0.1$ Hz in LISA. By explicitly estimating fine-tuning we show that the model has very mild tuning. We discuss successful reheating at the end of the inflationary phase via the conversion of the waterfall field into standard model (SM) particles. We also briefly speculate a scenario where the dark fermion can be a possible heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) which is responsible for generating the SM neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The RHN can be produced due to waterfall field decay and its subsequent decay may also explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis. We find the reheat temperature $T_R\lesssim5\times10^9$~GeV that explains the matter-anti-matter asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a multifield dark energy model with a nonflat field-space metric, in which one field is dynamical while the others have constant spatial gradients. The model is predictive at the background level, leading to an early dark energy component at high redshifts and a suppressed fraction of late-time anisotropy. Both features have simple expressions in terms of the curvature scale of the field-space, and correspond to stable points in the phase space of possible solutions. Because of the coupling between time and space-dependent scalar fields, vector field perturbations develop tachyonic instabilities at scales below the Hubble radius, thus being potentially observable in the number count of galaxies. Overall, the presence of a nontrivial field-space curvature also leads to the appearance of instabilities on scalar perturbations, which can impact the matter density distribution at large scales.</description>

      <title>Numerical challenges for energy conservation in N-body simulations of collapsing self-interacting dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) halos can be subject to gravothermal collapse if the DM is not collisionless, but engaged in strong self-interactions. When the scattering can efficiently transfer heat from the centre to the outskirts, the central region of the halo collapses and reaches densities much higher than those for collisionless DM. This phenomenon is potentially observable in studies of strong lensing. Current theoretical efforts are motivated by observations of surprisingly dense substructures. A comparison with observations requires accurate predictions. One method to obtain such predictions is to use N-body simulations. Collapsed halos are extreme systems that pose challenges when applying state-of-the-art codes to model self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We investigate the root of such problems, with a focus on energy non-conservation and discuss possible strategies to avoid them. We ran N-body simulations, with and without SIDM, of an isolated DM-only halo and we adjusted the numerical parameters to check the accuracy of the simulation. We find that not only the numerical scheme for SIDM can lead to energy non-conservation, but also the modelling of gravitational interaction and the time integration are problematic. The issues we find are: (a) particles changing their time step in a non-time-reversible manner; (b) the asymmetry in the tree-based gravitational force evaluation; and (c) SIDM velocity kicks breaking the time symmetry. Tuning the parameters of the simulation allows us to conserve energy not only at early stages of the evolution, but also later on. However, the cost of the simulations becomes prohibitively large. Some of the problems that make the simulations of the gravothermal collapse phase inaccurate can be overcome by choosing appropriate numerical schemes. However, other issues still pose a challenge. Our findings motivate further works on addressing these challenges.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects due to mismatches in passbands, polarization angles, and temperature and polarization calibrations in the context of the upcoming cosmic microwave background experiment Simons Observatory (SO). Using the SO multi-frequency likelihood, we estimate the bias and the degradation of constraining power in cosmological and astrophysical foreground parameters assuming different levels of knowledge of the instrumental effects. We find that incorrect but reasonable assumptions about the values of all the systematics examined here can have significant effects on cosmological analyses, hence requiring marginalization approaches at the likelihood level. When doing so, we find that the most relevant effect is due to bandpass shifts. When marginalizing over them, the posteriors of parameters describing astrophysical microwave foregrounds (such as radio point sources or dust) get degraded, while cosmological parameters constraints are not significantly affected. Marginalization over polarization angles with up to 0.25$^\circ$ uncertainty causes an irrelevant bias $\lesssim 0.05 \sigma$ in all parameters. Marginalization over calibration factors in polarization broadens the constraints on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff}$ by a factor 1.2, interpreted here as a proxy parameter for non standard model physics targeted by high-resolution CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>Can the splashback radius be an observable boundary of galaxy clusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The splashback radius was proposed as a physically motivated boundary of clusters as it sets the limit between the infalling and the orbitally dominated regions. However, galaxy clusters are complex objects connected to filaments of the cosmic web from which they accrete matter that disturbs them and modifies their morphology. In this context, estimating the splashback radius and the cluster boundary becomes challenging. In this work, we use a constrained hydrodynamical simulation of the Virgo cluster's replica embedded in its large-scale structure to investigate the impact of its local environment on the splashback radius estimate. We identify the splashback radius from 3D radial profiles of dark matter density, baryons density, and pressure in three regions representative of different dynamical states: accretion from spherical collapse, filaments, and matter outflow. We also identify the splashback radius from 2D-projected radial profiles of observation-like quantities: mass surface density, emission measure, and Compton-y. We show that the splashback radius mainly depends on the dynamics in each region and the physical processes traced by the different probes. We find multiple values for the splashback radius ranging from 3.3$\pm$0.2 to 5.5$\pm$0.3 Mpc. Particularly, in the regions of collapsing and outflowing material, the splashback radii estimated from baryon density and pressure radial profiles overestimate that of the dark matter density profiles, which is considered the reference value originally defined from dark matter simulations. Consequently, caution is required when using the splashback radius as a boundary of clusters, particularly in the case of highly disturbed clusters like Virgo. We also discuss the detection of the splashback radius from pressure radial profiles, which could be more related to an accretion shock, and its detection from stacked radial profiles.</description>

      <title>High redshift LBGs from deep broadband imaging for future spectroscopic surveys</title>

Abstract: Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) are promising probes for clustering measurements at high redshift, $z&gt;2$, a region only covered so far by Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of selecting LBGs by exploiting the existence of a strong deficit of flux shortward of the Lyman limit, due to various absorption processes along the line of sight. The target selection relies on deep imaging data from the HSC and CLAUDS surveys in the $g,r,z$ and $u$ bands, respectively, with median depths reaching 27 AB in all bands. The selections were validated by several dedicated spectroscopic observation campaigns with DESI. Visual inspection of spectra has enabled us to develop an automated spectroscopic typing and redshift estimation algorithm specific to LBGs. Based on these data and tools, we assess the efficiency and purity of target selections optimised for different purposes. Selections providing a wide redshift coverage retain $57\%$ of the observed targets after spectroscopic confirmation with DESI, and provide an efficiency for LBGs of $83\pm3\%$, for a purity of the selected LBG sample of $90\pm2\%$. This would deliver a confirmed LBG density of $\sim 620$ deg$^{-2}$ in the range $2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5$ for a $r$-band limiting magnitude $r&lt;24.2$. Selections optimised for high redshift efficiency retain $73\%$ of the observed targets after spectroscopic confirmation, with $89\pm4\%$ efficiency for $97\pm2\%$ purity. This would provide a confirmed LBG density of $\sim 470$ deg$^{-2}$ in the range $2.8&lt;z&lt;3.5$ for a $r$-band limiting magnitude $r&lt;24.5$. A preliminary study of the LBG sample 3d-clustering properties is also presented and used to estimate the LBG linear bias. A value of $b_{LBG} = 3.3 \pm 0.2 (stat.)$ is obtained for a mean redshift of 2.9 and a limiting magnitude in $r$ of 24.2, in agreement with results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Cosmological Parameter Inference from Dark Matter Halo Density Field</title>

Abstract: We propose a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (lCNN) to estimate cosmological parameters from simulated three-dimensional DM halo distributions and associated statistics. The training dataset comprises 2000 realizations of a cubic box with a side length of 1000 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, and interpolated over a cubic grid of $300^3$ voxels, with each simulation produced using $512^3$ DM particles and $512^3$ neutrinos . Under the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, simulations vary standard six cosmological parameters including $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $w$, along with the neutrino mass sum, $M_\nu$. We find that: 1) within the framework of lCNN, extracting large-scale structure information is more efficient from the halo density field compared to relying on the statistical quantities including the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, and the coefficients from wavelet scattering transform; 2) combining the halo density field with its Fourier transformed counterpart enhances predictions, while augmenting the training dataset with measured statistics further improves performance; 3) achieving high accuracy in inferring $\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sigma_8$ by the neural network model, while being inefficient in predicting $\Omega_b$,$M_\nu$ and $w$; 4) compared to the simple random forest network trained with three statistical quantities, lCNN yields unbiased estimations with reduced statistical errors: approximately 33.3\% for $\Omega_m$, 20.0\% for $h$, 8.3\% for $n_s$, and 40.0\% for $\sigma_8$. Our study emphasizes this lCNN-based novel approach in extracting large-scale structure information and estimating cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Observations of Galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ Allow to Test Cosmological Models with Features in the Initial Power Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial power spectrum of density perturbations, generated during the inflationary epoch, is now constrained by observations on scales $\lambda&gt;5$~Mpc and has a power-law form. The peculiarities of the inflationary process can lead to the appearance of non-power-law contributions to this spectrum, such as peaks. The exact size and shape of the peak cannot be predicted in advance. In this paper, we propose methods for searching for such peaks in the region of the spectrum with $\lambda&lt;5$~Mpc. Perturbations on these scales enter the nonlinear stage at $z\gtrsim10$, which is now becoming accessible to observations. Our studies of numerical models of large-scale structure with peaks in the initial spectrum have shown that spectral features on scales with $\lambda&gt;0.1$~Mpc manifest in the clustering of galaxies, as well as affect their mass function, sizes, and density. Studying these characteristics of distant galaxies will allow us to constrain cosmological models with peaks.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Peculiar velocities impact on the Hubble diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SNe Ia are used to determine the distance-redshift relation and build the Hubble diagram. Neglecting their host-galaxy peculiar velocities (PVs) may bias the measurement of cosmological parameters. The smaller the redshift, the larger the effect is. We use realistic simulations of SNe Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to investigate the effect of different methods to take into account PVs. We study the impact of neglecting galaxy PVs and their correlations in an analysis of the SNe Ia Hubble diagram. We find that it is necessary to use the PV full covariance matrix computed from the velocity power spectrum to take into account the sample variance. Considering the results we have obtained using simulations, we determine the PV systematic effects in the context of the ZTF DR2 SNe Ia sample. We determine the PV impact on the intercept of the Hubble diagram, $a_B$, which is directly linked to the measurement of $H_0$. We show that not taking into account PVs and their correlations results in a shift of the $H_0$ value of about $1.0$km.s$^{-1}$.Mpc$^{-1}$ and a slight underestimation of the $H_0$ error bar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters of the $k$-essence scalar field model with inverse square and exponential potentials using data sets including Pantheon+SHOES and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from SDSS and DESI surveys, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter and redshift obtained from the differential age method (CC). We also provide a brief perspective on the dynamical evolution of both models and derive stability constraints on the model parameters, which are then used to set appropriate priors. We adopt a Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best fit the data. A comprehensive analysis in light of observational data shows that the $k$-essence model fits well across all data combinations. However, according to the BIC criterion, the $\Lambda$CDM model provides a slightly better fit compared to the $k$-essence model.</description>

      <title>The impact of constrained interacting dark energy on the bound-zone velocity profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the effects of constrained interacting dark energy (CIDER) on the bound-zone velocity profiles around massive dark matter halos. Analyzing the CIDER simulations performed by Baldi (2023) for three different cases of dark sector coupling ($\beta=0.03$, $0.05$ and $0.08$) as well as for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology ($\beta=0$), we determine the mean peculiar velocity profiles in the bound zones around the friends-of-friends halos with masses larger than $M_{\rm cut}=3\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at three redshifts, $z=0$, $0.5$ and $1$. It is found that the universal power-law formula proposed by Falco et al. (2024) originally for the $\Lambda$CDM case still describes well the bound-zone velocity profiles, $V(r)$, even in the CIDER models. The slope of $V(r)$, turns out to be significantly affected by the CIDER, progressively decreasing as $\beta$ increases. Meanwhile, the amplitude of $V(r)$ exhibits little dependence on $\beta$, which is ascribed to the identical Hubble parameters shared by the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models in the entire redshift range. Our results imply that the bound-zone velocity slope can break a degeneracy even between the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models with $\beta\le 0.03$, which the standard cosmological diagnostics fail to distinguish. We devise a simple analytic formula for the bound-zone slope as a function of $\beta$, and prove its validity at all of the three redshifts. It is concluded that the slope of the mean bound-zone peculiar velocity profile should be in principle a powerful probe of dark sector interaction.</description>

Abstract: Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is split in two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements sample comprising of 20 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements sample including 33 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These 33 measurements are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between the two samples. The distance ladder-based sample yields a best fit $H_0 = 72.8 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=0.51$ indicating some correlations. The one-step measurements result in $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.48$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=1.37$ indicating some internal tension. If two outlier measurements are removed (TDCOSMO.I-2019 known to have systematics and MCP-2020) the best fit of the one step sample reduces to $H_0 = 68.3 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=0.95$, fully self-consistent and consistent with sound horizon based measurements. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.0001 suggesting that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early and late-time measurements, but between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Detection of gamma-ray burst Amati relation based on Hubble data set and Pantheon+ samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using gamma-ray bursts as standard candles for cosmological parameter constraints rely on their empirical luminosity relations and low-redshift calibration. In this paper, we examine the Amati relation and its potential corrections based on the A118 sample of higher-quality gamma-ray bursts, using both Hubble data set and Pantheon+ samples as calibration samples in the redshift range of z &lt; 1.965. In calibrating gamma-ray bursts using these two datasets, we employ Gaussian processes to obtain corresponding Hubble diagrams to avoid the dependence on cosmological models in the calibration process. We first divided the low-redshift sample of GRBs into two bins and examined the Amati relation and its potential modifications. We found that under both calibrations, the Amati relation did not show evidence of redshift evolution (68% confidence level). For the other two Amati relations that include redshift evolution terms, the central values of the redshift evolution coefficients deviated from 0, but due to the limitations of the sample size and the increase in the number of parameters, most of the redshift evolution coefficients were not able to be excluded from 0 at the 1 sigma level. Therefore, to assess their situation across the entire redshift range, we employed MCMC to globally fit three types of Amati relations. By computing AIC and BIC, we found that for the GRB A118 sample, the standard Amati relation remains the most fitting empirical luminosity formula, and no potential redshift evolution trend was observed for two different low-redshift calibrating sources.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Network: A Dual Solution for Gravitational Waves and Hubble Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that domain wall networks generate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) observed as a strong common power-law process in the Data Release-2 of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We find that a broad range of parameters, specifically wall tension around $\sigma_{\textrm{DW}} \sim (29-414 , \textrm{TeV})^3$ and wall-decay temperature within $T_d \sim 20-257 , \textrm{MeV}$, can explain this phenomenon at a $68\%$ credible level. Meanwhile, the same parameters could ease the Hubble tension if particles from these domain wall networks decay into dark radiation. We establish a direct analytical relationship, $\Omega_{\textrm{GW}}(f_p,T_0) h^2 \sim \Omega_{\textrm{rad}} h^2 ( \Omega_\nu \Delta N_{\textrm{eff}})^2$, to illustrate this coincidence, underlining its importance in the underlying physics and potential applicability to a wider range of models and data. Conversely, if the common power-law process is not attributed to domain wall networks, our findings impose tight limits on the wall tension and decay temperature.</description>

      <title>Filamentary Dust Polarization and the Morphology of Neutral Hydrogen Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filamentary structures in neutral hydrogen (HI) emission are well aligned with the interstellar magnetic field, so HI emission morphology can be used to construct templates that strongly correlate with measurements of polarized thermal dust emission. We explore how the quantification of filament morphology affects this correlation. We introduce a new implementation of the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) using spherical harmonic convolutions, which enables efficient quantification of filamentary structure on the sphere. We use this Spherical RHT algorithm along with a Hessian-based method to construct HI-based polarization templates. We discuss improvements to each algorithm relative to similar implementations in the literature and compare their outputs. By exploring the parameter space of filament morphologies with the Spherical RHT, we find that the most informative HI structures for modeling the magnetic field structure are the thinnest resolved filaments. For this reason, we find a $\sim10\%$ enhancement in the $B$-mode correlation with polarized dust emission with higher-resolution HI observations. We demonstrate that certain interstellar morphologies can produce parity-violating signatures, i.e., nonzero $TB$ and $EB$, even under the assumption that filaments are locally aligned with the magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate that $B$ modes from interstellar dust filaments are mostly affected by the topology of the filaments with respect to one another and their relative polarized intensities, whereas $E$ modes are mostly sensitive to the shapes of individual filaments.</description>

      <title>Coleman-Weinberg dynamics of ultralight scalar dark matter and GeV-scale right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model by three singlet fermions and one singlet real scalar field. The scalar is an ultralight dark matter candidate whose abundance is set by dynamically induced misalignment from the Higgs portal. We focus on parameter space where the Coleman-Weinberg potential both fixes the dark matter relic abundance, and predicts the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos. The model prefers scalar masses in the range of $10 ~{\rm {\mu}eV} \lesssim m_{\phi} \lesssim 10 ~{\rm meV}$, and can be tested via direct searches for a light scalar (e.g. fifth force tests), or by searching for right-handed neutrinos in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Uncertainty of Cosmological First Order Phase Transitions with Numerical Simulations of Bubble Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to study the validity of analytical formulas used in the calculation of characteristic physical quantities related to vacuum bubbles, we conduct several numerical simulations of bubble kinematics in the context of cosmological first-order phase transitions to determine potentially existing systematic uncertainties. By comparing with the analytical results, we obtain the following observations: (1) The simulated false vacuum fraction will approach the theoretical one with increasing simulated volume. When the side length of the cubic simulation volume becomes larger than 14.5 $\beta_{th}^{-1}$ , the simulated results do not change significantly; (2) The theoretical expected total number of bubbles do not agree with the simulated ones, which may be caused by the inconsistent use of the false vacuum fraction formula; (3) The different nucleation rate prefactors do not affect the bubble kinetics much; (4) The lifetime distribution in the sound shell model does not obey an exponential distribution, in such a way as to cause a suppression in the gravitational wave spectra.</description>

      <title>Imprints of the Local Bubble and Dust Complexity on Polarized Dust Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using 3D dust maps and Planck polarized dust emission data, we investigate the influence of the 3D geometry of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the statistics of the dust polarization on large ($80'$) scales. We test recent models that assume that the magnetic field probed by the polarized dust emission is preferentially tangential to the Local Bubble wall, but we do not find an imprint of the Local Bubble geometry on the dust polarization fraction. We also test the hypothesis that the complexity of the 3D dust distribution drives some of the measured variation of the dust polarization fraction. We compare sightlines with similar total column densities and find that, on average, the dust polarization fraction decreases when the dust column is substantially distributed among multiple components at different distances. Conversely, the dust polarization fraction is higher for sightlines where the dust is more concentrated in 3D space. This finding is statistically significant for the dust within 1.25 kpc, but the effect disappears if we only consider dust within 270 pc. In conclusion, we find that the extended 3D dust distribution, rather than solely the dust associated with the Local Bubble, plays a role in determining the observed dust polarization fraction at 80$'$. This conclusion is consistent with a simple analytical prediction and remains robust under various modifications to the analysis. These results illuminate the relationship between the 3D geometry of the ISM and tracers of the interstellar magnetic field. We discuss implications for our understanding of the polarized dust foreground to the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the thin accretion disk behaviors surrounding black holes embedded in cold dark matter halos and scalar field dark matter halos. We first calculate the event horizons and derive the equations of motion and effective potential in black hole geometries with different dark matter halos. We then compute the specific energy, specific angular momentum, and angular velocity of particles moving along circular orbits. We also derive the effective potentials to find the locations of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and compare them to the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes without the dark matter haloes. We also use the observed ISCO of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, to constrain the dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>A Multiverse Outside of the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Multiverse can arise from landscapes without de Sitter minima. It can be populated during a period of eternal inflation without trans-Planckian field excursions and without flat potentials. This Multiverse can explain the values of the cosmological constant and of the weak scale. In the process of proving these statements we derive a few simple, but counter-intuitive results. We show that it is easy to write models of eternal inflation compatible with the distance and refined de Sitter conjectures. Secondly, tunneling transitions that move fields from a lower-energy vacuum to a higher-energy vacuum and generate baby Universes are possible, and occur during eternal inflation. Finally, we relax the assumption of no de Sitter minima and show that this more standard Multiverse can be populated by Coleman-De Luccia transitions in about 100 $e$-folds of inflation.</description>

      <title>Primordial monopoles, black holes and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how topologically stable superheavy magnetic monopoles and primordial black holes can be generated at observable levels by the waterfall field in hybrid inflation models based on grand unified theories. In $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ grand unification, the monopole mass is of order $4 \times 10^{17}$ GeV, and it carries a single unit ($2 \pi /e$) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as screened color magnetic charge. The monopole density is partially diluted to an observable value, and accompanied with the production of primordial black holes with mass of order $10^{17}$-$10^{19}$ g which may make up the entire dark matter in the universe. The tensor to scalar ratio $r$ is predicted to be of order $10^{-5}$ - $10^{-4}$ which should be testable in the next generation of CMB experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. The gravitational wave spectrum generated during the waterfall transition is also presented. The observed baryon asymmetry can be explained via leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Radial Profile of Galactic Magnetic Fields using Rotation Measure of Background Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing magnetic fields in high-redshift galactic systems is crucial to investigate galactic dynamics and evolution. Utilizing the rotation measure of the background quasars, we have developed a radial profile of the magnetic field in a typical high-$z$ galaxy. We have compiled a catalog of 59 confirmed quasar sightlines, having one intervening Mg \rom{2} absorber in the redshift range $0.372\leq z_{\text{abs}} \leq 0.8$. The presence of the foreground galaxy is ensured by comparing the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts within $3 \sigma_{z-\text{photo}}$ and visual checks. These quasar line-of-sights (LoS) pass through various impact parameters (D) up to $160$ kpc, covering the circumgalactic medium of a typical Milky-Way type galaxy. Utilizing the residual rotation measure (RRM) of these sightlines, we estimated the excess in RRM dispersion, $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$. We found $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ decreases with increasing D. We translated $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ to average LoS magnetic field strength, $\langle B_{\|}\rangle$ by considering a typical electron column density. Consequently, the decreasing trend is sustained in the magnetic field. In particular for sightlines with $\text{D} \leq 50$ kpc and $\text{D} &gt; 50$ kpc, $\langle B_{\|}\rangle$ is found to be $2.39 \pm 0.7 \ \mu$G and $1.67 \pm 0.38 \ \mu$G, respectively. This suggests a clear indication of varying magnetic field from the disk to the circumgalactic medium. This work provides a methodology that, when applied to ongoing and future radio polarisation surveys such as LOFAR and SKA, promises to significantly enhance our understanding of magnetic field mapping in galactic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <title>Massive Black Hole Seeds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pathway(s) to seeding the massive black holes (MBHs) that exist at the heart of galaxies in the present and distant Universe remains an unsolved problem. Here we categorise, describe and quantitatively discuss the formation pathways of both $\textit{light}$ and $\textit{heavy}$ seeds. We emphasise that the most recent computational models suggest that rather than a bimodal-like mass spectrum between $\textit{light}$ and $\textit{heavy}$ seeds with $\textit{light}$ at one end and $\textit{heavy}$ at the other that instead a continuum exists. $\textit{Light}$ seeds being more ubiquitous and the heavier seeds becoming less and less abundant due the rarer environmental conditions required for their formation. We therefore examine the different mechanisms that give rise to different seed mass spectrums. We show how and why the mechanisms that produce the $\textit{heaviest}$ seeds are also among the rarest events in the Universe and are hence extremely unlikely to be the seeds for the vast majority of the MBH population. We quantify, within the limits of the current large uncertainties in the seeding processes, the expected number densities of the seed mass spectrum. We argue that $\textit{light}$ seeds must be at least $10^{3}$ to $10^{5}$ times more numerous than $\textit{heavy}$ seeds to explain the MBH population as a whole. Based on our current understanding of the seed population this makes $\textit{heavy}$ seeds ($\rm{M_{seed}} &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) a significantly more likely pathway given that $\textit{heavy}$ seeds have an abundance pattern than is close to and likely in excess of $10^{-4}$ compared to $\textit{light}$ seeds. Finally, we examine the current state-of-the-art in numerical calculations and recent observations and plot a path forward for near-future advances in both domains.</description>

Abstract: The McVittie-Plummer spacetime is a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model that represents a spherical star system embedded in a standard FLRW cosmological model. We study the main physical properties of this gravitational field. Regarding the interplay between the physics of the local system and the expanding background, we employ the Misner-Sharp mass-energy function to show that there is a relatively weak time-dependent general relativistic coupling between the astrophysical system and the background FLRW cosmological model. The coupling term is proportional to the inverse of the scale factor and decreases as the universe expands.</description>

      <title>Q-Balls in the presence of attractive force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons in field theories whose stability is typically guaranteed by the existence of a global conserved charge. A classic realization is the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) Q-ball in a two-scalar system where a real scalar $\chi$ triggers symmetry breaking and confines a complex scalar $\Phi$ with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A quartic interaction $\kappa \chi^2|\Phi|^2$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ is usually considered to produce a nontrivial Q-ball configuration, and this repulsive force contributes to its stability. On the other hand, the attractive cubic interaction $\Lambda \chi |\Phi|^2$ is generally allowed in a renormalizable theory and could induce an instability. In this paper, we study the behavior of the Q-ball under the influence of this attractive force which has been overlooked. We find approximate Q-ball solutions in the limit of weak and moderate force couplings using the thin-wall and thick-wall approximations respectively. Our analytical results are consistent with numerical simulations and predict the parameter dependencies of the maximum charge. A crucial difference with the ordinary FLS Q-ball is the existence of the maximum charge beyond which the Q-ball solution is classically unstable. Such a limitation of the charge fundamentally affects Q-ball formation in the early Universe and could plausibly lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>
