      <title>Constructing Markov chains with given dependence and marginal stationary distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method of constructing Markov chains on finite state spaces is provided. The chain is specified by three constraints: stationarity, dependence and marginal distributions. The generalized Pythagorean theorem in information geometry plays a central role in the construction. An algorithm for obtaining the desired Markov chain is described. Integer-valued autoregressive processes are considered for illustration.</description>

      <title>Bad local minima exist in the stochastic block model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the disassortative stochastic block model with three communities, a well-studied model of graph partitioning and Bayesian inference for which detailed predictions based on the cavity method exist [Decelle et al. (2011)]. We provide strong evidence that for a part of the phase where efficient algorithms exist that approximately reconstruct the communities, inference based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) fails. In other words, we show that there exist modes of the posterior distribution that have a vanishing agreement with the ground truth. The proof is based on the analysis of a graph colouring algorithm from [Achlioptas and Moore (2003)].</description>

      <title>Preventive Replacement Policies of Parallel/Series Systems with Dependent Components under Deviation Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript studies the preventive replacement policy for a series or parallel system consisting of n independent or dependent heterogeneous components. Firstly, for the age replacement policy, Some sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the optimal replacement time for both the series and parallel systems are provided. By introducing deviation costs, the expected cost rate of the system is optimized, and the optimal replacement time of the system is extended. Secondly, the periodic replacement policy for series and parallel systems is considered in the dependent case, and a sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the optimal number of periods is provided. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate and discuss the above preventive replacement policies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced power enhancements for testing many moment equalities: Beyond the $2$- and $\infty$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tests based on the $2$- and $\infty$-norm have received considerable attention in high-dimensional testing problems, as they are powerful against dense and sparse alternatives, respectively. The power enhancement principle of Fan et al. (2015) combines these two norms to construct tests that are powerful against both types of alternatives. Nevertheless, the $2$- and $\infty$-norm are just two out of the whole spectrum of $p$-norms that one can base a test on. In the context of testing whether a candidate parameter satisfies a large number of moment equalities, we construct a test that harnesses the strength of all $p$-norms with $p\in[2, \infty]$. As a result, this test consistent against strictly more alternatives than any test based on a single $p$-norm. In particular, our test is consistent against more alternatives than tests based on the $2$- and $\infty$-norm, which is what most implementations of the power enhancement principle target.
  We illustrate the scope of our general results by using them to construct a test that simultaneously dominates the Anderson-Rubin test (based on $p=2$) and tests based on the $\infty$-norm in terms of consistency in the linear instrumental variable model with many (weak) instruments.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence of the Expectation Maximization algorithm under a logarithmic Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By utilizing recently developed tools for constructing gradient flows on Wasserstein spaces, we extend an analysis technique commonly employed to understand alternating minimization algorithms on Euclidean space to the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm via its representation as coordinate-wise minimization on the product of a Euclidean space and a space of probability distributions due to Neal and Hinton (1998). In so doing we obtain finite sample error bounds and exponential convergence of the EM algorithm under a natural generalisation of a log-Sobolev inequality. We further demonstrate that the analysis technique is sufficiently flexible to allow also the analysis of several variants of the EM algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We stratify families of projective and very affine hypersurfaces according to their topological Euler characteristic. Our new algorithms compute all strata using algebro-geometric techniques. For very affine hypersurfaces, we investigate and exploit the relation to critical point computations. Euler stratifications are relevant in particle physics and algebraic statistics. They fully describe the dependence of the number of master integrals, respectively the maximum likelihood degree, on kinematic or model parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal parameter estimation for linear SPDEs from multiple measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coefficients in a second order parabolic linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) are estimated from multiple spatially localised measurements. Assuming that the spatial resolution tends to zero and the number of measurements is non-decreasing, the rate of convergence for each coefficient depends on its differential order and is faster for higher order coefficients. Based on an explicit analysis of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of a general stochastic evolution equation, a Gaussian lower bound scheme is introduced. As a result, minimax optimality of the rates as well as sufficient and necessary conditions for consistent estimation are established.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach with Gaussian priors to the inverse problem of source identification in elliptic PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the statistical linear inverse problem of making inference on an unknown source function in an elliptic partial differential equation from noisy observations of its solution. We employ nonparametric Bayesian procedures based on Gaussian priors, leading to convenient conjugate formulae for posterior inference. We review recent results providing theoretical guarantees on the quality of the resulting posterior-based estimation and uncertainty quantification, and we discuss the application of the theory to the important classes of Gaussian series priors defined on the Dirichlet-Laplacian eigenbasis and Mat\'ern process priors. We provide an implementation of posterior inference for both classes of priors, and investigate its performance in a numerical simulation study.</description>

      <title>A Unification of Exchangeability and Continuous Exposure and Confounder Measurement Errors: Probabilistic Exchangeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07910v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchangeability concerning a continuous exposure, X, may be assumed to identify average exposure effects of X, AEE(X). When X is measured with error (Xep), three challenges arise. First, exchangeability regarding Xep does not equal exchangeability regarding X. Second, the non-differential error assumption (NDEA) could be overly stringent in practice. Third, a definition of exchangeability that implies that AEE(Xep) can differ from AEE(X) is lacking. To address them, this article proposes unifying exchangeability and exposure/confounder measurement errors with three novel concepts. The first, Probabilistic Exchangeability (PE) is an exchangeability assumption that allows for the difference between AEE(Xep) and AEE(X). The second concept, Emergent Pseudo Confounding (EPC), describes the bias introduced by exposure measurement error through mechanisms like confounding mechanisms. The third, Emergent Confounding, describes when bias due to confounder measurement error arises. PE requires adjustment for E(P)C, which can be performed like confounding adjustment. Under PE, the coefficient of determination (R2) in the regression of Xep against X may sometimes be sufficient to measure the difference between AEE(Xep) and AEE(X) in risk difference and ratio scales. This paper provides comprehensive insight into when AEE(Xep) is a surrogate of AEE(X). Differential errors could be addressed and may not compromise causal inference</description>

      <title>Performing global sensitivity analysis on simulations of a continuous-time Markov chain model motivated by epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07277v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we apply a methodology introduced in Navarro Jimenez et al (2016) in the framework of chemical reaction networks to perform a global sensitivity analysis on simulations of a continuous-time Markov chain model motivated by epidemiology. Our goal is to quantify not only the effects of uncertain parameters such as epidemic parameters (transmission rate,  mean sojourn duration in compartments), but also  those of intrinsic randomness and interactions between epidemic parameters and intrinsic randomness. For that purpose, following what was proposed in Navarro Jimenez et al, we leverage three exact simulation algorithms for continuous-time Markov chains from the state of the art which we combine with common tools from variance-based sensitivity analysis as introduced in Sobol (1993). Also, we discuss the impact of the choice of the simulation algorithm used for the simulations on the results of sensitivity analysis. Such a discussion is new, at least to our knowledge. In a numerical section, we implement and compare three sensitivity analyses based on simulations obtained from different exact simulation algorithms of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric extensions of randomized response for private confidence sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work derives methods for performing nonparametric, nonasymptotic statistical inference for population means under the constraint of local differential privacy (LDP). Given bounded observations $(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ with mean $\mu^\star$ that are privatized into $(Z_1, \dots, Z_n)$, we present confidence intervals (CI) and time-uniform confidence sequences (CS) for $\mu^\star$ when only given access to the privatized data. To achieve this, we study a nonparametric and sequentially interactive generalization of Warner's famous ``randomized response'' mechanism, satisfying LDP for arbitrary bounded random variables, and then provide CIs and CSs for their means given access to the resulting privatized observations. For example, our results yield private analogues of Hoeffding's inequality in both fixed-time and time-uniform regimes. We extend these Hoeffding-type CSs to capture time-varying (non-stationary) means, and conclude by illustrating how these methods can be used to conduct private online A/B tests.</description>

      <title>Detection of Correlated Random Vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of deciding whether two standard normal random vectors $\mathsf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\mathsf{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are correlated or not. This is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem, where under the null hypothesis, these vectors are statistically independent, while under the alternative, $\mathsf{X}$ and a randomly and uniformly permuted version of $\mathsf{Y}$, are correlated with correlation $\rho$. We analyze the thresholds at which optimal testing is information-theoretically impossible and possible, as a function of $n$ and $\rho$. To derive our information-theoretic lower bounds, we develop a novel technique for evaluating the second moment of the likelihood ratio using an orthogonal polynomials expansion, which among other things, reveals a surprising connection to integer partition functions. We also study a multi-dimensional generalization of the above setting, where rather than two vectors we observe two databases/matrices, and furthermore allow for partial correlations between these two.</description>

      <title>Invariant kernels on the space of complex covariance matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work develops certain analytical tools required to construct and compute invariant kernels on the space of complex covariance matrices. The main result is the $\mathrm{L}^1\,-$Godement theorem, which states that any invariant kernel, which is (in a certain natural sense) also integrable, can be computed by taking the inverse spherical transform of a positive function. General expressions for inverse spherical transforms are then provided, which can be used to explore new families of invariant kernels, at a rather moderate computational cost. A further, alternative approach for constructing new invariant kernels is also introduced, based on Ramanujan's master theorem for symmetric cones.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Kernel Stein Discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel methods underpin many of the most successful approaches in data science and statistics, and they allow representing probability measures as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space without loss of information. Recently, the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which combines Stein's method with kernel techniques, gained considerable attention. Through the Stein operator, KSD allows the construction of powerful goodness-of-fit tests where it is sufficient to know the target distribution up to a multiplicative constant. However, the typical U- and V-statistic-based KSD estimators suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity, which hinders their application in large-scale settings. In this work, we propose a Nystr\"om-based KSD acceleration -- with runtime $\mathcal O\!\left(mn+m^3\right)$ for $n$ samples and $m\ll n$ Nystr\"om points -- , show its $\sqrt{n}$-consistency under the null with a classical sub-Gaussian assumption, and demonstrate its applicability for goodness-of-fit testing on a suite of benchmarks.</description>
