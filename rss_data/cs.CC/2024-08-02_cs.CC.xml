      <title>A Survey on the Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) represent a revolutionary advance in computational integrity and privacy technology, enabling the secure and private exchange of information without revealing underlying private data. ZKPs have unique advantages in terms of universality and minimal security assumptions when compared to other privacy-sensitive computational methods for distributed systems, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. Their application spans multiple domains, from enhancing privacy in blockchain to facilitating confidential verification of computational tasks. This survey starts with a high-level overview of the technical workings of ZKPs with a focus on an increasingly relevant subset of ZKPs called zk-SNARKS. While there have been prior surveys on the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of ZKPs, our work is distinguished by providing a broader view of practical aspects and describing many recently-developed use cases of ZKPs across various domains. These application domains span blockchain privacy, scaling, storage, and interoperability, as well as non-blockchain applications like voting, authentication, timelocks, and machine learning. Aimed at both practitioners and researchers, the survey also covers foundational components and infrastructure such as zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVM), domain-specific languages (DSLs), supporting libraries, frameworks, and protocols. We conclude with a discussion on future directions, positioning ZKPs as pivotal in the advancement of cryptographic practices and digital privacy across many applications.</description>

      <title>On Approximability of Satisfiable k-CSPs: IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a stability result for general $3$-wise correlations over distributions satisfying mild connectivity properties. More concretely, we show that if $\Sigma,\Gamma$ and $\Phi$ are alphabets of constant size, and $\mu$ is a pairwise connected distribution over $\Sigma\times\Gamma\times\Phi$ with no $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ embeddings in which the probability of each atom is $\Omega(1)$, then the following holds. Any triplets of $1$-bounded functions $f\colon \Sigma^n\to\mathbb{C}$, $g\colon \Gamma^n\to\mathbb{C}$, $h\colon \Phi^n\to\mathbb{C}$ satisfying
  \[
  \left|\mathbb{E}_{(x,y,z)\sim \mu^{\otimes n}}\big[f(x)g(y)h(z)\big]\right|\geq \varepsilon
  \]
  must arise from an Abelian group associated with the distribution $\mu$. More specifically, we show that there is an Abelian group $(H,+)$ of constant size such that for any such $f,g$ and $h$, the function $f$ (and similarly $g$ and $h$) is correlated with a function of the form $\tilde{f}(x) = \chi(\sigma(x_1),\ldots,\sigma(x_n)) L (x)$, where $\sigma\colon \Sigma \to H$ is some map, $\chi\in \hat{H}^{\otimes n}$ is a character, and $L\colon \Sigma^n\to\mathbb{C}$ is a low-degree function with bounded $2$-norm.
  En route we prove a few additional results that may be of independent interest, such as an improved direct product theorem, as well as a result we refer to as a ``restriction inverse theorem'' about the structure of functions that, under random restrictions, with noticeable probability have significant correlation with a product function. In companion papers, we show applications of our results to the fields of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs, as well as various areas in discrete mathematics such as extremal combinatorics and additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Improved Space Bounds for Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than 40 years ago, Schroeppel and Shamir presented an algorithm that solves the Subset Sum problem for $n$ integers in time $O^*(2^{0.5n})$ and space $O^*(2^{0.25n})$. The time upper bound remains unbeaten, but the space upper bound has been improved to $O^*(2^{0.249999n})$ in a recent breakthrough paper by Nederlof and W\k{e}grzycki (STOC 2021). Their algorithm is a clever combination of a number of previously known techniques with a new reduction and a new algorithm for the Orthogonal Vectors problem. In this paper, we improve the space bound by Nederlof and W\k{e}grzycki to $O^*(2^{0.246n})$ and also simplify their algorithm and its analysis. We achieve this by using an idea, due to Howgrave-Graham and Joux, of using a random prime number to filter the family of subsets. We incorporate it into the algorithm by Schroeppel and Shamir and then use this amalgam inside the representation technique. This allows us to reduce an instance of Subset Sum to a larger number of instances of weighted orthogonal vector.</description>
