      <title>Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood Rewards for Multiagent Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient exploration is critical for multiagent systems to discover coordinated strategies, particularly in open-ended domains such as search and rescue or planetary surveying. However, when exploration is encouraged only at the individual agent level, it often leads to redundancy, as agents act without awareness of how their teammates are exploring. In this work, we introduce Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards, which score each agent's exploration by isolating its unique contribution to team exploration. Unlike prior methods that reward agents solely for the novelty of their individual observations, CCL emphasizes observations that are informative with respect to the joint exploration of the team. Experiments in continuous multiagent domains show that CCL rewards accelerate learning for domains with sparse team rewards, where most joint actions yield zero rewards, and are particularly effective in tasks that require tight coordination among agents.</description>

      <title>Cooperation Breakdown in LLM Agents Under Communication Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS), in which autonomous AI agents cooperate to solve tasks, are gaining increasing attention. For such systems to be deployed in society, agents must be able to establish cooperation and coordination under real-world computational and communication constraints. We propose the FLCOA framework (Five Layers for Cooperation/Coordination among Autonomous Agents) to conceptualize how cooperation and coordination emerge in groups of autonomous agents, and highlight that the influence of lower-layer factors - especially computational and communication resources - has been largely overlooked. To examine the effect of communication delay, we introduce a Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma with Communication Delay and conduct simulations with LLM-based agents. As delay increases, agents begin to exploit slower responses even without explicit instructions. Interestingly, excessive delay reduces cycles of exploitation, yielding a U-shaped relationship between delay magnitude and mutual cooperation. These results suggest that fostering cooperation requires attention not only to high-level institutional design but also to lower-layer factors such as communication delay and resource allocation, pointing to new directions for MAS research.</description>

      <title>Multi-Defender Single-Attacker Perimeter Defense Game on a Cylinder: Special Case in which the Attacker Starts at the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a multi-agent perimeter defense game played on a cylinder. A team of n slow-moving defenders must prevent a single fast-moving attacker from crossing the boundary of a defensive perimeter. We describe the conditions necessary for the attacker to win in the special case that the intruder starts close to the boundary and in a region that is currently defended.</description>

      <title>DEpiABS: Differentiable Epidemic Agent-Based Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the limitations of existing epidemic simulation tools. These tools provide information that guides non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), yet many struggle to capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally practical and interpretable. We introduce DEpiABS, a scalable, differentiable agent-based model (DABM) that balances mechanistic detail, computational efficiency and interpretability. DEpiABS captures individual-level heterogeneity in health status, behaviour, and resource constraints, while also modelling epidemic processes like viral mutation and reinfection dynamics. The model is fully differentiable, enabling fast simulation and gradient-based parameter calibration. Building on this foundation, we introduce a z-score-based scaling method that maps small-scale simulations to any real-world population sizes with negligible loss in output granularity, reducing the computational burden when modelling large populations. We validate DEpiABS through sensitivity analysis and calibration to COVID-19 and flu data from ten regions of varying scales. Compared to the baseline, DEpiABS is more detailed, fully interpretable, and has reduced the average normal deviation in forecasting from 0.97 to 0.92 on COVID-19 mortality data and from 0.41 to 0.32 on influenza-like-illness data. Critically, these improvements are achieved without relying on auxiliary data, making DEpiABS a reliable, generalisable, and data-efficient framework for future epidemic response modelling.</description>

      <title>Federated Gaussian Process Learning via Pseudo-Representations for Large-Scale Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot systems require scalable and federated methods to model complex environments under computational and communication constraints. Gaussian Processes (GPs) offer robust probabilistic modeling, but suffer from cubic computational complexity, limiting their applicability in large-scale deployments. To address this challenge, we introduce the pxpGP, a novel distributed GP framework tailored for both centralized and decentralized large-scale multi-robot networks. Our approach leverages sparse variational inference to generate a local compact pseudo-representation. We introduce a sparse variational optimization scheme that bounds local pseudo-datasets and formulate a global scaled proximal-inexact consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with adaptive parameter updates and warm-start initialization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that pxpGP and its decentralized variant, dec-pxpGP, outperform existing distributed GP methods in hyperparameter estimation and prediction accuracy, particularly in large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Network Outbreaks under Group Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key public health problem during an outbreak is to reconstruct the disease cascade from a partial set of confirmed infections. This has been studied extensively under the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) formulation, which reduces the problem to finding some type of Steiner subgraph on a network. Group surveillance like wastewater or aerosol monitoring is a form of mass/pooled testing where samples from multiple individuals are pooled together and tested once for all. While a single negative test clears multiple individuals, a positive test does not reveal the infected individuals in the test pool. We introduce the POOLCASCADEMLE problem in the setting of a network propagation process, where the goal is to find a MLE cascade subgraph which is consistent with the pooled test outcomes. Previous work on reconstruction assumes that the test results are of individuals, i.e., pools of size one, and requires a consistent cascade to connect the positive testing nodes. In POOLCASCADEMLE, a consistent cascade must choose at least one node in each positive pool, adding another combinatorial layer. We show that, under the Independent Cascade (IC) model, POOLCASCADEMLE is NP-hard, and present an approximation algorithm based on a reduction to the Group Steiner Tree problem. We also consider a one-hop version of this problem, in which the disease can spread for one time step after being seeded. We show that even this restricted version is NP-hard, and develop a method using linear programming relaxation and rounding. We evaluate the performance of our methods on real and synthetic contact networks, in terms of missing infection recovery and prevalence estimation. We find that our approach outperforms meaningful baselines which correspond to pools of size one and use state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Robust Value Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance. Code and data are available at https://github.com/crqu/robust-coMARL.</description>

      <title>Non-Trivial Consensus on Directed Matrix-Weighted Networks with Cooperative and Antagonistic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the non-trivial consensus problem on directed signed matrix-weighted networks\textemdash a novel convergence state that has remained largely unexplored despite prior studies on bipartite consensus and trivial consensus. Notably, we first prove that for directed signed matrix-weighted networks, every eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacians has positive real part under certain conditions. This key finding ensures the global asymptotic convergence of systems states to the null spaces of signed matrix-weighted Laplacians, providing a foundational tool for analyzing dynamics on rooted signed matrix-weighted networks. To achieve non-trivial consensus, we propose a systematic approach involving the strategic selection of informed agents, careful design of external signals, and precise determination of coupling terms. Crucially, we derive the lower bounds of the coupling coefficients. Our consensus algorithm operates under milder connectivity conditions, and does not impose restrictions on whether the network is structurally balanced or unbalanced. Moreover, the non-trivial consensus state can be preset arbitrarily as needed. We also carry out the above analysis for undirected networks, with more relaxed conditions on the coupling coefficients comparing to the directed case. This paper further studies non-trivial consensus with switching topologies, and propose the necessary condition for the convergence of switching networks. The work in this paper demonstrates that groups with both cooperative and antagonistic multi-dimensional interactions can achieve consensus, which was previously deemed exclusive to fully cooperative groups.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence to Nash Equilibrium in Nonconvex General-Sum Games under the $n$-Sided PL Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium (NE) in a general-sum game, where player $i$'s objective is $f_i(x)=f_i(x_1,...,x_n)$, with $x_j\in\mathbb{R}^{d_j}$ denoting the strategy variables of player $j$. Our focus is on investigating first-order gradient-based algorithms and their variations, such as the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, for tackling this problem. We introduce a set of conditions, called the $n$-sided PL condition, which extends the well-established gradient dominance condition a.k.a Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the concept of multi-convexity. This condition, satisfied by various classes of non-convex functions, allows us to analyze the convergence of various gradient descent (GD) algorithms. Moreover, our study delves into scenarios where the standard gradient descent methods fail to converge to NE. In such cases, we propose adapted variants of GD that converge towards NE and analyze their convergence rates. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through several experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi UAVs Preflight Planning in a Shared and Dynamic Airspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.</description>

      <title>Convex Markov Games and Beyond: New Proof of Existence, Characterization and Learning Algorithms for Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex Markov Games (cMGs) were recently introduced as a broad class of multi-agent learning problems that generalize Markov games to settings where strategic agents optimize general utilities beyond additive rewards. While cMGs expand the modeling frontier, their theoretical foundations, particularly the structure of Nash equilibria (NE) and guarantees for learning algorithms, are not yet well understood. In this work, we address these gaps for an extension of cMGs, which we term General Utility Markov Games (GUMGs), capturing new applications requiring coupling between agents' occupancy measures. We prove that in GUMGs, Nash equilibria coincide with the fixed points of projected pseudo-gradient dynamics (i.e., first-order stationary points), enabled by a novel agent-wise gradient domination property. This insight also yields a simple proof of NE existence using Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. We further show the existence of Markov perfect equilibria. Building on this characterization, we establish a policy gradient theorem for GUMGs and design a model-free policy gradient algorithm. For potential GUMGs, we establish iteration complexity guarantees for computing approximate-NE under exact gradients and provide sample complexity bounds in both the generative model and on-policy settings. Our results extend beyond prior work restricted to zero-sum cMGs, providing the first theoretical analysis of common-interest cMGs.</description>

      <title>Normative Feeling: Socially Patterned Affective Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breaking a norm elicits both material and emotional consequences, yet how this coupling arose evolutionarily remains unclear. We investigate this question in light of emerging work suggesting that normativity's building blocks emerged earlier in evolution than previously considered, arguing that normative processes should inform accounts of how even ancient capacities such as mood evolved. Using a definition of normative processes we developed, we created an agent-based model with evolvable affect in a shared resource dilemma, comparing competition (non-normative) versus punishment (normative) conditions. Critically, different mood mechanisms emerge under each condition. Under competition, agents evolve a "bad mood -&gt; consume more" response, creating a tragedy of the commons leading to resource depletion and population collapse. Under punishment, agents evolve a "bad mood -&gt; consume less" mechanism, where negative affect functions as an implicit signal of social sanction, promoting resource conservation. Importantly, once normative logic is imprinted through punishment, it creates an evolutionary pathway for mood-based signalling that operates without costly physical enforcement. Our findings demonstrate how normative processes enable social preferences to emerge in a distributed manner within psychological mechanisms, showing how normative processes reprogram cognitive and physiological systems by embedding cultural patterns into psychological dispositions.</description>

      <title>Parallelism Meets Adaptiveness: Scalable Documents Understanding in Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17061v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown increasing promise for collaborative task completion. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.</description>

      <title>CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</description>

      <title>Exploring Silicon-Based Societies: An Early Study of the Moltbook Agent Community</title>

Abstract: The rapid emergence of autonomous large language model agents has given rise to persistent, large-scale agent ecosystems whose collective behavior cannot be adequately understood through anecdotal observation or small-scale simulation. This paper introduces data-driven silicon sociology as a systematic empirical framework for studying social structure formation among interacting artificial agents. We present a pioneering large-scale data mining investigation of an in-the-wild agent society by analyzing Moltbook, a social platform designed primarily for agent-to-agent interaction. At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces. This work establishes a methodological foundation for data-driven silicon sociology and demonstrates that data mining techniques can provide a powerful lens for understanding the organization and evolution of large autonomous agent societies.</description>

      <title>Large-scale distributed synchronization systems, using a cancel-on-completion redundancy mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent distributed synchronization systems, which are modeled as $n$ particles moving on the real line. This class generalizes the model of a multi-server queueing system, considered in [15], employing so-called cancel-on-completion (c.o.c.) redundancy mechanism, but is motivated by other applications as well. The model in [15] is a particle system, regulated at the left boundary point. The more general model of this paper is such that we allow regulation boundaries on either side, or both sides, or no regulation at all. We consider the mean-field asymptotic regime, when the number of particles $n$ and the job arrival rates go to infinity, while the job arrival rates per particle remain constant. The system state for a given $n$ is the empirical distribution of the particles' locations. The results include: the existence/uniqueness of fixed points of mean-field limits (ML), which describe the limiting dynamics of the system; conditions for the steady-state asymptotic independence (concentration of the stationary distribution on a single ML fixed point); the limits of the average velocity at which unregulated (free) particle system advances. In particular, our results for the left-regulated system unify and generalize the corresponding results in [15]. Our technical approach is such that the systems with different types of regulation are analyzed within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>KVComm: Enabling Efficient LLM Communication through Selective KV Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Modal Logical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), a neurosymbolic framework that integrates deep learning with the formal semantics of modal logic, enabling reasoning about necessity and possibility. Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\Box$ and $\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure.
  This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, multi-agent epistemic trust, detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation, and combinatorial constraint satisfaction in Sudoku. These experiments demonstrate how enforcing or learning accessibility can increase logical consistency and interpretability without changing the underlying task architecture.</description>
