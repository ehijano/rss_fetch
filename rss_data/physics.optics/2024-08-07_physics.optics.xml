      <title>Propagation of pulsed light in an optical cavity in a gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All modern theories of gravitation, starting with Newton's, predict that gravity will affect the speed of light propagation. Einstein's theory of General Relativity famously predicted that the effect is twice the Newtonian value, a prediction that was verified during the 1919 solar eclipse. Recent theories of vector gravity can be interpreted to imply that gravity will have a different effect on pulsed light versus continuous-wave (CW) light propagating between the two mirrors of an optical cavity. Interestingly, we are not aware of any previous experiments to determine the relative effect of gravity on the propagation of pulsed versus CW light. In order to observe if there are small differences, we use a 6 GHz electro-optic frequency comb and low-noise CW laser to make careful measurements of the resonance frequencies of a high-finesse optical cavity. Once correcting for the effects of mirror dispersion, we determine that the cavity resonance frequencies for pulsed and CW light are the same to within our experimental error, which is on the order of $10^{-12}$ of the optical frequency, and one part in 700 of the expected gravitational shift.</description>

      <title>Collinear Optical Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy with Fluorescence Detection at 5 kHz Repetition Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) is a powerful ultrafast spectroscopic technique that can greatly benefit from the unique features of a femtosecond laser operating at a kHz repetition rate. However, isolating specific nonlinear signal in the collinear geometry, especially with a kHz laser, presents challenges. We present an experimental implementation of optical 2DCS in a collinear geometry using a femtosecond laser operating at a 5 KHz repetition rate. The desired nonlinear signal is selectively extracted in the frequency domain by lock-in detection. Both pump-probe and optical 2DCS experiments were conducted on a rubidium vapor. The signal-to-noise ratio of pump-probe and 2DCS spectra was characterised under various experimental parameters. The study highlights the importance of the lock-in reference frequency in overcoming the limitations imposed by low repetition rates, thereby paving the way for the application of collinear optical 2DCS in material systems requiring kHz femtosecond lasers.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Lasing Behavior in a Nonlinear Plasmonic Random Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unprecedented double-threshold lasing behavior has been observed in a plasmonic random laser composed of Au nanoislands decorated on vertically standing ZnO nanorods, infiltrated with dye-doped polymer matrix. The strong coupling of random laser modes to plasmonic nanocavities results in a dominant absorption of the random laser emission, leading to the first unusual lasing threshold. At higher pump fluences, the nonlinear optical behavior of the Au nanoislands induces a second lasing threshold. Various statistical tools have been employed to analyze the intensity fluctuations of the random laser modes, validating this unique lasing behavior.</description>

      <title>Designing and analyzing microwave photonic spectral domain filters based on transversal filtering with optical microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave transversal filters, which are implemented based on the transversal filter structure in digital signal processing, offer a high reconfigurability for achieving a variety of signal processing functions without changing hardware. When implemented using microwave photonic (MWP) technologies, also known as MWP transversal filters, they provide competitive advantages over their electrical counterparts, such as low loss, large operation bandwidth, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. Recent advances in high performance optical microcombs provide compact and powerful multiwavelength sources for MWP transversal filters that require a larger number of wavelength channels to achieve high performance, allowing for the demonstration of a diverse range of filter functions with improved performance and new features. Here, we present a comprehensive performance analysis for microcomb based MWP spectral filters based on the transversal filter approach. First, we investigate the theoretical limitations in the filter spectral response induced by finite tap numbers. Next, we analyze the distortions in the filter spectral response resulting from experimental error sources. Finally, we assess the influence of input signals bandwidth on the filtering errors. These results provide a valuable guide for the design and optimization of microcomb-based MWP transversal filters for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate ring Mach Zehnder coupling interferometer as an efficient quantum source of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photons and squeezed light are the two primary workhorses for quantum computation and quantum communication. Generating high-efficiency single photons with high purity and heralding efficiency is the prerequisite for photonic quantum computers. At the same time, generating high-efficiency scalable squeezed light is the prerequisite for continuous variable quantum computing along with sensing applications. Here, we propose a symmetric ring-Mach-Zehnder interferometer (RMZI), which includes a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide as an efficient source of squeezed light and a single-photon source. We numerically show that our proposed design can generate tunable squeezed light with a squeezing level higher than -12dB with sub-milli-watt (mW) pump power. The proposed device can also generate single photons with purity as high as 99(95)% with heralding efficiency 94(99)% using only 20ps long pulses. Our proposed design is fully compatible with current fabrication technology.</description>

      <title>Exceptional features in nonlinear Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems and their topological singularities, such as exceptional points (EPs), lines, and surfaces, have recently attracted intense interest. The investigation of these exceptional constituents has led to fruitful applications. The responsivity of the eigenvalue diverges at EPs, and chiral state transfer occurs when encircling an EP. Traditionally, it was believed that these exceptional features were unique to non-Hermitian systems requiring gain, loss, or nonreciprocal hopping. Here, we show that these exceptional features are also present in nonlinear Hermitian systems. We consider two coupled resonators with Kerr nonlinearity in one resonator, and no non-Hermitian terms. We identify EP-like points (ELPs) on the eigenspectra where the critical behaviors are the same as those of typical EPs. Additionally, this nonlinear Hermitian system can be mapped to linear non-Hermitian systems, with ELPs corresponding to EPs. We also demonstrate that encirclement around an ELP in the parameter space leads to unique chiral state transfer behavior.</description>

      <title>Robust characterization of photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer ultra-broad optical bandwidths that enable unprecedented data throughputs for signal processing applications. Dynamic reconfigurability enables compensation of fabrication flaws and fluctuating external environments, tuning for adaptive equalization and training of optical neural networks. The initial step in PIC reconfiguration entails measuring its dynamic performance, often described by its frequency response. While measuring the amplitude response is straightforward, e.g. using a tunable laser and optical power meter, measuring the phase response presents challenges due to various factors, including phase variations in test connections and instrumentation limitations. To address these challenges, a universal and robust characterization technique is proposed, which uses an on-chip reference path coupled to the signal processing core (SPC), with a delay larger or smaller than the total delay across the signal processing paths. A Fourier transform of the chip's power response reveals the SPC's impulse response. The method is more robust against low reference-path power and imprecise delays. Experiments using a finite-impulse-response (FIR) structure demonstrate rapid SPC training, overcoming thermal crosstalk and device imperfections. This approach offers a promising solution for PIC characterization, facilitating expedited physical parameter training for advanced applications in communications and optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Capturing Nonlinear Electron Dynamics with Fully Characterised Attosecond X-ray Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are the key to studying electron dynamics at their natural time scale involving specific electronic states. They are promising to build the conceptual bridge between physical and chemical photo-reaction processes. Free-electron lasers have demonstrated their capability of generating intense attosecond X-ray pulses. However, harnessing them for time-resolving experiments and investigations of nonlinear X-ray absorption mechanisms remains a cutting-edge challenge. We have characterised X-ray pulses with durations of down to 700$\,$attoseconds and peak powers up to 200$\,$GW at $\sim$ 1$\,$keV photon energy via angular streaking at the SQS instrument of the European XFEL. As direct application, we present results of nonlinear X-ray-matter interaction via state-specific spectroscopy on a transient system. Using the derived spectral and temporal information of each pulse, we deliberately steer the probability for formation of double-core vacancies in neon gas atoms through excitation or ionisation of the second inner-shell electron after K-shell ionisation. Our results advance the field of attosecond science with highly intense and fully characterised X-ray pulses to the site-specific investigation of electronic motion in transient media.</description>

      <title>A Modal Analysis of Electromagnetic Fields Coupling into an Open-Ended Waveguide Mounted on a Finite Flange: Evaluation of a Rectangular Waveguide with a Square Flange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a modal analysis based on the reciprocity theorem to calculate the coupled/penetrated fields into an open-ended waveguide mounted on a finite flange. Although there is no limitation on the geometry and type of the external source, an infinitesimal dipole is chosen to produce a plane wave incident to the waveguide aperture. The proposed method relates the amplitude of each penetrated mode into the waveguide to the far-field radiation components of that mode from the waveguide aperture. The accuracy of the final result depends on the accuracy of the calculated radiated fields. The radiated field components are calculated considering the reflected fields due to the aperture and the diffracted fields due to the flange edges. For the first time, the impact of a finite flange on the penetrated fields into a waveguide is discussed comprehensively. The geometry of a rectangular waveguide mounted on a thick square flange is selected to be evaluated. The effects of changing the main parameters of the geometry on the penetrated fields are discussed rigorously in various examples. Our results are compared with 3D full-wave simulations, and an excellent agreement was found between the results while our analytical approach showing a 60 times faster performance. In addition, we compared our results with the measurement reported in a previous study.</description>

      <title>Effects of retardation on many-body superradiance in chiral waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the superradiant decay of a chain of atoms coupled to a chiral waveguide, focusing on the regime of non-negligible photon propagation time. Using an exact master equation description which accounts for delay effects, we obtain evidence to suggest that competition between collective decay and retardation leads to the emergence of an effective maximum number of atoms able to contribute to the superradiant dynamics, resulting in a plateau of the peak emission rate. To develop this analysis further, we investigate the inter-atomic correlations to find features consistent with the formation of individual superradiant domains. Moreover, we find that retardation can also result in persistent oscillatory atomic dynamics accompanied by a periodic sequence of emission bursts.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation due to spatial structure of radiation beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that spatially structured radiation generates second harmonic in a two-dimensional system even if the system is homogeneous and isotropic. The effect originates from non-locality of electric response to structured electromagnetic field. We develop an analytical theory of such a second harmonic generation in conducting two-dimensional systems. For the general type of structured radiation, we calculate the emerging electric currents at the double frequency and the emitted second harmonic radiation. The theory applied to twisted light reveals that the angular momentum of light doubles in the second harmonic emission. Our results pave the way for second harmonic generation and structuring in two-dimensional materials beyond the constraints imposed by crystal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We consider reflectionless wave propagation in networks modeled in terms of the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NNLS) equation on metric graphs, for which transparent boundary conditions are imposed at the vertices. By employing the ``potential approach" previously used for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we derive transparent boundary conditions for the NNLS equation on metric graphs. These conditions eliminate backscattering at graph vertices, which is crucial for minimizing losses in signal, heat, and charge transfer in various applications such as optical fibers, optoelectronic networks, and low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Role of time-frequency correlations in two-photon-two-atom resonance energy transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitation energy transfer is a photophysical process upon which many chemical and biological phenomena are built. From natural small systems to synthetic multichromophoric macromolecules, energy transfer deals with the process of migration of electronic excitation energy from an excited donor to an acceptor. Although this phenomenon has been extensively studied in the past, the rapid evolution of quantum-enabled technologies has motivated the question on whether nonclassical sources of light, such as entangled photon pairs, may provide us with a better control (or enhancement) of energy transfer at the nanoscale. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the joint excitation of two non-interacting two-level atoms by time-frequency correlated photon pairs -- whose central frequencies are not resonant with the individual particles -- generated by means of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). We demonstrate that while strong frequency anti-correlation between photons guarantees a large two-photon excitation (TPE) probability, photons bearing a sine cardinal spectral shape exhibit a $\sim$3.8 times larger TPE signal than photons with a Gaussian spectrum. More importantly, we find that suppression of time-ordered excitation pathways does not substantially modify the TPE probability for two-photon states with a Gaussian spectral shape; whereas photons with a sine cardinal spectrum exhibit the strongest TPE signals when two-photon excitation pathways are not suppressed. Our results not only help elucidating the role of time-frequency correlations in resonance energy transfer with SPDC photons, but also provide valuable information regarding the optimal source to be used in its experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Fundamental charge noise in electro-optic photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding thermodynamical measurement noise is of central importance for electrical and optical precision measurements from mass-fabricated semiconductor sensors, where the Brownian motion of charge carriers poses limits, to optical reference cavities for atomic clocks or gravitational wave detection, which are limited by thermorefractive and thermoelastic noise due to the transduction of temperature fluctuations to the refractive index and length fluctuations. Here, we discover that unexpectedly charge carrier density fluctuations give rise to a novel noise process in recently emerged electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that Lithium Niobate and Lithium Tantalate photonic integrated microresonators exhibit an unexpected Flicker type (i.e. $1/f^{1.2}$) scaling in their noise properties, significantly deviating from the well-established thermorefractive noise theory. We show that this noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish electrical Johnson-Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for Pockels integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both classical and quantum devices, ranging from ultra-fast tunable and low-noise lasers, Pockels soliton microcombs, to quantum transduction, squeezed light or entangled photon-pair generation. Equally, this observation offers optical methods to probe mesoscopic charge fluctuations with exceptional precision.</description>

Abstract: The manipulation of solid states using intense infrared or terahertz light fields is a pivotal area in contemporary ultrafast photonics research. While conventional circular polarization has been well explored, the potential of counterrotating bicircular light remains widely underexplored, despite growing interest in theory. In the mid-infrared or multi-terahertz region, experimental challenges lie in difficulties in stabilizing the relative phase between two-color lights and the lack of available polarization elements. Here, we successfully generated phase-stable counterrotating bicircular light pulses in the 10-40 THz frequency range circumventing the above problems. Employing spectral broadening, polarization pulse shaping with a spatial light modulator, and intra-pulse difference frequency generation leveraging a distinctive angular-momentum selection rule within the nonlinear crystal, we achieved direct conversion from near-infrared pulses into the designed counterrotating bicircular multi-terahertz pulses. Use of the spatial light modulator enables programmable control over the shape, orientation, rotational symmetry, and helicity of the bicircular light field trajectory. This advancement provides a novel pathway for the programmable manipulation of light fields, and marks a significant step toward understanding and harnessing the impact of tailored light fields on matter, particularly in the context of topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Microscopy Based on the Inherent Fluctuations of Dye Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a critical tool across various disciplines, from materials science to biomedical research, yet it is limited by the diffraction limit of resolution. Advanced super-resolution techniques such as localization microscopy and stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy often demand considerable resources. These methods depend heavily on elaborate sample-staining, complex optical systems, or prolonged acquisition periods, and their application in 3D and multicolor imaging presents significant experimental challenges. In the current work, we provide a complete demonstration of a widely accessible super-resolution imaging approach capable of 3D and multicolor imaging. We replace the confocal pinhole with an array of single-photon avalanche diodes and use the microsecond-scale fluctuations of dye molecules as a contrast mechanism. This contrast is transformed into a super-resolved image using a robust and deterministic algorithm. Our technique utilizes natural fluctuations inherent to organic dyes, thereby it does not require engineering of the blinking statistics. Our robust, versatile super-resolution method opens the way to next-generation multimodal imaging and facilitates on-demand super-resolution within a confocal architecture.</description>

      <title>Single-cycle, 643-mW average power THz source based on tilted pulse front in lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present, to the best of our knowledge, the highest average power from a laser-driven single-cycle THz source demonstrated so far, using optical rectification in the titled pulse-front geometry in cryogenically cooled lithium niobate, pumped by a commercially available 500 W ultrafast thin-disk Yb-amplifier. We study repetition rate dependent effects in our setup at 100 kHz and 40 kHz at this high average power, revealing different optimal fluence conditions for efficient conversion. The demonstrated sources with multi-100 mW average power at these high repetition rates combine high THz pulse energies and high repetition rate and is thus ideally suited for nonlinear THz spectroscopy experiments with significantly reduced measurement times. The presented result is a first benchmark for high average power THz time domain spectroscopy systems for nonlinear spectroscopy, driven by very high average power ultrafast Yb lasers.</description>

      <title>Integrated Triply Resonant Electro-Optic Frequency Comb in Lithium Tantalate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated frequency comb generators based on Kerr parametric oscillation have led to chip-scale, gigahertz-spaced combs with new applications spanning hyperscale telecommunications, low-noise microwave synthesis, LiDAR, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. Recent progress in lithium niobate (LN) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has resulted in chip-scale electro-optic (EO) frequency combs, offering precise comb-line positioning and simple operation without relying on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. However, current integrated EO combs face limited spectral coverage due to the large microwave power required to drive the non-resonant capacitive electrodes and the strong intrinsic birefringence of Lithium Niobate. Here, we overcome both challenges with an integrated triply resonant architecture, combining monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) with PICs based on the recently emerged thin-film lithium tantalate. With resonantly enhanced EO interaction and reduced birefringence in Lithium Tantalate, we achieve a four-fold comb span extension and a 16-fold power reduction compared to the conventional non-resonant microwave design. Driven by a hybrid-integrated laser diode, the comb spans over 450nm (60THz) with &gt;2000 lines, and the generator fits within a compact 1cm^2 footprint. We additionally observe that the strong EO coupling leads to an increased comb existence range approaching the full free spectral range of the optical microresonator. The ultra-broadband comb generator, combined with detuning-agnostic operation, could advance chip-scale spectrometry and ultra-low-noise millimeter wave synthesis and unlock octave-spanning EO combs. The methodology of co-designing microwave and optical resonators can be extended to a wide range of integrated electro-optics applications.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled non-Hermitian metasurfaces for ultra-sensitive terahertz sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, offer significant advantages in sensor design. However, the extreme sensitivity near EPs poses significant challenges due to fabrication errors and system noises, which degrade sensing performance. To address this, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the polarization degrees of freedom to achieve controllable EPs. By expressing tunable polarization as equivalent gain, we establish a direct relation between the polarization and the phase of the coupled system, and achieve the polarization-controlled singularity even post-fabrication. The polarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect and accurate measurement near the EPs. The theoretical approach is experimentally validated using a general design of THz non-Hermitian metasurface sensors. Our results indicate that this method enhances robustness and sensitivity, opening new avenues for practical applications in ultra-sensitive sensing.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Learning for ab initio Deep Learned Refractive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep optical optimization has recently emerged as a new paradigm for designing computational imaging systems using only the output image as the objective. However, it has been limited to either simple optical systems consisting of a single element such as a diffractive optical element (DOE) or metalens, or the fine-tuning of compound lenses from good initial designs. Here we present a DeepLens design method based on curriculum learning, which is able to learn optical designs of compound lenses ab initio from randomly initialized surfaces without human intervention, therefore overcoming the need for a good initial design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by fully automatically designing both classical imaging lenses and a large field-of-view extended depth-of-field computational lens in a cellphone-style form factor, with highly aspheric surfaces and a short back focal length.</description>
