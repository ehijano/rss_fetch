      <title>Extensions of homogeneous distributions on deformations to the normal cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a deformation to the normal cone $\operatorname{DNC}(M,V)$ we show that given a distribution $u\in\mathcal{D}'(\operatorname{DNC}(M,V)\setminus V\times\mathbb{R})$ if $u$ is homogeneous of order $a$ for the zoom action, then it admits an $a$-homogeneous extension $\widetilde{u}\in\mathcal{D}'(\operatorname{DNC}(M,V))$. We describe all such extensions and discuss briefly about how it translates to the work of Van Erp and Yuncken in arXiv:2303.15787 . The technique used come from the results on the extension of weakly homogeneous distributions provided by Yves Meyer in the 90s.</description>

      <title>Rotationally symmetric Ricci Flow on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a short-time existence theory for complete Ricci flows under scaling-invariant curvature bounds, starting from rotationally symmetric metrics on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are noncollapsed at infinity, without assuming bounded curvature. As a consequence, we construct a complete Ricci flow solution coming out of a rotationally symmetric metric, which has a cone-like singularity at the origin and no minimal hypersphere centered at the origin, using an approximation method.</description>

      <title>The spectral torsion for the one form rescaled Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral torsion is defined by three vector fields and Dirac operators and the noncommutative residue.
  Motivated by the spectral torsion and the one form rescaled Dirac operator, we give some new spectral torsion which is the extension of spectral torsion for Dirac operators, and compute the spectral torsion for the one form rescaled Dirac operator on even-dimensional spin manifolds without boundary.</description>

      <title>Twisted and coupled constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler metrics on minimal ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of twisted constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler (cscK) metrics and non-existence of coupled cscK metrics on minimal ruled surfaces over a Riemann surface of genus $2$. Moreover, we give a bound for the Chen-Cheng invariant related to Chen's continuity path for cscK problem on these ruled surfaces.</description>

      <title>Comparison of total $\sigma_k$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volume comparison theorem is a type of fundamental results in Riemannian geometry. In this article, we extend the volume comparison result in \cite{Besse2008} to the comparison of total $\sigma_l$-curvature with respect to $\sigma_k$-curvature ($l&lt;k$). In particular, we prove the comparison holds for metrics close to strictly stable positive Einstein metric with $l&lt;\frac{n}{2}$. As for negative Einstein metrics, we prove a similar comparison result provided certain assumptions on sectional curvature holds for the manifold.</description>

      <title>The bi-Lipschitz constant of an isothermal coordinate chart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $C^{2}$-smooth Riemannian surface. A classical theorem in differential geometry states that the Gauss curvature function $K : M \to \mathbb{R}$ vanishes everywhere if and only if the surface is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane. We give an asymptotically sharp quantitative version of this theorem with respect to an isothermal coordinate chart. Roughly speaking, we show that if $B$ is a Riemannian disc of radius $\delta &gt; 0$ with $\delta^{2}\sup_{B}|K| &lt; \varepsilon$ for some $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$, then there is an isothermal coordinate map from $B$ onto an Euclidean disc of radius $\delta$ which is bi-Lipschitz with constant $\exp(4 \varepsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian Systems on Observation-Induced Fiber Bundles: Theory of Symmetry and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical constrained Hamiltonian theory assumes complete observability of system states, but in reality only partial state information is often available. This paper establishes a complete geometric theoretical framework for handling such incompletely observed systems. By introducing the concept of observation-induced fiber bundles, we naturally extend Dirac constraint theory to the fiber bundle setting, unifying the treatment of state constraints and observation constraints. Main results include: (1) Classification of existence conditions for observation fiber bundles based on characteristic class theory; (2) Complete characterization of Poisson structures on fiber bundles and corresponding symplectic reduction theory; (3) Geometric necessary and sufficient conditions for integrability and Lax pair construction; (4) Extension of Noether's theorem under symmetry group actions. The theoretical framework naturally encompasses a wide range of applications from classical mechanics to modern safety-critical control systems, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for dynamical analysis under incomplete information.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction and interpolation of manifolds II: Inverse problems with partial data for distances observations and for the heat kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider how a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ and its metric tensor $g$ can be approximately reconstructed from local distance measurements. Moreover, we consider an inverse problem of determining $(M,g)$ from limited knowledge on the heat kernel. In the part 1 of the paper, we considered the approximate construction of a smooth manifold in the case when one is given the noisy distances $\tilde d(x,y)=d(x,y)+\varepsilon_{x,y}$ for all points $x,y\in X$, where $X$ is a $\delta$-dense subset of $M$ and $|\varepsilon_{x,y}|&lt;\delta$. In this part 2 of the paper, we consider a similar problem with partial data, that is, the approximate construction of the manifold $(M,g)$ when we are given $\tilde d(x,y)$ for $x\in X$ and $y \in U\cap X$, where $U$ is an open subset of $M$. In addition, we consider the inverse problem of determining the manifold $(M,g)$ with non-negative Ricci curvature from noisy observations of the heat kernel $G(y,z,t)$. We show that a manifold approximating $(M,g)$ can be determined in a stable way, when for some unknown source points $z_j$ in $X\setminus U$, we are given the values of the heat kernel $G(y,z_k,t)$ for $y\in X\cap U$ and $t\in (0,1)$ with a multiplicative noise. We also give a uniqueness result for the inverse problem in the case when the data does not contain noise and consider applications in manifold learning. A novel feature of the inverse problem for the heat kernel is that the set $M\setminus U$ containing the sources and the observation set $U$ are disjoint.</description>

      <title>The classification of complete improper affine spheres with singularities of low total curvature and new examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a classification of complete improper affine spheres with singularities (say \emph{improper affine fronts}) in unimodular affine three-space $\boldsymbol{R}^3$ whose total curvature is greater than or equal to $-6\pi$, and a partial classification in the case of total curvature $-8\pi$. For the case of total curvature $-8\pi$, we give a complete classification for genus $0$ case and show the existence of an example and a one parameter family with genus $1$. We also study the asymptotic behavior of embedded ends of complete improper affine fronts. Moreover, we give new examples for this class of surfaces, including one which satisfies the equality condition of an Osserman-type inequality and is of positive genus.</description>

      <title>A new class of aesthetic curves based on the self-affinity in equiaffine geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider planar curves in equiaffine geometry and present a family of planar curves characterized by a symmetry called the extendable self-affinity (ESA). The ESA has been recognized through the investigation of the symmetry of the log-aesthetic curve (LAC), which has been studied as a reference for designing aesthetic shapes in CAGD and regarded as an analog of Euler's elastica in similarity geometry. Our new class, characterized by the ESA, includes the quadratic curve and the logarithmic spiral, a special case of the LAC. This implies that the new class can be regarded as an alternate class of ``aesthetic curves" in equiaffine geometry.</description>

      <title>Geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on simple surfaces or on spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue. If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely, if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in the known results on the Euclidean space.</description>
