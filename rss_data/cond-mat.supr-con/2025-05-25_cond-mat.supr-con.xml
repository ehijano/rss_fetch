      <title>Resolving Intervalley Gaps and Many-Body Resonances in Moir\'e Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene stands out as a highly tunable class of moir\'e materials that exhibit strong electronic correlations and robust superconductivity. However, understanding the relations between the low-temperature superconducting phase and the preceding correlated phases established at higher temperatures remains a challenge. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to track the formation sequence of correlated phases established by the interplay of dynamic correlations, intervalley coherence, and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). We discover the existence of two well-resolved gaps pinned at the Fermi level within the superconducting doping range. While the outer gap, previously associated with pseudogap phase, persists at high temperatures and magnetic fields, the newly revealed inner gap is more fragile in line with superconductivity MATTG transport experiments. Andreev reflection spectroscopy taken at the same location confirms a clear trend that closely follows the doping behaviour of the inner gap, and not the outer one. Moreover, spectroscopy taken at nanoscale domain boundaries further corroborates the contrasting behavior of the two gaps, with the inner gap remaining resilient to structural variations, as expected from the finite superconducting coherence length. By comparing our findings with recent topological heavy-fermion models, we identify that the outer gap originates from the splitting of the Abrikosov-Suhl-Kondo resonance due to the breaking of the valley symmetry arising from correlation-driven effects. Our results suggest an intricate but tractable hierarchy of correlated phases in twisted multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric origin of Meissner effect and superfluid weight marker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The momentum space of conventional superconductors is recently recognized to possess a quantum metric defined from the overlap of filled quasihole states at neighboring momenta. For multiband superconductors with arbitrary intraband and interband $s$-wave pairing, we elaborate that their superfluid weight in London equations is given by the momentum integration of the elements of quantum metric times the quasiparticle energy, indicating the quantum geometric origins of Meissner effect and vortex state. The momentum integration of the quantum metric further yields a spread of quasihole Wannier functions that characterizes the stability of the superconducting state. Our formalism allows the diamagnetic response of conventional superconductors to be mapped to individual lattice sites as a superfluid weight marker, which can incorporate the effect of disorder through self-consistently solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Using single-band $s$-wave superconductors in 2D and 3D as examples, our marker reveals a diamagnetic current that becomes turbulent in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities, and the increase of London penetration depth by disorder that is consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Altered Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground-state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.</description>

      <title>Superinsulating behavior in granular Pb film on gated few-layer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a super-insulating behavior, in a device having granular Pb film on back-gated few-layer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$, below an onset temperature same as the critical temperature $T_{\rm C}\approx7$ K of bulk Pb. Below $T_{\rm C}$, the current-voltage characteristics exhibit a threshold voltage marking a crossover between the low-bias insulating and the high-bias normal-resistance states, consistent with the known super-insulating state behavior. A temperature dependent critical magnetic field is also found above which the insulating behavior is suppressed. The threshold voltage is found to vary with the gate-voltage but the critical field remains unchanged. With reducing temperature, the sample conductance saturates to a finite value, which depends on magnetic field and gate-voltage. This saturation behavior is found to be inconsistent with the charge-BKT and the thermal activation models but it can be fitted well to a combination of thermal activation and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Majorana vortex phases in time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators and topologically trivial insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana vortex phases have been extensively studied in topological materials with conventional superconducting pairing. Inspired by recent experimental progress in realizing time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators (THOTIs) and inducing superconducting proximity effects, we investigate Majorana vortex phases in these systems. We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.</description>

      <title>Near-Unity Charge Readout in a Nonlinear Resonator without Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a nonlinear resonator performing the readout of a charge-sensing quantum dot. We show that by driving the resonator in the nonlinear regime, we achieve a near-unity signal. This despite not satisfying the impedance matching requirements necessary for such large signals in the linear regime. Our experiments, supported by numerical calculations, demonstrate that the signal increase stems from the sensor dissipation shifting the onset of the nonlinear resonator response. By lifting the matching requirement, we increase the bandwidth limit of resonator readout-based charge detection by an order of magnitude, opening up the avenue to ultra-fast charge detectors.</description>

      <title>Characterization of higher-order topological superconductors using Bott indices</title>

Abstract: The abundance of bulk and boundary topologies in higher-order topological phases offer remarkable tunability and diversity to boundary states but also pose a challenge to their unified topological characterization. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to characterize time-reversal invariant topological superconductors hosting Majorana Kramers pairs (MKP) of corner states by using a series of spin Bott indices, which capture both bulk and boundary states topology. The developed invariants can characterize MKP in arbitrarily shaped systems and all distinct spatial distribution patterns of MKP. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to analyze the Kane-Mele model with sublattice-dependent superconducting pairing potentials. In this representative model, both intrinsic and extrinsic higher-order topological superconductors can be realized and various patterns of MKP can be engineered through edge cleavage. Despite their high sensitivity to boundary terminations, MKP can be faithfully characterized by the proposed topological invariants. We further demonstrate the characterization of higher-order topological superconductors in the BDI symmetry class using Bott indices without resolving the spin degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Thermal Annealing and Radiation Effects on Structural and Electrical Properties of NbN/GaN Superconductor/Semiconductor Junctions</title>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 {\deg}C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 {\deg}C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 {\deg}C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.</description>
