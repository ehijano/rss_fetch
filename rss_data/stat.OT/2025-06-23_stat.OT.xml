      <title>The Landscape of College-level Data Visualization Courses, and the Benefits of Incorporating Statistical Thinking</title>

Abstract: Data visualization is a core part of statistical practice and is ubiquitous in many fields. Although there are numerous books on data visualization, instructors in statistics and data science may be unsure how to teach data visualization, because it is such a broad discipline. To give guidance on teaching data visualization from a statistical perspective, we make two contributions. First, we conduct a survey of data visualization courses at top colleges and universities in the United States, in order to understand the landscape of data visualization courses. We find that most courses are not taught by statistics and data science departments and do not focus on statistical topics, especially those related to inference. Instead, most courses focus on visual storytelling, aesthetic design, dashboard design, and other topics specialized for other disciplines. Second, we outline three teaching principles for incorporating statistical inference in data visualization courses, and provide several examples that demonstrate how to follow these principles. The dataset from our survey allows others to explore the diversity of data visualization courses, and our teaching principles give guidance for encouraging statistical thinking when teaching data visualization.</description>

      <title>Adaptive partition Factor Analysis</title>

Abstract: Factor Analysis has traditionally been utilized across diverse disciplines to extrapolate latent traits that influence the behavior of multivariate observed variables. Historically, the focus has been on analyzing data from a single study, neglecting the potential study-specific variations present in data from multiple studies. Multi-study factor analysis has emerged as a recent methodological advancement that addresses this gap by distinguishing between latent traits shared across studies and study-specific components arising from artifactual or population-specific sources of variation. In this paper, we extend the current methodologies by introducing novel shrinkage priors for the latent factors, thereby accommodating a broader spectrum of scenarios -- from the absence of study-specific latent factors to models in which factors pertain only to small subgroups nested within or shared between the studies. For the proposed construction we provide conditions for identifiability of factor loadings and guidelines to perform straightforward posterior computation via Gibbs sampling. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits competing performance across a variety of scenarios compared to existing methods, yet providing richer insights. The practical benefits of our approach are further illustrated through applications to bird species co-occurrence data and ovarian cancer gene expression data.</description>
