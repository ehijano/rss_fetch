      <title>Carrier-envelope phase effects in one- and two-photon directional photoionization of non-isotropic atomic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of two-color ($\omega$ and $2\omega$) co- and counter-rotating ultrashort attosecond laser pulses on non-isotropic atomic targets through the one- and two-photon interference pattern of the photoelectron spectrum. Specifically, we take the ground state of atomic carbon, i. e., $(1s^22s^22p^2,{}^3\text{P}^\text{e})$ as a prototype. We observe and quantify the strong dependency on the relative carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the two-color pulses and on the spatial orientation of the electronic target states. Notably, we observe that the photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) vary as a function of the CEP due to the interfering two-color one- and two-photon ionization paths. Besides, the PMD region corresponding to one-photon photoionization remains unaffected, with varying CEP, depending only on the ellipticity of the pulse, the central photon frequency and the magnetic quantum number of the initial state. Therefore, comparing the one-photon ionization electron ejection direction following absorption of a single ($2\omega$) photon with that of the two-photon ionization channel following absorption of two photon each with energy $\omega$ we may extrapolate information on the CEP difference between the two pulses.</description>

      <title>Efficient direct loading of the green MOT of Yb with low green laser power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the direct loading of Yb atoms in the magneto-optical trap (MOT) using the intercombination narrow optical transition 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ 6s6p $^3$P$_1$ at 556 nm (green), known as green MOT with limited power of green laser, 10 mW. Direct loading of the green MOT is achieved by superimposing the green laser beam, inside a hollow core of the laser beam driving the broad 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ 6s6p $^1$P$_1$, transition (blue) at 399 nm. We load up to 3$\times10^8$ in $1$ s. We characterize the green MOT loading with various experimental parameters such as magnetic field gradient, power of the green laser and blue MOT laser, and detuning of the green laser. We have also loaded the green MOT using center-shifted dual MOT configuration. In this configuration, the overlap region of the three counter-propagating blue laser beams is shifted towards Zeeman slower, where the magnetic field is non-zero. The atoms are first pre-cooled and partially trapped in blue MOT. These atoms enter the green MOT region and are trapped. In this method, we do not lose power (unlike in core-shell MOT) of the blue MOT laser because of masking the central portion. However, we load only 10$^7$ atoms, which has one order of magnitude fewer atoms than in the core-shell MOT.</description>

      <title>Comparison between Jacobi-Anger and saddle point methods to treat Above-threshold ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed comparison of theoretical approaches for modeling strong-field ionization by few-cycle laser pulses. The dipole approximation is shown to accurately capture interference structures in photoelectron spectra, while non-dipole effects introduce significant momentum shifts along the propagation direction. Two complementary analytical methods are used: the Jacobi-Anger expansion provides complete spectral decomposition of transition amplitudes, whereas the saddle-point method efficiently identifies dominant ionization pathways. Through this comparative study within the strong-field approximation framework, we establish validity conditions and practical advantages for each approach. Our results provide guidelines for selecting theoretical methods for advancing the interpretation of strong-field processes. These findings provide a roadmap for interpreting strong-field ionization spectra and momentum distributions, highlighting where non-dipole effects and method choice critically alter predictions.</description>

      <title>Large, ultra-flat optical traps for uniform quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atomic gases with uniform density can be created by flat-bottom optical traps. These gases provide an ideal platform to study many-body physics in a system that allows for simple connections with theoretical models and emulation of numerous effects from a wide range of fields of physics. In Earth-bound laboratories the trap sizes, number of species and states, as well as the range of physical effects are largely restricted by the adopted levitation technique. Homogeneous ultracold gases in microgravity simulators and space however offer an interesting perspective which is actively being pursued. To exploit the full potential of any gravity-compensated laboratory the box potentials created need to be as large as possible. By using two orthogonally aligned acousto-optic deflectors, we create large time-averaged optical potentials with trapping volumes a thousandfold larger than conventional setups, described by power-law scalings with exponents of up to $152$. We verify the performance of our setup by simulating the mean-field behaviour of a quantum gas ground state in conjunction with dynamical excitations due to the realistic time-dependent painting potentials. The implementation of this setup may open new directions at the interface with condensed matter, few-body Efimov physics or the exploration of critical, non-equilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Mega-FPS low light camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From biology and astronomy to quantum optics, there is a critical need for high frame rate, high quantum efficiency imaging. In practice, most cameras only satisfy one of these requirements. Here we introduce interlaced fast kinetics imaging, a technique that allows burst video acquisition at frame rates up to 3.33 Mfps using a commercial EMCCD camera with single-photon sensitivity. This approach leverages EMCCD's intrinsic fast row transfer dynamics by introducing a tilted lens array into the imaging path, creating a spatially distributed grid of exposed pixels, each aligned to its own column of the sensor. The remaining unexposed pixels serve as in-situ storage registers, allowing subsequent frames to be captured after just one row shift operation. Our interlaced fast kinetics camera maintains 50% contrast for square wave intensity modulation frequencies up to 1.61 MHz. We provide benchmarks of the video performance by capturing two dimensional videos of spatially evolving patterns that repeat every 2$\mu$s, with spatial resolution of 11$\times$15 pixels. Our approach is compatible with commercial EMCCDs and opens a new route to ultra-fast imaging at single-photon sensitivity with applications from fast fluorescence imaging to photon correlation measurement.</description>

      <title>Isolated elliptically-polarized attosecond pulse generation in gapped graphene driven by linearly polarized laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and its ellipticity in gapped graphene, driven by a femtosecond short-pulse laser at various orientation angles, employing the two-band density-matrix equations within the tight-binding approximation. The orientation-dependent harmonic spectra exhibit pronounced enhancement of specific harmonics, which we attribute to the caustic effect. Using the recombination trajectory model, we reveal that the orientation dependence of these enhanced harmonics originates from the distinct band structures encountered by electrons ionized from the two inequivalent $\textrm{K}$ points. Moreover, we focus on the ellipticity of the enhanced harmonics at specific angles and demonstrate that it primarily depends on the phase difference between the parallel and perpendicular components, which can be accurately predicted by our recombination trajectory model. Based on these insights, we propose a two-color (fundamental plus second-harmonic) field scheme to generate isolated elliptically polarized attosecond pulses (IEAPs) in gapped graphene. Our findings may provide a promising pathway toward the generation of IEAPs in gapped graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Protecting information in a parametrically driven hybrid quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>
