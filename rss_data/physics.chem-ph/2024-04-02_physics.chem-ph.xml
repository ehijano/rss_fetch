      <title>Deep Geometry Handling and Fragment-wise Molecular 3D Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most earlier 3D structure-based molecular generation approaches follow an atom-wise paradigm, incrementally adding atoms to a partially built molecular fragment within protein pockets. These methods, while effective in designing tightly bound ligands, often overlook other essential properties such as synthesizability. The fragment-wise generation paradigm offers a promising solution. However, a common challenge across both atom-wise and fragment-wise methods lies in their limited ability to co-design plausible chemical and geometrical structures, resulting in distorted conformations. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Deep Geometry Handling protocol, a more abstract design that extends the design focus beyond the model architecture. Through a comprehensive review of existing geometry-related models and their protocols, we propose a novel hybrid strategy, culminating in the development of FragGen - a geometry-reliable, fragment-wise molecular generation method. FragGen marks a significant leap forward in the quality of generated geometry and the synthesis accessibility of molecules. The efficacy of FragGen is further validated by its successful application in designing type II kinase inhibitors at the nanomolar level.</description>

      <title>UAlign: Pushing the Limit of Template-free Retrosynthesis Prediction with Unsupervised SMILES Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning poses a formidable challenge in the organic chemical industry, particularly in pharmaceuticals. Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial step in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years due to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of additional chemical knowledge dependency. This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence pipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and Transformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph structure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule structures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet effective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged structures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and semi-template-based approaches. Importantly, Our template-free method achieves effectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful template-based methods. Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free retrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of Transformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient utilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning mechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES tokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based approaches, with up to 5\% (top-5) and 5.4\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline.</description>

      <title>Grappa -- A Machine Learned Molecular Mechanics Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating large molecular systems over long timescales requires force fields that are both accurate and efficient. In recent years, E(3) equivariant neural networks have lifted the tension between computational efficiency and accuracy of force fields, but they are still several orders of magnitude more expensive than classical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields.
  Here, we propose a novel machine learning architecture to predict MM parameters from the molecular graph, employing a graph attentional neural network and a transformer with symmetry-preserving positional encoding. The resulting force field, Grappa, outperforms established and other machine-learned MM force fields in terms of accuracy at the same computational efficiency and can be used in existing Molecular Dynamics (MD) engines like GROMACS and OpenMM. It predicts energies and forces of small molecules, peptides, RNA and - showcasing its extensibility to uncharted regions of chemical space - radicals at state-of-the-art MM accuracy. We demonstrate Grappa's transferability to macromolecules in MD simulations, during which large protein are kept stable and small proteins can fold. Our force field sets the stage for biomolecular simulations close to chemical accuracy, but with the same computational cost as established protein force fields.</description>

      <title>A theoretical study on the mechanisms of formation of primal carbon clusters and nanoparticles in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational study of assembling carbon clusters and nanophases in space from carbon aggregations. Geometry optimizations and Density-functional-based tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) dynamics methods are employed to predict carbon clusters, their time evolution, and their stability. The initial density of the aggregates is found to be of primary importance for the structural properties of the clusters. Aggregates with sufficiently low initial density yield clusters with approximately equal prevalence of sp and sp2 hybridized states and almost missing sp3 ones. The increase in the initial density results in sp2-dominant molecules that resemble the carbon skeleton of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Larger initial aggregations with tetrahedral interatomic orientation result in sp2-dominant multi-dimensional polymers. Such materials are highly porous and resemble axially bound nanotubes. Some resultant clusters resemble fullerene building blocks. Spheroid nanoparticles resembling improper fullerenes are predicted by metadynamics, aimed at inter-fragment coupling reactions. One such structure has the lowest binding energy per atom among the studied molecules. All zero-dimensional forms, obtained by the simulations, conform to the experimentally detected types of molecules in space. The theoretical IR spectrum of the clusters closely resembles that of fullerene C70 and therefore such imperfect structures may be mistaken for known fullerenes in experimental infrared (IR) telescope studies.</description>

      <title>Electrical double layer and capacitance of TiO2 electrolyte interfaces from first principles simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical double layer (EDL) at aqueous solution-metal oxide interfaces critically affects many fundamental processes in electrochemistry, geology and biology, yet understanding its microscopic structure is challenging for both theory and experiments. Here we employ ab initio-based machine learning potentials including long-range electrostatics in large-scale atomistic simulations of the EDL at the TiO2-electrolyte interface. Our simulations provide a molecular-scale picture of the EDL that demonstrates the limitations of standard mean-field models. We further develop a method to accurately calculate the electrostatic potential drop at the interface. The computed capacitance originating from the adsorbed charges and the potential drop agrees with experiments, supporting the reliability of our description of the EDL. The larger interfacial capacitance of basic relative to acidic solutions originates from the higher affinity of the cations for the oxide surface and gives rise to distinct charging mechanisms on negative and positive surfaces.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the electronic terms of diatomic molecules by the Morse function. The role of anharmonicity. II. Simple terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article continues the series of works by the authors on the approximation of the electronic terms of diatomic molecules by the Morse formula, which is the simplest anharmonic approximation of the real term U(r). Depending on the choice of parameters, the approximation has two alternative solutions M1(r) and M2(r), with different patterns of deviations from the real term and its vibrational structure. The difference {\delta}(r)=U(r)-M(r) quantitatively shows the changes in the shape of the terms during approximation. We introduced an empirical anharmonicity function -2{\omega}_e x(v), which characterizes the positions of vibrational levels in the potential well; it demonstrates the distortion of the vibrational structure of the term U(r) during the approximation. Based on the data from literature, the functions {\delta}(r) and -2{\omega}_e x(v) were constructed for more than 20 molecules. Here we present a group of simple terms with minimal deviations from the Morse shape.</description>

      <title>Effect of cathode porosity on the Lithium air cell oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the practical air cathode in a Lithium air cell, which is conventionally composed of porous carbon with or without catalysts supported on it, was investigated. The mechanism and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied on a porous carbon electrode in an oxygen saturated solution of 0.1M Lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI) in Dimethoxyethane (DME) using cyclic voltammetery (CV) and the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The oxygen reduction and evolution reactions were found to occur at similar potentials to those observed on a smooth, planar glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The effect of the porosity and the resultant increase in surface area were readily observed in the increase in the transient time required for the intermediates to reach the ring and the much larger disk currents (compared to smooth, planar GC) recorded respectively. The RRDE data was analyzed using a kinetic model previously developed by us and the rate constant of the elementary reactions calculated. The rates constant for the electrochemical reactions were found to be similar in magnitude to the rate constants calculated for smooth GC disks. The porosity of the electrode was found to decrease the rate of desorption of the intermediate and the product and delay their diffusion by shifting it from a Fickian regime in the electrolyte bulk to the Knudsen regime in the film pores. Thus, it is shown that the effect of the electrode porosity on the kinetics of the ORR is physical rather than electrochemical.</description>

      <title>Methane and oxygen from energy-efficient, low temperature in situ resource utilization enables missions to Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA mandate is a human mission to Mars in the 2030s and sustained exploration of Mars requires in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Exploiting the Martian water cycle (alongside perchlorate salts that depress the freezing point of water to less than 213K) and the available 95 volume percent atmospheric CO2, we detail an ultra-low temperature (255K) CO2-H2O electrolyzer to produce methane fuel and life-supporting oxygen on Mars. Methane production is thermodynamically favored across a range of operational pressures and temperatures and our electrolyzer polarization model concurred with reported experimental performance. A hypothetical 10-cell, 100 square cm electrode-area-per-cell electrolyzer produced 0.31g per W per day of CH4 and 3.54g per W per day of O2 at 2V per cell (operating voltage) versus 0.8g per W per day of O2 produced by the Mars Oxygen in-situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) from the Mars 2020 mission (MOXIE produces no fuel). Material performance requirements are presented to show that this technology is an energy-efficient complement to the MOXIE high temperature approach.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of local environments in molecular crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying local structural motifs and packing patterns of molecular solids is a challenging task for both simulation and experiment. We demonstrate two novel approaches to characterize local environments in different polymorphs of molecular crystals using learning models that employ either flexibly learned or handcrafted molecular representations. In the first case, we follow our earlier work on graph learning in molecular crystals, deploying an atomistic graph convolutional network, combined with molecule-wise aggregation, to enable per-molecule environmental classification. For the second model, we develop a new set of descriptors based on symmetry functions combined with a point-vector representation of the molecules, encoding information about the positions as well as relative orientations of the molecule. We demonstrate very high classification accuracy for both approaches on urea and nicotinamide crystal polymorphs, and practical applications to the analysis of dynamical trajectory data for nanocrystals and solid-solid interfaces. Both architectures are applicable to a wide range of molecules and diverse topologies, providing an essential step in the exploration of complex condensed matter phenomena.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Driven Domain Adaptation for Generating 3D Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we train a molecule generator that can generate 3D molecules from a new domain, circumventing the need to collect data? This problem can be cast as the problem of domain adaptive molecule generation. This work presents a novel and principled diffusion-based approach, called GADM, that allows shifting a generative model to desired new domains without the need to collect even a single molecule. As the domain shift is typically caused by the structure variations of molecules, e.g., scaffold variations, we leverage a designated equivariant masked autoencoder (MAE) along with various masking strategies to capture the structural-grained representations of the in-domain varieties. In particular, with an asymmetric encoder-decoder module, the MAE can generalize to unseen structure variations from the target domains. These structure variations are encoded with an equivariant encoder and treated as domain supervisors to control denoising. We show that, with these encoded structural-grained domain supervisors, GADM can generate effective molecules within the desired new domains. We conduct extensive experiments across various domain adaptation tasks over benchmarking datasets. We show that our approach can improve up to 65.6% in terms of success rate defined based on molecular validity, uniqueness, and novelty compared to alternative baselines.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Synthesis of Carbon Nanotubes with Machine Learning Models and Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) are showing significant potential in various fields, such as electronics, energy, and mechanics. However, their practical applications face synthesis challenges stemming from the complexities of structural control, large-area uniformity, and high yield. Current research methodologies fall short in addressing the multi-variable, coupled interactions inherent to CBNs production. Machine learning methods excel at navigating such complexities. Their integration with automated synthesis platforms has demonstrated remarkable potential in accelerating chemical synthesis research, but remains underexplored in the nanomaterial domain. Here we introduce Carbon Copilot (CARCO), an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform that integrates transformer-based language models tailored for carbon materials, robotic chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and data-driven machine learning models, empowering accelerated research of CBNs synthesis. Employing CARCO, we demonstrate innovative catalyst discovery by predicting a superior Titanium-Platinum bimetallic catalyst for high-density horizontally aligned carbon nanotube (HACNT) array synthesis, validated through over 500 experiments. Furthermore, with the assistance of millions of virtual experiments, we achieved an unprecedented 56.25% precision in synthesizing HACNT arrays with predetermined densities in the real world. All were accomplished within just 43 days. This work not only advances the field of HACNT arrays but also exemplifies the integration of AI with human expertise to overcome the limitations of traditional experimental approaches, marking a paradigm shift in nanomaterials research and paving the way for broader applications.</description>

      <title>An atomic-scale perspective on individual thiol-terminated molecules anchored to single S vacancies in MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulphur vacancies in MoS$_2$ on Au(111) have been shown to be negatively charged as reflected by a Kondo resonance. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to show that these vacancies serve as anchoring sites for thiol-based molecules (CF$_3$-3P-SH) with two distinct reaction products, one of them showing a Kondo resonance. Based on comparisons with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, including a random structure search and computation of energies and electronic properties at a hybrid exchange-correlation functional level, we conclude that both anchored molecules are charge neutral. One of them is an anchored intact CF$_3$-3P-SH molecule while the other one is the result of catalytically activated dehydrogenation to CF$_3$-3P-S with subsequent anchoring. Our investigations highlight a perspective of functionalizing defects with thiol-terminated molecules that can be equipped with additional functional groups, such as charge donor- or acceptor-moieties, switching units or magnetic centers.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian Inference for Molecular Simulations using Local Gaussian Process Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Bayesian inference is the gold standard for uncertainty quantification and propagation, its use within physical chemistry encounters formidable computational barriers. These bottlenecks are magnified for modeling data with many independent variables, such as X-ray/neutron scattering patterns and electromagnetic spectra. To address this challenge, we apply a Bayesian framework accelerated via local Gaussian process (LGP) surrogate models. We show that the time-complexity of LGPs scales linearly in the number of independent variables, in stark contrast to the computationally expensive cubic scaling of conventional Gaussian processes. To illustrate the method, we trained a LGP surrogate model on the experimental radial distribution function of liquid neon, and observed a remarkable 288,000-fold speed-up compared to molecular dynamics with insignificant loss in predictive accuracy. We conclude that LGPs are robust and efficient surrogate models, poised to expand the application of Bayesian inference in molecular simulations to a broad spectrum of ever-advancing experimental data.</description>

      <title>Inverse Volume Scaling of Finite-Size Error in Periodic Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory is one of the most popular post-Hartree-Fock methods for ab initio molecular quantum chemistry. The finite-size error of the correlation energy in periodic coupled cluster calculations for three-dimensional insulating systems has been observed to satisfy the inverse volume scaling, even in the absence of any correction schemes. This is surprising, as simpler theories that utilize only a subset of the coupled cluster diagrams exhibit much slower decay of the finite-size error, which scales inversely with the length of the system. In this study, we review the current understanding of finite-size error in quantum chemistry methods for periodic systems. We introduce new tools that elucidate the mechanisms behind this phenomenon in the context of coupled cluster doubles calculations. This reconciles some seemingly paradoxical statements related to finite-size scaling. Our findings also show that singularity subtraction can be a powerful method to effectively reduce finite-size errors in practical quantum chemistry calculations for periodic systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Molecular Property Predictions with Graph Neural Architecture Search</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent class of data-driven methods for molecular property prediction. However, a key limitation of typical GNN models is their inability to quantify uncertainties in the predictions. This capability is crucial for ensuring the trustworthy use and deployment of models in downstream tasks. To that end, we introduce AutoGNNUQ, an automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach for molecular property prediction. AutoGNNUQ leverages architecture search to generate an ensemble of high-performing GNNs, enabling the estimation of predictive uncertainties. Our approach employs variance decomposition to separate data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainties, providing valuable insights for reducing them. In our computational experiments, we demonstrate that AutoGNNUQ outperforms existing UQ methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and UQ performance on multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally, we utilize t-SNE visualization to explore correlations between molecular features and uncertainty, offering insight for dataset improvement. AutoGNNUQ has broad applicability in domains such as drug discovery and materials science, where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for decision-making.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of transition-state theory for complex quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of quantum complex systems through a potential barrier is often described with transition-state theory, also known as RRKM theory in chemistry. Here we derive the basic formula for transition-state theory based on a generic Hamiltonian as might be constructed in a configuration-interaction basis. Two reservoirs of random Hamiltonians from Gaussian orthogonal ensembles are coupled to intermediate states representing the transition states at a barrier. Under the condition that the decay of the reservoirs to open channels is large, an analytic formula for reaction rates is derived. The transition states act as independent Breit-Wigner resonances which contribute additively to the total transition probability, as is well known for electronic conductance through resonant tunneling states. It is also found that the transition probability is independent of the decay properties of the states in the second reservoir over a wide range of decay widths.</description>

      <title>Explaining the thickness-dependent dielectric permittivity of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of thin films are of paramount important in a variety of technological applications, and of fundamental importance for solid state research. In spite of this, there is currently no theoretical understanding of the dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the thickness of thin films. We develop a confinement model within the Lorentz-field framework for the microscopic Langevin-equation description of dielectric response in terms of the atomic-scale vibrational modes of the solid. Based on this, we derive analytical expressions for the dielectric permittivity as a function of thin film thickness, in excellent agreement with experimental data of Barium-Strontium-Titanate (BST) thin films of different stoichiometry. The theory shows that the decrease of dielectric permittivity with decreasing thickness is directly caused by the restriction in $k$-space of the available eigenmodes for field-induced alignment of ions and charged groups.</description>
