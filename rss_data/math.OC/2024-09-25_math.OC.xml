      <title>Optimization-based Verification of Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions: A Branch-and-Bound Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) form a powerful control theoretic tool to guarantee safety and synthesize safe controllers for discrete-time dynamical systems. In this paper, we provide an optimization-based algorithm, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of a candidate DTCBF, i.e., either verifying a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifying it by providing a counterexample for a general nonlinear discrete-time system with input constraints. This method is applicable whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We apply our method to a numerical case study to illustrate its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo integration for feedback control under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control in feedback form is derived for linear quadratic, time-invariant optimal control problems subject to parabolic partial differential equations with coefficients depending on a countably infinite number of uncertain parameters. It is shown that the Riccati-based feedback operator depends analytically on the parameters provided that the system operator depends analytically on the parameters, as is the case, for instance, in diffusion problems when the diffusion coefficient is parameterized by a Karhunen--Lo\`eve expansion. These novel parametric regularity results allow the application of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to efficiently compute an a-priori chosen feedback law based on the expected value. Moreover, under moderate assumptions on the input random field, QMC methods achieve superior error rates compared to ordinary Monte Carlo methods, independently of the stochastic dimension of the problem. Indeed, our paper for the first time studies Banach-space-valued integration by higher-order QMC methods.</description>

      <title>A minimal compact description of the diversity index polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phylogenetic tree is an edge-weighted binary tree, with leaves labelled by a collection of species, that represents the evolutionary relationships between those species. For such a tree, a phylogenetic diversity index is a function that apportions the biodiversity of the collection across its constituent species. The diversity index polytope is the convex hull of the images of phylogenetic diversity indices. We study the combinatorics of phylogenetic diversity indices to provide a minimal compact description of the diversity index polytope. Furthermore, we discuss extensions of the polytope to expand the study of biodiversity measurement.</description>

      <title>Trust-Region Sequential Quadratic Programming for Stochastic Optimization with Random Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider solving optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Sequential Quadratic Programming method to find both first- and second-order stationary points. Our method utilizes a random model to represent the objective function, which is constructed from stochastic observations of the objective and is designed to satisfy proper adaptive accuracy conditions with a high but fixed probability. To converge to first-order stationary points, our method computes a gradient step in each iteration defined by minimizing a quadratic approximation of the objective subject to a (relaxed) linear approximation of the problem constraints and a trust-region constraint. To converge to second-order stationary points, our method additionally computes an eigen step to explore the negative curvature of the reduced Hessian matrix, as well as a second-order correction step to address the potential Maratos effect, which arises due to the nonlinearity of the problem constraints. Such an effect may impede the method from moving away from saddle points. Both gradient and eigen step computations leverage a novel parameter-free decomposition of the step and the trust-region radius, accounting for the proportions among the feasibility residual, optimality residual, and negative curvature. We establish global almost sure first- and second-order convergence guarantees for our method, and present computational results on CUTEst problems, regression problems, and saddle-point problems to demonstrate its superiority over existing line-search-based stochastic methods.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Approach to Shape Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mesh-free and direct method for computing the shape derivative in PDE-constrained shape optimization problems. Our approach is based on a probabilistic representation of the shape derivative and is applicable for second- order semilinear elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions and a general class of target functions. The probabilistic representation derives from an extension of a boundary sensitivity result for diffusion processes due to Costantini, Gobet and El Karoui [14]. Moreover, we present a simulation methodology based on our results that does not necessarily require a mesh of the relevant domain, and provide Taylor tests to verify its numerical accuracy</description>

      <title>Examples of slow convergence for adaptive regularization optimization methods are not isolated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptive regularization algorithm for unconstrained nonconvex optimization was shown in Nesterov and Polyak (2006) and Cartis, Gould and Toint (2011) to require, under standard assumptions, at most $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{3/(3-q)})$ evaluations of the objective function and its derivatives of degrees one and two to produce an $\epsilon$-approximate critical point of order $q\in\{1,2\}$. This bound was shown to be sharp for $q \in\{1,2\}$. This note revisits these results and shows that the example for which slow convergence is exhibited is not isolated, but that this behaviour occurs for a subset of univariate functions of nonzero measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and uniqueness of the mild solutions and the exact null controllability for a class of non-autonomous parabolic evolution systems with nonlocal conditions in Hilbert spaces. We present sufficient conditions for achieving exact null controllability in these systems using the theory of linear evolution systems and the Schauder fixed point theorem. Importantly, our results do not require the compactness or Lipschitz conditions for the function \( g \) in the nonlocal conditions, which are often needed in other studies. We also provide an example to demonstrate the practical application of our results.</description>

      <title>Empirically Exploring the Space of Monostationarity in Dual Phosphorylation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual phosphorylation network provides an essential component of intracellular signaling, affecting the expression of phenotypes and cell metabolism. For particular choices of kinetic parameters, this system exhibits multistationarity, a property that is relevant in the decision-making of cells. Determining which reaction rate constants correspond to monostationarity and which produce multistationarity is an open problem. The system's monostationarity is linked to the nonnegativity of a specific polynomial. A previous study by Feliu et al. provides a sufficient condition for monostationarity via a decomposition of this polynomial into nonnegative circuit polynomials. However, this decomposition is not unique. We extend their work by a systematic approach to classifying such decompositions in the dual phosphorylation network. Using this result classification, we provide a qualitative comparison of the decompositions into nonnegative circuit polynomials via empirical experiments and improve on previous conditions for the region of monostationarity.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Exogenous Structure for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) known as Exo-MDPs, characterized by a partition of the state space into two components. The exogenous states evolve stochastically in a manner not affected by the agent's actions, whereas the endogenous states are affected by the actions, and evolve in a deterministic and known way conditional on the exogenous states. Exo-MDPs are a natural model for various applications including inventory control, finance, power systems, ride sharing, among others. Despite seeming restrictive, this work establishes that any discrete MDP can be represented as an Exo-MDP. Further, Exo-MDPs induce a natural representation of the transition and reward dynamics as linear functions of the exogenous state distribution. This linear representation leads to near-optimal algorithms with regret guarantees scaling only with the (effective) size of the exogenous state space $d$, independent of the sizes of the endogenous state and action spaces. Specifically, when the exogenous state is fully observed, a simple plug-in approach achieves a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}\sqrt{dK})$, where $H$ denotes the horizon and $K$ denotes the total number of episodes. When the exogenous state is unobserved, the linear representation leads to a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}d\sqrt{K})$. We also establish a nearly matching regret lower bound of $\Omega(Hd\sqrt{K})$ for the no observation regime. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental study on inventory control problems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Graph Theoretic Methods for Enhancing Network Robustness in Robot Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization of edge-weighted networks by maximizing algebraic connectivity to enhance network robustness. Motivated by the need for precise robot position estimation in cooperative localization and pose-graph sparsification in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), the algebraic connectivity maximization problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Semi-Definite Program (MISDP), which is NP-hard. Leveraging spectral graph theoretic methods, specifically Cheeger's inequality, this work introduces novel "Cheeger cuts" to strengthen and efficiently solve medium-scale MISDPs. Further, a new Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) is developed for efficiently computing Cheeger cuts, implemented within an outer-approximation algorithm for solving the MISDP. A greedy k-opt heuristic is also presented, producing high-quality solutions that serve as valid lower bounds for Cheeger cuts. Comprehensive numerical analyses demonstrate the efficacy of strengthened cuts via substantial improvements in run times on synthetic and realistic robot localization datasets.</description>

      <title>Another look at the control properties of the Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper represents a new perspective in understanding the controllability of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation on unbounded domains. By studying the equation on both the right and left half-line with a single control input, we show that a class of solutions exists for which the KdV equation is exactly controllable. This is achieved by introducing a new concept known as \textit{operational controllability}, which provides key insights for establishing exact controllability results for the KdV equation. This approach allows explicitly characterizing both the control input and the controllable solutions. Furthermore, this concept holds significant potential for application to a wide range of nonlinear dispersive equations on the half-line and in bounded intervals.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Bandit Nonconvex Optimization with One-Point Residual Feedback via Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed online bandit optimization problem with nonconvex loss functions over a time-varying digraph. This problem can be viewed as a repeated game between a group of online players and an adversary. At each round, each player selects a decision from the constraint set, and then the adversary assigns an arbitrary, possibly nonconvex, loss function to this player. Only the loss value at the current round, rather than the entire loss function or any other information (e.g. gradient), is privately revealed to the player. Players aim to minimize a sequence of global loss functions, which are the sum of local losses. We observe that traditional multi-point bandit algorithms are unsuitable for online optimization, where the data for the loss function are not all a priori, while the one-point bandit algorithms suffer from poor regret guarantees. To address these issues, we propose a novel one-point residual feedback distributed online algorithm. This algorithm estimates the gradient using residuals from two points, effectively reducing the regret bound while maintaining $\mathcal{O}(1)$ sampling complexity per iteration. We employ a rigorous metric, dynamic regret, to evaluate the algorithm's performance. By appropriately selecting the step size and smoothing parameters, we demonstrate that the expected dynamic regret of our algorithm is comparable to existing algorithms that use two-point feedback, provided the deviation in the objective function sequence and the path length of the minimization grows sublinearly. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimization of partially isolated quantum harmonic oscillator memory systems by mean square decoherence time criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum harmonic oscillators with position-momentum system variables, whose internal dynamics and interaction with the environment are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations. A recently proposed approach to such systems as Heisenberg picture quantum memories exploits their ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a decoherence horizon. Using the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation of the system variables from their initial values, we apply this approach to a partially isolated subsystem of the oscillator, which is not directly affected by the external fields. The partial isolation leads to an appropriate system decomposition and a qualitatively different short-horizon asymptotic behaviour of the deviation, which yields a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit. The resulting approximate decoherence time maximization over the energy parameters for improving the quantum memory performance is discussed for a coherent feedback interconnection of such systems.</description>

      <title>Ionization detail parameters and cluster dose: A mathematical model for selection of nanodosimetric quantities for use in treatment planning in charged particle radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To propose a mathematical model for applying Ionization Detail (ID), the detailed spatial distribution of ionization along a particle track, to proton and ion beam radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP). Approach: Our model provides for selection of preferred ID parameters (I_p) for RTP, that associate closest to biological effects. Cluster dose is proposed to bridge the large gap between nanoscopic I_p and macroscopic RTP. Selection of I_p is demonstrated using published cell survival measurements for protons through argon, comparing results for nineteen Ip: N_k; k = 2,3,...,10, the number of ionizations in clusters of k or more per particle, and F_k; k = 1,2,...,10, the number of clusters of k or more per particle. We then describe application of the model to ID-based RTP and propose a path to clinical translation. Main results: The preferred I_p were N_4 and F_5 for aerobic cells, N_5 and F_7 for hypoxic cells. Signifcant differences were found in cell survival for beams having the same LET or the preferred N_k. Conversely, there was no signi?cant difference for F_5 for aerobic cells and F_7 for hypoxic cells, regardless of ion beam atomic number or energy. Further, cells irradiated with the same cluster dose for these I_p had the same cell survival. Based on these preliminary results and other compelling results in nanodosimetry, it is reasonable to assert that I_p exist that are more closely associated with biological effects than current LET-based approaches and microdosimetric RBE-based models used in particle RTP. However, more biological variables such as cell line and cycle phase, as well as ion beam pulse structure and rate still need investigation. Signifcance: Our model provides a practical means to select preferred I_p from radiobiological data, and to convert I_p to the macroscopic cluster dose for particle RTP.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Leaning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for massive-scale systems consisting of large populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments has witnessed a significant surge in recent years across diverse scientific domains. However, due to the large-scale nature of the system, the majority of state-of-the-art RL techniques either encounter high computational cost or exhibit compromised performance. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture along with the derivation of effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for any arbitrarily large system of agents. Specifically, we model such a system as a parameterized control system defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform to map the parameterized system and the value function of an RL problem into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation subsequently generates a finite-dimensional moment representation for this RL problem. Leveraging this representation, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. We further enhance efficiency of the algorithm by exploiting early stopping at each hierarchy, by which we show the fast convergence property of the algorithm through constructing a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples.</description>

      <title>Preserving positivity of Gauss-Newton Hessian through random sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerically the reconstructability of unknown parameters in inverse problems heavily relies on the chosen data. Therefore, it is crucial to design an experiment that yields data that is sensitive to the parameters. We approach this problem from the perspective of a least squares optimization, and examine the positivity of the Gauss-Newton Hessian at the global minimum point of the objective function. We propose a general framework that provides an efficient down-sampling strategy that can select data that preserves the strict positivity of the Hessian. Matrix sketching techniques from randomized linear algebra is heavily leaned on to achieve this goal. The method requires drawing samples from a certain distribution, and gradient free sampling methods are integrated to execute the data selection. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in selecting sensor locations for Schr\"odinger potential reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Identifying early tumour states in a Cahn-Hilliard-reaction-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of reconstructing earlier tumour configurations starting from a single spatial measurement at a later time. We describe the tumour evolution through a diffuse interface model coupling a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation for the tumour phase field to a reaction-diffusion equation for a key nutrient proportion, also accounting for chemotaxis effects. We stress that the ability to reconstruct earlier tumour states is crucial for calibrating the model used to predict the tumour dynamics and also to identify the areas where the tumour initially began to develop. However, backward-in-time inverse problems are well-known to be severely ill-posed, even for linear parabolic equations. Moreover, we also face additional challenges due to the complexity of a non-linear fourth-order parabolic system. Nonetheless, we can establish uniqueness by using logarithmic convexity methods under suitable a priori assumptions. To further address the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, we propose a Tikhonov regularisation approach that approximates the solution through a family of constrained minimisation problems. For such problems, we analytically derive the first-order necessary optimality conditions. Finally, we develop a computationally efficient numerical approximation of the optimisation problems by employing standard $C^0$-conforming first-order finite elements. We conduct numerical experiments on several pertinent test cases and observe that the proposed algorithm consistently meets expectations, delivering accurate reconstructions of the original ground truth.</description>

      <title>A sparsified Christoffel function for high-dimensional inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Christoffel polynomials are classical tools from approximation theory. They can be used to estimate the (compact) support of a measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ based on its low-degree moments. Recently, they have been applied to problems in data science, including outlier detection and support inference. A major downside of Christoffel polynomials in such applications is the fact that, in order to compute their coefficients, one must invert a matrix whose size grows rapidly with the dimension $d$. In this paper, we propose a modification of the Christoffel polynomial which is significantly cheaper to compute, but retains many of its desirable properties. Our approach relies on sparsity of the underlying measure $\mu$, described by a graphical model. The complexity of our modification depends on the treewidth of this model.</description>

      <title>Robust Neural IDA-PBC: passivity-based stabilization under approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we restructure the Neural Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity Based Control (Neural IDA-PBC) design methodology, and we formally analyze its closed-loop properties. Neural IDA-PBC redefines the IDA-PBC design approach as an optimization problem by building on the framework of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, the closed-loop stability and robustness properties under Neural IDA-PBC remain unexplored. To address the issue, we study the behavior of classical IDA-PBC under approximations. Our theoretical analysis allows deriving conditions for practical and asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium point. Moreover, it extends the Neural IDA-PBC applicability to port-Hamiltonian systems where the matching conditions cannot be solved exactly. Our renewed optimization-based design introduces three significant aspects: i) it involves a novel optimization objective including stability and robustness constraints issued from our theoretical analysis; ii) it employs separate Neural Networks (NNs), which can be structured to reduce the search space to relevant functions; iii) it does not require knowledge about the port-Hamiltonian formulation of the system's model. Our methodology is validated with simulations on three standard benchmarks: a double pendulum, a nonlinear mass-spring-damper and a cartpole. Notably, classical IDA-PBC designs cannot be analytically derived for the latter.</description>

      <title>CrowdSurfer: Sampling Optimization Augmented with Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder for Dense Crowd Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation amongst densely packed crowds remains a challenge for mobile robots. The complexity increases further if the environment layout changes, making the prior computed global plan infeasible. In this paper, we show that it is possible to dramatically enhance crowd navigation by just improving the local planner. Our approach combines generative modelling with inference time optimization to generate sophisticated long-horizon local plans at interactive rates. More specifically, we train a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder to learn a prior over the expert trajectory distribution conditioned on the perception input. At run-time, this is used as an initialization for a sampling-based optimizer for further refinement. Our approach does not require any sophisticated prediction of dynamic obstacles and yet provides state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we compare against the recent DRL-VO approach and show a 40% improvement in success rate and a 6% improvement in travel time.</description>

      <title>Zero-Sum State-Blind Stochastic Games with Vanishing Stage Duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In stochastic games with stage duration h, players act at times 0, h, 2h, and so on. The payoff and leaving probabilities are proportional to h. As h approaches 0, such discrete-time games approximate games played in continuous time. The behavior of the values when h tends to 0 was already studied in the case of stochastic games with perfect observation of the state. We examine the same question for the case of state-blind stochastic games. Our main finding is that, as h approaches 0, the value of any state-blind stochastic game with stage duration h converges to the unique viscosity solution of a partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Approximation of shape optimization problems with non-smooth PDE constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a shape optimization problem governed by a non-smooth PDE, i.e., the nonlinearity in the state equation is not necessarily differentiable. We follow the functional variational approach of [40] where the set of admissible shapes is parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. This methodology allows for both boundary and topological variations. It has the advantage that one can rewrite the shape optimization problem as a control problem in a function space. To overcome the lack of convexity of the set of admissible controls, we provide an essential density property. This permits us to show that each parametrization associated to the optimal shape is the limit of global optima of non-smooth distributed optimal control problems. The admissible set of the approximating minimization problems is a convex subset of a Hilbert space of functions. Moreover, its structure is such that one can derive strong stationary optimality conditions [6]. The present manuscript provides the basis for the investigations from [5], where necessary conditions in form of an optimality system have been recently established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.05922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do you remember your first video game console? We remember ours. Decades ago, they provided hours of entertainment. Now, we have repurposed them to solve dynamic and stochastic optimization problems. With deep reinforcement learning methods posting superhuman performance on a wide range of Atari games, we consider the task of representing a classic logistics problem as a game. Then, we train agents to play it. We consider several game designs for the vehicle routing problem with stochastic requests. We show how various design features impact agents' performance, including perspective, field of view, and minimaps. With the right game design, general purpose Atari agents outperform optimization-based benchmarks, especially as problem size grows. Our work points to the representation of dynamic and stochastic optimization problems via games as a promising research direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of inexact Newton methods is studied for solving generalized equations on Riemannian manifolds by using the metric regularity property, which is also explored. Under appropriate conditions and without any additional geometric assumptions, local convergence results with linear and quadratic rates, as well as a semi-local convergence result, are obtained for the proposed method. Finally, the theory is applied to the problem of finding a singularity for the sum of two vector fields. In particular, the KKT system for the constrained Riemannian center of mass on the sphere is explored numerically.</description>

      <title>Measure propagation along a $\mathscr{C}^0$-vector field and wave controllability on a rough compact manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Rauch-Taylor/Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch geometric control condition is central in the study of the observability of the wave equation linking this property to high-frequency propagation along geodesics that are therays of geometric optics. This connection is best understood through the propagation properties of microlocal defect measures that appear as solutions to the wave equation concentrate. For a sufficiently smooth metric this propagation occurs along the bicharacteristic flow. If one considers a merely $\mathscr{C}^1$-metric this bicharacteristic flow may however not exist. The Hamiltonian vector field is only continuous; bicharacteristics do exist (as integral curves of this continuous vector field) but uniqueness is lost. Here, on a compact manifold without boundary, we consider this low regularity setting, revisit the geometric control condition, and address the question of support propagation for a measure solution to an ODE with continuous coefficients. This leads to a sufficient condition for the observability and equivalently the exact controllability of the wave equation. Moreover, we investigate the stabililty of the observability property and the sensitivity of the control process under a perturbation of the metric of regularity as low as Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally tractable algorithm for learning infinite-horizon average-reward linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) and linear mixture MDPs under the Bellman optimality condition. While guaranteeing computational efficiency, our algorithm for linear MDPs achieves the best-known regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\mathrm{sp}(v^*)\sqrt{T})$ over $T$ time steps where $\mathrm{sp}(v^*)$ is the span of the optimal bias function $v^*$ and $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping. For linear mixture MDPs, our algorithm attains a regret bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\cdot\mathrm{sp}(v^*)\sqrt{T})$. The algorithm applies novel techniques to control the covering number of the value function class and the span of optimistic estimators of the value function, which is of independent interest.</description>
