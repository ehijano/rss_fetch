      <title>Ponzi Funds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many active funds hold concentrated portfolios. Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which pushes up the funds' existing positions resulting in realized returns. We decompose fund returns into a price pressure (self-inflated) and a fundamental component and show that when allocating capital across funds, investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are self-inflated or fundamental. Because investors chase self-inflated fund returns at a high frequency, even short-lived impact meaningfully affects fund flows at longer time scales. The combination of price impact and return chasing causes an endogenous feedback loop and a reallocation of wealth to early fund investors, which unravels once the price pressure reverts. We find that flows chasing self-inflated returns predict bubbles in ETFs and their subsequent crashes, and lead to a daily wealth reallocation of 500 Million from ETFs alone. We provide a simple regulatory reporting measure -- fund illiquidity -- which captures a fund's potential for self-inflated returns.</description>

      <title>Piercing the Veil of TVL: DeFi Reappraised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total value locked (TVL) is widely used to measure the size and popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, the prevalent TVL calculation framework suffers from a "double counting" issue that results in an inflated metric. We find existing methodologies addressing double counting either inconsistent or flawed. To solve this, we formalize the TVL framework and propose a new framework, total value redeemable (TVR), to accurately assess the true value within DeFi. TVL formalization reveals how DeFi's complex network spreads financial contagion via derivative tokens, amplifying liquidations and stablecoin depegging in market downturns. We construct the DeFi multiplier to quantify the double counting, which mirrors the money multiplier in traditional finance (TradFi). Our measurement finds substantial double counting in DeFi. During the peak of DeFi activity on December 2, 2021, the difference between TVL and TVR was \$139.87 billion, with a TVL-to-TVR ratio of about 2. We further show that TVR is a more stable metric than TVL, especially during market downturns. A 25% decline in the price of Ether (ETH) leads to a \$1 billion greater non-linear decrease in TVL compared to TVR. We also observe a substitution effect between TradFi and DeFi.</description>
