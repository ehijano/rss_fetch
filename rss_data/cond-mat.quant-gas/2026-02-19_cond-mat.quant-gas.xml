      <title>How Subradiance Enables Nonlinearity in Weakly Driven Quantum Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing the nonlinear response of a medium is essential for applications including frequency conversion and light amplification, as well as for the generation of quantum many-body correlations of light or matter. However, achieving these effects typically requires high drive intensities and thick samples, which induce undesired heating effects that typically suppress quantum correlations. In this work, we demonstrate that atom-thin arrays of quantum emitters exhibit a robust nonlinear response even at arbitrarily weak drive intensities. This discovery challenges the long-held assumption that weakly driven ensembles behave classically; instead, we reveal that subradiant states provide a dominant nonlinear contribution that persists in the low-intensity limit. Using a Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) approach, we predict that these nonlinearities generate a quantum-correlated steady state composed of interacting pairs of subradiant excitations, characterized by long-range correlations and multi-mode squeezing. Our findings establish a new frontier for nonlinear quantum optics at minimal power, and provide a scalable protocol for preparing multimode squeezing, offering potential for applications in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Effects of intertube dipole-dipole interactions in nearly integrable one-dimensional $^{162}$Dy gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of the intertube dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) in recent experiments with arrays of nearly integrable one-dimensional (1D) dipolar Bose gases of $^{162}$Dy atoms. An earlier theoretical modeling ignored those interactions, which we include here via a modification of the 1D confining potentials. We investigate the effects of the intertube DDI both during the state preparation and during the measurements of the rapidity distributions. We explore how the strength of the contact interactions and the magnetic field angles modify the intertube DDI corrections. We find that those corrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and the rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each other, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to those predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI.</description>

      <title>Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We numerically map out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and {trimer} phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. Within the explored ranges of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths, the in-vacuum three-body states are always more deeply bound than the two-body ones. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper {trimer} phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.</description>

      <title>Stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures in two dimensions: a lowest-order constrained variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of mechanical stability in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature, focusing on systems with a tunable Bose-Fermi (BF) interaction and a weak but finite boson-boson (BB) repulsion. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions.</description>

      <title>The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry and Majorana strong zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. Finally, we develop quantum circuit realizations of our model paving the way towards the creation of exact Majorana strong zero modes with digital quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in quantum chemistry, correlated materials, atomic physics, molecular dynamics, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on Surfaces of Variable Negative Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <title>Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.</description>
