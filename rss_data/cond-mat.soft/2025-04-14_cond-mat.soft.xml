      <title>Influence of the particle morphology on the spray characteristics in low-pressure cold gas process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of particle morphology on spray characteristics in low-pressure cold gas spraying (LPCGS) by analyzing three copper powders with distinct shapes and microstructures. A comprehensive morphology analysis was conducted using both 2D and 3D imaging techniques. Light microscopy combined with image processing quantified particle circularity in 2D projections, while X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) enabled precise 3D reconstructions to determine sphericity, surface area, and volume distributions. The results showed significant variations in the particle morphology of the investigated feedstock copper powders, with irregularly shaped particles exhibiting lower circularity and sphericity compared to more spherical feedstocks. These morphological differences had a direct impact on the particle velocity distributions and spatial dispersion within the spray jet, as measured by high-speed particle image velocimetry. Irregular particles experienced stronger acceleration and exhibited a more focused spray dispersion, whereas spherical particles reached lower maximum velocities and showed a wider dispersion in the jet. These findings highlight the critical role of particle morphology in optimization of cold spray processes for advanced coating and additive manufacturing applications.</description>

      <title>Fringe around a Beet Slice: Wetting-induced Dimple in a Thin Liquid Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a slice of beet is placed on a plate with a thin layer of beet juice, one can observe a clear fringe around the beet, where the color is more translucent than the rest of the juice. The hypotheses in literature were inconsistent and limited, which motivated us to revisit this phenomenon. Using a motorized confocal displacement sensor, we measured the temporal evolution of the liquid surface profile across the fringe. Our findings suggest that a suction flow, induced by the capillary rise of the contact line, causes a dimple - a small concave depression - to form on the liquid surface. While surface tension and gravity tends to smooth out the dimple, viscous drag acts against them if the liquid film is sufficiently thin. Our scaling analysis correctly estimates the dependence of dimple lifetime on liquid properties and film thickness. We also capture the dimple formation dynamics by numerically solving the lubrication equation with the Young-Laplace equation. This work provides a new interpretation for a common phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of soft valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08248v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft valves serve to modulate and rectify flows in complex vasculatures across the tree of life, e.g. in the heart of every human reading this. Here we consider a minimal physical model of the heart mitral valve modeled as a flexible conical shell capable of flow rectification via collapse and coaptation in an impinging (reverse) flow. Our experiments show that the complex elastohydrodynamics of closure features a noise-activated rectification mechanism. A minimal theoretical model allows us to rationalize our observations while illuminating a dynamical bifurcation driven by stochastic hydrodynamic forces. Our theory also suggests a way to trigger the coaptation of soft valves on demand, which we corroborate using experiments, suggesting a design principle for their efficient operation.</description>

      <title>A mesoscopic model for the rheology of dilute and semidilute solutions of wormlike micelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest possible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with sticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each other at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of lengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a bending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that stick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such polydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic interactions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent worms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike micellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration regimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration are examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field predictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length distribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy. The presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the static properties of linear wormlike micelles, and mean-field predictions of ring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss moduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency regime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The distinction between Rouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions is elucidated, with a clear identification of the onset of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions with increasing concentration.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of bidisperse attractive particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bidisperse particle systems are common in both natural and engineered materials, and it is known to influence packing, flow, and stability. However, their direct effect on elastic properties, particularly in systems with attractive interactions, remains poorly understood. Gaining insight into this relationship is important for designing soft particle-based materials with desired mechanical response. In this work, we study how particle size ratio and composition affect the shear modulus of attractive particle systems. Using coarse-grained molecular simulations, we analyze systems composed of two particle sizes at fixed total packing fraction and find that the shear modulus increases systematically with bidispersity. To explain this behavior, we develop two asymptotic models following limiting cases: one where a percolated network of large particles is stiffened by small particles, and another where a small-particle network is modified by embedded large particles. Both models yield closed-form expressions that capture the qualitative trends observed in simulations, including the dependence of shear modulus on size ratio and relative volume fraction. Our results demonstrate that bidispersity can enhance elastic stiffness through microstructural effects, independently of overall density, offering a simple strategy to design particle-based materials with tunable mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Lift force in chiral, compressible granular matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. However, existing formulations often overlook the contribution of finite odd viscosity, which is a natural occurrence in chiral micropolar fluids where parity and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In this work, we specifically explore the influence of odd viscosity on the lift forces -- a less commonly discussed force compared to drag -- experienced by a bead immersed in a compressible micropolar fluid. We analyze the lift forces on a bead embedded within a compressible flow of a granular medium, emphasizing the unique role and interplay of microrotations and odd viscosity.</description>

      <title>Clifford algebras and liquid crystalline fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Clifford algebras provide a natural language to describe the physics of liquid crystal defects in 3D. This framework shows that most of these defects have fermionic nature, as the director field profile on a 2D cross section can algebraically be represented by a spinor. Defects in uniaxial, biaxial nematics and cholesterics are represented by elements belonging to different Clifford algebras, suggesting that there are fundamental distinctions between topological defects in each of these phases. Our theory allows nematic defects to be interpreted as Majorana-like spinors, as defects and antidefects are topologically equivalent, whilst some cholesteric defects, such as screw dislocations, are better viewed as Weyl-like spinors of well-defined chirality. Defects can be described by a ``defect bivector'', an algebraic element which quantifies the rototranslation associated with them. In cholesterics, fermionic defects of different types can combine to yield composite quasiparticles with either fermionic or bosonic nature. Under cylindrical confinement, these quasiparticles provide the way to understand the structure of screw dislocations. In the bulk, they may condensate to form topological phases, such as blue phases or skyrmion lattices. Our results provide a surprising link between liquid crystals, particle physics, and topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a chiral active fluid of inertial self-spinning disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that systematic particle rotations in a fluid composed of disk-shaped spinners can spontaneously lead to phase separation. The phenomenon arises out of a homogeneous and hydrostatic stationary state, due to a pressure feedback mechanism that increases local density fluctuations. We show how this mechanism induces phase separation, coined as Rotation Induced Phase Separation (RIPS), when the active rotation is not properly counterbalanced by translational friction. A low density phase can coexist with a dense chiral liquid due to the imbalance between pressure and stress transmitted through chiral flows when a significant momentum transfer between rotational and translational motion can be sustained. As a consequence, RIPS is expected to appear generically in chiral fluids.</description>

      <title>Reentrant transition to collective actuation in active solids with a polarizing field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective actuation takes place in active solids when the dynamics spontaneously condensates on a few elastic modes. This condensation results from an elasto-active feedback between the deformations of the structure and the orientations of forces exerted by the active units. An external field that polarizes these forces is thus likely to strongly affect the transition to collective actuation. Here, we study the dynamics of elastically coupled polar active units in the presence of such a field, through a combination of model experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis. Experimentally, we observe that tilting the plane of the experiment polarizes the orientation of the active units and thereby the forces they exert on the elastic structure. Taking advantage of this gravity-induced polarization, we uncover a novel oscillatory regime, distinct from the different oscillating regimes observed in the zero-field limit. The theoretical analysis of the dynamics for a single agent demonstrates that the two oscillating dynamics in the presence of a field map onto the bounded and unbounded phase dynamics of a weighing pendulum. In the many agents case, we observe experimentally and numerically, and demonstrate theoretically, that the polarizing field may facilitate the transition to collective actuation, leading to a reentrant transition.</description>

      <title>Collective actuation in active solids in the presence of a polarizing field: a review of the dynamical regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective actuation in active solids, the spontaneous condensation of the dynamics on a few elastic modes, takes place whenever the deformations of the structure reorient the forces exerted by the active units composing, or embedded in, the solid. In a companion paper, we show through a combination of model experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis that adding an external field that polarizes the active forces strongly affects the dynamical transition to collective actuation. A new oscillatory regime emerges, and a reentrance transition to collective actuation takes place. Depending on the degenerate, or non-degenerate, nature of the modes on which the dynamics condensates; depending on the orientation of the polarizing field with respect to the stiff or soft direction of the solid, several new dynamical regimes can be observed. The purpose of the present paper is to review these dynamical regimes in a comprehensive way, both for the single-particle dynamics and for the coarse-grained one. Whenever possible the dynamical regimes and the transition between them are described analytically, otherwise numerically.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control in Soft and Active Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft and active condensed matter represent a class of fascinating materials that we encounter in our everyday lives -- and constitute life itself. Control signals interact with the dynamics of these systems, and this influence is formalized in control theory and optimal control. Recent advances have employed various control-theoretical methods to design desired dynamics, properties, and functionality. Here we provide an introduction to optimal control aimed at physicists working with soft and active matter. We describe two main categories of control, feedforward control and feedback control, and their corresponding optimal control methods. We emphasize their parallels to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and provide a worked example problem. Finally, we review recent studies of control in soft, active, and related systems. Applying control theory to soft, active, and living systems will lead to an improved understanding of the signal processing, information flows, and actuation that underlie the physics of life.</description>

      <title>A Generic Explanation of the Mechanism of Co-solvency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer behavior in mixed solvents often exhibits intriguing phenomena, such as cosolvency, where a polymer that collapses in two individually poor solvents becomes soluble in their mixture. In this study, we employ a combination of theoretical modeling and computer simulations using a generic polymer solution model to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving this behavior. Moving beyond conventional explanations based on solvent-cosolvent immiscibility or chemistry-specific interactions, our findings highlight the critical role of mismatches in solvophobicity and solvation strength between the polymer and the two solvent components. We demonstrate that co-solvency arises from the interplay between van der Waals interactions and specific associations, such as hydrogen bonding. The bulk phase behavior of the solution is also examined, and the resulting phase diagram, calculated using Flory-Huggins theory, shows good agreement with experimental observations. This study offers a generalized framework for understanding polymer cosolvency across diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Intracellular phagosome shell is rigid enough to transfer outside torque to the inner spherical particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracellular phagosomes have a lipid bilayer encapsulated fluidic shell outside the particle, on the outer side of which, molecular motors are attached. An optically trapped spherical birefringent particle phagosome provides an ideal platform to probe fluidity of the shell, as the inner particle is optically confined both in translation and in rotation. Using a recently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations - yielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1 degrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest a new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and pitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent particle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the activity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell. Applying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show that this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a signature of broken detailed balance.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation; polyhedron reconstruction; 3d scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Not only is the geometry of rock fragments often well approximated by ideal convex polyhedra having few faces and vertices, but these numbers carry vital geophysical information on the fragmentation process. Despite their significance, the identification of the ideal polyhedron has so far been carried out through visual inspection. Here, we present an algorithm capable of performing this task in a reliable manner. The input is a 3D scan of the fragment which is essentially a triangulated polyhedron, which however has often large number of faces and vertices. Our algorithm performs a systematic simplification using the following steps: - Gaussian smoothing is performed on the spherical histogram of the 3D scans faces to identify the most important face orientations. - Planes carrying the faces of the ideal polyhedron are identified as maxima of the smoothed histogram - Polygon is reconstructed using the identified planes - Small faces are removed in a systematic manner We present two versions of the algorithm that we benchmarked the algorithm against a dataset of human measurements on 132 fragments. Beyond identifying the ideal polyhedral approximation for fragments, our method is also capable of tracing backward the shape evolution of rounded pebbles to their origins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of self-propelled colloidal particles are strongly influenced by their environment through hydrodynamic and, in many cases, chemical interactions. We develop a theoretical framework to describe the motion of confined active particles by combining the Lorentz reciprocal theorem with a Galerkin discretisation of surface fields, yielding an equation of motion that efficiently captures self-propulsion without requiring an explicit solution for the bulk fluid flow. Applying this framework, we identify and characterise the long-time behaviours of a Janus particle near rigid, permeable, and fluid-fluid interfaces, revealing distinct motility regimes, including surface-bound skating, stable hovering, and chemo-hydrodynamic reflection. Our results demonstrate how the solute permeability and the viscosity contrast of the surface influence a particle's dynamics, providing valuable insights into experimentally relevant guidance mechanisms for autophoretic particles. The computational efficiency of our method makes it particularly well-suited for systematic parameter sweeps, offering a powerful tool for mapping the phase space of confined active particles and informing high-fidelity numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Sociohydrodynamics: data-driven modelling of social behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially-generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our simple hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation-integration transition even with memory-less agents. This suggests an explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood's population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.</description>

      <title>Piecewise linear constitutive relations for stretch-limited elastic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a simple and novel class of stretch-limiting constitutive relations for perfectly flexible elastic strings drawing from modern advances in constitutive theory for elastic bodies. We investigate strings governed by constitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of tension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework. Our analysis includes explicit solutions for both catenaries and longitudinal, piecewise constant stretched motions.</description>
