      <title>Time Invariant Sensor Tasking for Catalog Maintenance of LEO Space objects using Stochastic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalog maintenance of space objects by limited number of ground-based sensors presents a formidable challenging task to the space community. This article presents a methodology for time-invariant tracking and surveillance of space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) by optimally directing ground sensors. Our methodology aims to maximize the expected number of space objects from a set of ground stations by utilizing concepts from stochastic geometry, particularly the Poisson point process. We have provided a systematic framework to understand visibility patterns and enhance the efficiency of tracking multiple objects simultaneously. Our approach contributes to more informed decision-making in space operations, ultimately supporting efforts to maintain safety and sustainability in LEO.</description>

      <title>Challenge-Based Funding to Spark Origins Breakthroughs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origins of life research is marred by ambiguous questions and goals, creating uncertainty about when research objectives have been achieved. Because of numerous unknowns and disagreements about definitions and theories, the field lacks clear markers of progress. We argue that the origins community should focus on goals that have agreed-upon meaning and can be consensually categorized as achieved or unachieved. The origins community needs these goals to maintain coherence amongst a federation of problems with the shared, but nebulous aspiration of understanding the origins of life. We propose a list of challenges with clear 'Finish Lines'--explicit descriptions of what will be achieved if each goal is reached--similar to the X-prize model. The intent is not to impose top-down research directions, but to compel the community to coalesce around explicit problems of the highest priority, as physics, astronomy, and planetary science communities do when setting science objectives for missions and megaprojects. Even if the generated phenomena are not unequivocally life-like, demonstrating systems that achieve these goals will sharpen the distinction between life itself and the constellation of phenomena that co-occur with life.

      <title>Satellite Constellations Exceed the Limits of Acceptable Brightness Established by the IAU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brightness statistics for satellites of the Starlink, BlueBird, Qianfan, Guowang and OneWeb constellations are reported. The means and standard deviations are compared to acceptable limits set by the International Astronomical Union's Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky From Satellite Constellations Interference. Nearly all these spacecraft exceed the magnitude 7+ brightness limit pertaining to interference with professional research. Most also exceed the magnitude 6 reference where they distract from aesthetic appreciation of the night sky.</description>

      <title>Testing Origin-of-Life Theories with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to telescopically constrain the frequency and abundance of biospheres in the solar neighborhood. Origin-of-life theories vary in their predictions for the environmental requirements and the expected frequency of abiogenesis, meaning that constraints on the frequency and distribution of life on exoplanets from HWO can in principle directly test theories of abiogenesis. We categorize origin-of-life theories into three broad classes and discuss how HWO could potentially test them. Nondetection of biology on a large sample of habitable planets would provide prior-independent evidence in favor of the class of abiogenesis theory which holds that the origin of life is a contingent, vanishingly unlikely event, whereas detection of event a single biosphere would falsify this class of theories. Correlations of candidate biospheres with planetary parameters such as UV irradiation, the presence of oceans, and the presence of continents can test specific origin-of-life theories. Simulated surveys with Bayesian analysis are required to quantify the ability of HWO to execute this science case. However, a clear theme from the limited such studies that have already been conducted is the need for large sample sizes ($\gtrsim50$ planets characterized) to provide meaningful constraints on abiogenesis theories, favoring a larger design sample for HWO.</description>

      <title>Prebiosignatures with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to characterize habitable exoplanets in search of signs of life. However, detectable life may be rare, either because abiogenesis is intrinsically contingent and unlikely, or because biospheres may efficiently recycle their products. Here, we explore the potential of HWO to test theories of life in the universe even if detectable life is rare by searching for "prebiosignature gases". Prebiosignatures gases are gases whose detection constrains theories of the evolution of prebiotic (habitable but uninhabited) planets, thereby testing theories of abiogenesis and guiding laboratory investigations of the origin of life. We catalog 5 theories of prebiotic environments that are potentially testable by HWO, identify their observational tests, and rank them by perceived detection plausibility. The prebiosignature paradigm is novel and potentially compelling, but considerable work is required to mature it and assess its practical relevance for HWO, especially simulated spectral observation and retrieval studies. However, consideration of the absorption properties of prebiosignature observables alone reveals that coverage at NUV wavelengths (200-400 nm) will be required to effectively realize a prebiosignature science case for HWO, supporting the argument for UV capabilities for HWO.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Cherenkov Photon Background for Low-Noise Silicon Detectors in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future space observatories that seek to perform imaging and spectroscopy of faint astronomical sources will require ultra-low-noise detectors that are sensitive over a broad wavelength range. Silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs), such as EMCCDs, skipper CCDs, multi-amplifier sensing (MAS) CCDs, and single-electron sensitive read out (SiSeRO) CCDs have demonstrated the ability to detect and measure single photons from X-ray energies to near the silicon band gap (~1.1 $\mu$m), making them candidate technologies for this application. In this context, we study a relatively unexplored source of low-energy background coming from Cherenkov radiation produced by energetic cosmic rays traversing a silicon detector. We present a model for Cherenkov photon production and absorption that is calibrated to laboratory data, and we use this model to characterize the residual background rate for ultra-low-noise silicon detectors in space. We study how the Cherenkov background rate depends on detector thickness, variations in solar activity, and the contribution of heavy cosmic ray species (Z &gt; 2). We find that for thick silicon detectors, such as those required to achieve high quantum efficiency at long wavelengths, the rate of cosmic-ray-induced Cherenkov photon production is comparable to other detector and astrophysical backgrounds. We apply our Cherenkov background model to simulated spectroscopic observations of extra-solar planets, and we find that thick detectors continue to outperform their thinner counterparts at longer wavelengths despite a larger Cherenkov background rate. Furthermore, we find that minimal masking of cosmic-ray tracks continues to maximize the signal-to-noise of very faint sources despite the existence of extended halos of Cherenkov photons.</description>

      <title>The Instrumental Background of EP/FXT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-flight instrumental background of the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) onboard Einstein Probe (EP) mission is analysed in this work by utilizing observations collected during Performance Verification phase and subsequent dedicated filter wheel closed observations. The instrumental backgrounds of the two FXT modules are consistent with each other, with an average rate of $\sim 4\times10^{-2}$\,counts/s/keV at 0.5--10\,keV for each module. The background is nearly uniformly distributed across the detector pixels, with a minor increase ($&lt;8\%$) observed along rows. The spatial distribution shows significant modulation by the geomagnetic field. The spectral shapes remain unchanged in 0.5--10\,keV at different rates. The long-term temporal variation indicates a periodic change associated with the orbital precession ($\sim 57$ days). The innovative design of FXT full-frame readout mode enables simultaneous recording of events in both the imaging area (IMG) and the frame store area (FSA) of the pnCCD. FSA event rates show a strong linear correlation with the IMG, based on which the IMG instrumental background modelling is established.</description>

      <title>Neural translation for Stokes inversion and synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] The physical conditions in stellar atmospheres can be obtained from the interpretation of solar spectro-polarimetric observations. However, traditional inversion codes are computationally demanding, especially for lines whose formation is complex. The necessity of faster alternatives has motivated the emergence of machine learning solutions. This paper introduces an approach to the inversion and synthesis of Stokes profiles inspired by neural machine translation. Our aim is to develop a generative model that treats Stokes profiles and atmospheric models as two distinct ``languages'' encoding the same physical reality. We build a model that learns how to translate between them, also providing estimates of the uncertainty. We employ a tokenization strategy for both Stokes parameters and model atmospheres, which is learned using a VQ-VAE, a neural model used to compress the data into a lower dimensionality form. The core of our inversion code utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to perform the translation between these tokenized representations. The model is trained on a database of synthetic Stokes profiles derived from perturbations to various semi-empirical solar atmospheric models, ensuring a wide range of expected solar physical conditions. The method effectively reconstructs atmospheric models from observed Stokes profiles, showing better constrained models within the region of sensitivity of the considered spectral lines. The latent representation induced by the VQ-VAE helps accelerate the inversion by compressing the length of the Stokes profiles and model atmospheres. Additionally, it helps regularize the solution by reducing the chances of obtaining unphysical models. As a final advantage, the method provides the generative nature of our model, which naturally yields an estimate of the uncertainty in the solution.</description>

      <title>Template-Fitting Meets Deep Learning: Redshift Estimation Using Physics-Guided Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift estimation is critical for observational cosmology, especially in large-scale surveys where spectroscopic measurements are impractical. Traditional approaches include template fitting and machine learning, each with distinct strengths and limitations. We present a hybrid method that integrates template fitting with deep learning using physics-guided neural networks. By embedding spectral energy distribution templates into the network architecture, our model encodes physical priors into the training process. The system employs a multimodal design, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse photometric and image data, along with Bayesian layers for uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our model on the publicly available PREML dataset, which includes approximately 400,000 galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam PDR3 release, with 5-band photometry, multi-band imaging, and spectroscopic redshifts. Our approach achieves an RMS error of 0.0507, a 3-sigma catastrophic outlier rate of 0.13%, and a bias of 0.0028. The model satisfies two of the three LSST photometric redshift requirements for redshifts below 3. These results highlight the potential of combining physically motivated templates with data-driven models for robust redshift estimation in upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Test mass charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space based on UV micro-LED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an alternative to the ultraviolet light emitting diode(UV LED), the feasibility of utilizing UV micro-LED in the charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space is experimentally studied. Compared with UV LED, micro-LED is more compact in size, has better current spreading, faster response time and longer operating life. Performance characteristics of micro-LEDs were measured, with peak wavelength of 254 nm, 262 nm, 274 nm, and 282 nm for each respective micro-LED, and the photoelectric effect was demonstrated. The effectiveness of micro-LED based charge management experiments were demonstrated using above micro-LEDs mounted on a cubical test mass, and different discharge rates were achieved by varying the drive current and duty cycle using pulse width modulation(PWM). Laboratory data was also shown to demonstrate the space qualification of the micro-LED device, the key electrical and optical characteristics of the micro-LEDs showed less than 5% variation. The results of the qualification bring the micro-LED device Technology Readiness Level(TRL) to TRL-5. TRL-6 will be reached provided additional radiation and thermal tests are conducted and in a position ready to be flown and further tested in space.</description>

      <title>Dark from light (DfL): Inferring halo properties from luminous tracers with machine learning trained on cosmological simulations. I. Method, proof of concept &amp; preliminary testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Dark from Light (DfL) - a novel method to infer the dark sector in wide-field galaxy surveys, leveraging a machine learning approach trained on contemporary cosmological simulations. The aim of this algorithm is to provide a fast, straightforward, and accurate route to estimating dark matter halo masses and group membership in wide-field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. This approach requires a highly limited number of input parameters and yields full probability distribution functions for the output halo masses. To achieve this, we train a series of Random Forest (RF) regression models on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations at z=0-3, which provide model-dependent mappings from luminous tracers to dark matter halo properties. We incorporate the individual regression models into a virial group-finding algorithm (DfL), which outputs halo properties for observational-like input data. We test the method at z=0-2 for both the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG models, as well as in a cross-validation mode. We demonstrate that known halo masses can be recovered with a mean systematic bias of $\langle b \rangle = \pm 0.10\,$dex (resulting from simulation choice), a mean statistical uncertainty of $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.12 \,$dex across epochs, and a central - (core) satellite classification accuracy of 96%. We establish that this approach yields superior halo mass recovery to standard abundance matching applied to groups identified through a friends-of-friends algorithm. Additionally, we compare the outputs of DfL to observational constraints on the $M_* - M_{\rm Halo}$ relation from strong gravitational lensing at $z \sim 0$, demonstrating the promise of this novel approach. Finally, we systematically quantify how DfL performs on observational-like input data with varying stellar mass uncertainty and spectroscopic incompleteness, enabling robust error calibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TRIDENT experiment is a planned neutrino observatory at West Pacific Ocean to search for astrophysical neutrinos. The final full-scale detector array is expected to have about 1000 strings, each of which consists of 20 hybrid digital optical modules. Each module will contain a number of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers to detect Cherenkov lights. In this paper, we present a custom designed digitization mainboard for the TRIDENT experiment. It includes PMT waveform digitization at a sampling rate of 125 MS/s using commercial analog-to-digital converters, and time digitization using time-to-digital converters implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We present its design and the first performances.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric model-trained machine learning selection and classification of ultracool TY dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics. Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) at later types. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO 2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of magnitude larger than any empirical set of &gt;T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of known UCDs with object classification metrics &gt;99% and an average spectral type precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5 degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from photometric catalogs.</description>

      <title>Extended source fringe flats for the JWST MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detectors of the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) form low-finesse resonating cavities that cause periodic count rate modulations (fringes) with peak amplitudes of up to 15% for sources external to MIRI. To detect weak features on a strong continuum and reliably measure line fluxes and line-flux ratios, fringe correction is crucial. This paper describes the first of two steps implemented in the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline, which is the division by a static fringe flat that removes the bulk of the fringes for extended sources. Fringe flats were derived by fitting a numerical model to observations of spatially extended sources. The model includes fringes that originate from two resonating cavities in the detector substrate (a third fringe component that originates from the dichroic filters is not included). The model, numerical implementation, and resulting fringe flats are described, and the efficiency of the calibration was evaluated for sources of various spatial extents on the detector. Flight fringe flats are obtained from observations of the planetary nebula NGC 7027. The two fringe components are well recovered and fitted by the model. The derived parameters are used to build a fringe flat for each MRS spectral band, except for 1A and 1B due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of NGC 7027 in these bands. When applied to extended sources, fringe amplitudes are reduced to the sub-percent level on individual spaxels. For point sources, they are reduced to amplitudes of 1 to 5% considering individual spaxels and a single dither position, and decrease to the 1 to 2% level after two-dimensional residual fringe correction. The fringe flats derived from this work are the reference files currently in use by the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline. They provide an efficient calibration for extended sources, and are less efficient for point sources.</description>

      <title>Fast detection and reconstruction of merging Massive Black Hole Binary signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational waves from the population of merging massive black holes binaries (MBHBs) throughout the Universe. The LISA data stream will feature many superposed signals from different astrophysical sources, requiring a global fit procedure. Most of the MBHB signals will be loud enough to be detected days or even weeks before the merger; and for those sources LISA will be able to predict the time of the merger well in advance of the coalescence, as well as an approximate position in the sky. In this paper, we present a fast detection and signal reconstruction scheme for massive black hole binaries in the LISA observation band. We propose: (i) a detection scheme for MBHB mergers allowing a first subtraction of these signals for the purpose of a global fit, and (ii) an efficient early detection scheme providing a time-of-merger estimate for a pre-merger signal, that will allow to trigger a protection period, placing LISA in ``do not disturb'' mode and enabling more detailed analysis that will facilitate multi-messenger observations. We highlight the effect of confusion of several overlapping in time MBHB signals in the pre-merger detection.</description>

      <title>Stellar ejection velocities from the binary supernova scenario: A comparison across population synthesis codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of binary systems are disrupted at the moment of the first supernova, resulting in an unbound compact object and companion star. These ejected companion stars contribute to the observed population of runaway stars. Therefore, an understanding of their ejection velocities is essential to interpreting observations, particularly in the Gaia era of high-precision astronomy.
  We present a comparison of the predicted ejection velocities of disrupted binary companions in three different population synthesis codes: COSMIC, COMPAS, and binary_c, which use two independent algorithms for the treatment of natal kicks. We confirm that, despite the codes producing different pre-supernova evolution from the same initial conditions, they each find the ejection velocities of secondary stars from disrupted binaries are narrowly distributed about their pre-supernova orbital velocity. We additionally include a correction to the derivation included in Kiel &amp; Hurley 2009 that brings it into agreement with methods from other works for determining post-supernova binary orbital parameters. During this comparison, we identified and resolved bugs in the kick prescriptions of \textit{all three} codes we considered, highlighting how open-science practices and code comparisons are essential for addressing implementation issues.</description>
