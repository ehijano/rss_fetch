      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling with Three Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is there a fixed dimension $n$ such that translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is undecidable? Several recent results support a positive answer to this question. Greenfeld and Tao disprove the periodic tiling conjecture by showing that an aperiodic monotile exists in sufficiently high dimension $n$ [Ann. Math. 200(2024), 301-363]. In another paper [to appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc.], they also show that if the dimension $n$ is part of the input, then the translational tiling for subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with one tile is undecidable. These two results are very strong pieces of evidence for the conjecture that translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is undecidable, for some fixed $n$. This paper gives another supportive result for this conjecture by showing that translational tiling of the $4$-dimensional space with a set of three connected tiles is undecidable.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Formalisms for Representing Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a longstanding dispute over which formalism is the best for representing knowledge in AI. The well-known "declarative vs. procedural controversy" is concerned with the choice of utilizing declarations or procedures as the primary mode of knowledge representation. The ongoing debate between symbolic AI and connectionist AI also revolves around the question of whether knowledge should be represented implicitly (e.g., as parametric knowledge in deep learning and large language models) or explicitly (e.g., as logical theories in traditional knowledge representation and reasoning). To address these issues, we propose a general framework to capture various knowledge representation formalisms in which we are interested. Within the framework, we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms, and prove that all universal formalisms are recursively isomorphic. Moreover, we show that all pairwise intertranslatable formalisms that admit the padding property are also recursively isomorphic. These imply that, up to an offline compilation, all universal (or natural and equally expressive) representation formalisms are in fact the same, which thus provides a partial answer to the aforementioned dispute.</description>

      <title>A (1.999999)-approximation ratio for vertex cover problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertex cover problem is a famous combinatorial problem, and its complexity has been heavily studied. While a 2-approximation for it can be trivially obtained, researchers have not been able to approximate it better than 2-o(1). In this paper, by introducing a new semidefinite programming formulation that satisfies new properties, we introduce an approximation algorithm for the vertex cover problem with a performance ratio of 1.999999 on arbitrary graphs, en route to answering an open question about the correctness of the unique games conjecture.</description>

      <title>Maximum $k$- vs. $\ell$-colourings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00440v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present polynomial-time SDP-based algorithms for the following problem: For fixed $k \leq \ell$, given a real number $\epsilon&gt;0$ and a graph $G$ that admits a $k$-colouring with a $\rho$-fraction of the edges coloured properly, it returns an $\ell$-colouring of $G$ with an $(\alpha \rho - \epsilon)$-fraction of the edges coloured properly in polynomial time in $G$ and $1 / \epsilon$. Our algorithms are based on the algorithms of Frieze and Jerrum [Algorithmica'97] and of Karger, Motwani and Sudan [JACM'98].
  When $k$ is fixed and $\ell$ grows large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $\alpha = 1 - o(1 / \ell)$. When $k, \ell$ are both large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $\alpha = 1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell - o(\ln \ell / k \ell) - O(1 / k^2)$; if we fix $d = \ell - k$ and allow $k, \ell$ to grow large, this is $\alpha = 1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell - o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$.
  By extending the results of Khot, Kindler, Mossel and O'Donnell [SICOMP'07] to the promise setting, we show that for large $k$ and $\ell$, assuming Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (\UGC), it is \NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio $\alpha$ greater than $1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell + o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$, provided that $\ell$ is bounded by a function that is $o(\exp(\sqrt[3]{k}))$. For the case where $d = \ell - k$ is fixed, this bound matches the performance of our algorithm up to $o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$. Furthermore, by extending the results of Guruswami and Sinop [ToC'13] to the promise setting, we prove that it is \NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio greater than $1 - 1 / \ell + 8 \ln \ell / k \ell + o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$, provided again that $\ell$ is bounded as before (but this time without assuming the \UGC).</description>
