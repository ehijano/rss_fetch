      <title>Normal/inverse Doppler effect of backward volume magnetostatic spin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves (SWs) and their quanta, magnons, play a crucial role in enabling low-power information transfer in future spintronic devices. In backward volume magnetostatic spin waves (BVMSWs), the dispersion relation shows a negative group velocity at low wave numbers due to dipole-dipole interactions and a positive group velocity at high wave numbers, driven by exchange interactions. This duality complicates the analysis of intrinsic interactions by obscuring the clear identification of wave vectors. Here, we offer an innovative approach to distinguish between spin waves with varying wave vectors more effectively by the normal/inverse spin wave Doppler effect. The spin waves at low wave numbers display an inverse Doppler effect because their phase and group velocities are anti-parallel. Conversely, at high wave numbers, a normal Doppler effect occurs due to the parallel alignment of phase and group velocities. Analyzing the spin wave Doppler effect is essential for understanding intrinsic interactions and can also help mitigate serious interference issues in the design of spin logic circuits.</description>

      <title>p-(001)NiO/n-(0001)ZnO Heterostructures based Ultraviolet Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of epitaxial (001)p-NiO/(0001)n-ZnO heterostructures grown on (0001)sapphire substrates by pulsed laser deposition technique for ultraviolet photodetector application. Our study reveals that in the self-powered mode, these devices can serve as effective photodetectors for the UV-A band (320-400 nm) with response time as short as 400 microseconds. Peak responsivity as high as 5mA/W at zero bias condition have been achieved. These devices also show a very high level of stability under repeated on/off illumination cycles over a long period of time. Furthermore, we find that the response time of these detectors can be controlled from several microseconds to thousands of seconds by applying bias both in the forward and the reverse directions. This persistent photoconductivity effect has been explained in terms of the field induced change in the capture barrier height associated with certain traps located at the junction.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast cascade charge transfer in multi bandgap colloidal quantum dot solids enables threshold reduction for optical gain and stimulated emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving low-threshold infrared stimulated emission in solution-processed quantum dots is critical to enable real-life application including photonic integrated circuits (PICs), LIDAR application and optical telecommunication. However, realization of low threshold infrared gain is fundamentally challenging due to high degeneracy of the first emissive state (e.g., 8-fold) and fast Auger recombination. In this letter, we demonstrate ultralow-threshold infrared stimulated emission with an onset of 110 uJ.cm-2 employing cascade charge transfer (CT) in Pb-chalcogenide colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solids. In doing so, we investigate this idea in two different architectures including a mixture of multiband gap CQDs and layer-by-layer (LBL) configuration. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we show ultrafast cascade CT from large band-gap PbS CQD to small band-gap PbS/PbSSe core/shell CQDs in LBL (~ 2 ps) and mixture (~ 9 ps) configuration. These results indicate the feasibility of using cascade CT as an efficient method to reduce optical gain threshold in CQD solid films.</description>

      <title>Long-distance Liquid Transport Along Fibers Arising From Plateau-Rayleigh Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid mobility on fibers is critical to the effectiveness of fiber matrices in face masks, water harvesting and aerosol filtration, but is typically affected by Plateau-Rayleigh instability. However, the spontaneous flow within precursor films arising from this instability has been largely overlooked, particularly regarding its fundamental flow pattern and the potential for liquid mobilization. This study reveals the pivotal role of spontaneous flow on ribbon-like fibers in enhancing liquid transport. The non-axisymmetric curvature of these fibers induces long-wave instabilities, generating a sustained flow that enables film-wise transport over centimeter-scale distances at velocities of several millimeters per second. Using particle-image velocimetry, we uncover intricate hydrodynamics, including opposing flows within the film and organized vortices in the shear layer, driven by capillary effects at the liquid-vapor interfaces. Building on these insights, we demonstrate a network structure capable of achieving planar liquid transport over a 10 cm2 area. The ribbon-like fibers investigated exhibit the longest transport distances relative to biomimetic structures and aerodynamic propulsion. The unique transport dynamics and planar configuration of the fiber matrix offer substantial potential for advanced fiber-based liquid transport systems, with enhanced mass/heat transfer, laminar mixing and aerodynamic characteristics.</description>

      <title>Silver Telluride Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors and Image Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photodetectors that are sensitive in shortwave infrared (SWIR) range (1 um - 2 um) are of significant interest for applications in 3D, night and adverse weather imaging, machine vision and autonomous driving, among others. Currently available technologies in the SWIR rely on costly epitaxial semiconductors that are not monolithically integrated with CMOS electronics. Solution-processed quantum dots can address this challenge by enabling low-cost manufacturing and simple monolithic integration on silicon in a back-end-of-line (BEOL) process. To date, colloidal quantum dot (CQD) materials to access the SWIR are mostly based on lead sulfide (PbS) and mercury telluride (HgTe) compounds, imposing major regulatory concerns and impeding their deployment in consumer electronics due to toxicity concerns. Here we report a new synthesis method for environmentally-friendly silver telluride (Ag2Te) quantum dots and their application in high-performance SWIR photodetectors. The CQD photodetector stack employs materials compliant with the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (RoHS) directives and is sensitive in the spectral range from 350 nm - 1600 nm. The room-temperature detectivity is of the order 1012 Jones, the 3dB bandwidth is in excess of 0.1 MHz and the linear dynamic range is over 118 dB. We also realize a monolithically integrated SWIR imager based on solution processed, heavy-metal-free materials, thus paving the way of this technology to consumer electronics market.</description>

      <title>All-Electrical Layer-Spintronics in Altermagnetic Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current is highly desirable yet tremendously challenging in developing ultracompact spintronic device technology. Here we propose a scheme to realize the all-electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current in an altermagnetic bilayer. Such a bilayer system can host layer-spin locking, in which one layer hosts a spin-polarized current while the other layer hosts a current with opposite spin polarization. An out-of-plane electric field breaks the layer degeneracy, leading to a gate-tunable spin-polarized current whose polarization can be fully reversed upon flipping the polarity of the electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we show that CrS bilayer with C-type antiferromagnetic exchange interaction exhibits a hidden layer-spin locking mechanism that enables the spin polarization of the transport current to be electrically manipulated via the layer degree of freedom. We demonstrate that sign-reversible spin polarization as high as 87% can be achieved at room temperature. This work presents the pioneering concept of layer-spintronics which synergizes altermagnetism and bilayer stacking to achieve efficient electrical control of spin.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Channels in Atmospheric Conditions: Propagation Characteristics and Security Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for higher wireless data rates, the interest in extending the carrier frequency of wireless links to the terahertz (THz) range has significantly increased. For long-distance outdoor wireless communications, THz channels may suffer substantial power loss and security issues due to atmospheric weather effects. It is crucial to assess the impact of weather on high-capacity data transmission to evaluate wireless system link budgets and performance accurately. In this article, we provide an insight into the propagation characteristics of THz channels under atmospheric conditions and the security aspects of THz communication systems in future applications. We conduct a comprehensive survey of our recent research and experimental findings on THz channel transmission and physical layer security, synthesizing and categorizing the state-of-the-art research in this domain. Our analysis encompasses various atmospheric phenomena, including molecular absorption, scattering effects, and turbulence, elucidating their intricate interactions with THz waves and the resultant implications for channel modeling and system design. Furthermore, we investigate the unique security challenges posed by THz communications, examining potential vulnerabilities and proposing novel countermeasures to enhance the resilience of these high-frequency systems against eavesdropping and other security threats. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of such high-frequency wireless communications and provide insights into future research prospects for realizing the 6G vision, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to overcome the atmospheric hurdles and security concerns in THz communications.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Photon Blockade for Nonreciprocal Quantum Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>
