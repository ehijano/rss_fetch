      <title>Quantum molecular docking with quantum-inspired algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking (MD) is a crucial task in drug design, which predicts the position, orientation, and conformation of the ligand when bound to a target protein. It can be interpreted as a combinatorial optimization problem, where quantum annealing (QA) has shown promising advantage for solving combinatorial optimization. In this work, we propose a novel quantum molecular docking (QMD) approach based on QA-inspired algorithm. We construct two binary encoding methods to efficiently discretize the degrees of freedom with exponentially reduced number of bits and propose a smoothing filter to rescale the rugged objective function. We propose a new quantum-inspired algorithm, hopscotch simulated bifurcation (hSB), showing great advantage in optimizing over extremely rugged energy landscapes. This hSB can be applied to any formulation of objective function under binary variables. An adaptive local continuous search is also introduced for further optimization of the discretized solution from hSB. Concerning the stability of docking, we propose a perturbation detection method to help ranking the candidate poses. We demonstrate our approach on a typical dataset. QMD has shown advantages over the search-based Autodock Vina and the deep-learning DIFFDOCK in both re-docking and self-docking scenarios. These results indicate that quantum-inspired algorithms can be applied to solve practical problems in the drug discovery even before quantum hardware become mature.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) inspired mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector wavefunctions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector wavefunctions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW pseudopotential inspired, basis set method for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis for a hybrid basis for small molecules.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian model of fluctuating membrane and its scattering properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model is developed, to jointly analyze elastic and inelastic scattering data of fluctuating membranes within a single theoretical framework. The model builds on a non-homogeneously clipped time-dependent Gaussian random field. This specific approach provides one with general analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering function, for any number of sublayers in the membrane and arbitrary contrasts. The model is illustrated with the analysis of small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering as well as with neutron spin-echo data measured on unilamellar vesicles prepared from phospholipids extracted from porcine brain tissues. The parameters fitted on the entire dataset are the lengths of the chain and head of the molecules that make up the membrane, the amplitude and lateral sizes of the bending deformations, the thickness fluctuation, and a single parameter characterizing the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning Chemotherapy Drug Action via Universal Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is widely used to assess drug effects and toxicity before the drug goes to clinical trial. However, significant manual distillation of the literature is needed in order to construct a QSP model. Parameters may need to be fit, and simplifying assumptions of the model need to be made. In this work, we apply Universal Physics-Informed Neural Networks (UPINNs) to learn unknown components of various differential equations that model chemotherapy pharmacodynamics. We learn three commonly employed chemotherapeutic drug actions (log-kill, Norton-Simon, and E_max) from synthetic data. Then, we use the UPINN method to fit the parameters for several synthetic datasets simultaneously. Finally, we learn the net proliferation rate in a model of doxorubicin (a chemotherapeutic) pharmacodynamics. As these are only toy examples, we highlight the usefulness of UPINNs in learning unknown terms in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic models.</description>

      <title>Deuteration removes quantum dipolar defects from KDP crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural, dielectric, and thermodynamic properties of the hydrogen-bonded ferroelectric crystal potassium dihydrogen phosphate ($\mathbf{KH_2PO_4}$), KDP for short, differ significantly from those of DKDP ($\mathbf{KD_2PO_4}$). It is well established that deuteration affects the interplay of hydrogen-bond switches and heavy ion displacements that underlie the emergence of macroscopic polarization, but a detailed microscopic model is missing. Here we show that all-atom path integral molecular dynamics simulations can predict the isotope effects, revealing the microscopic mechanism that differentiates KDP and DKDP. Proton tunneling in the hydrogen bonds generates phosphate configurations that do not contribute to the polarization. These dipolar defects are always present in KDP, but disappear at low temperatures in DKDP, which behaves more classically. Quantum disorder confers residual entropy to ferroelectric KDP, explaining its lower spontaneous polarization and transition entropy relative to DKDP. Tunneling should also contribute to the anomalous heat capacity observed in KDP near absolute zero. The prominent role of quantum fluctuations in KDP is related to the unusual strength of the hydrogen bonds in this system and should be equally important in the other crystals of the KDP family, which exhibit similar isotope effects.</description>

      <title>Gaussians for Electronic and Rovibrational Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assumptions underpinning the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation are broken for molecules interacting with attosecond laser pulses, which generate complicated coupled electronic-nuclear wavepackets that generally will have components of electronic and dissociation continua as well as bound-state contributions. The conceptually most straightforward way to overcome this challenge is to treat the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom on equal quantum-mechanical footing by not invoking the BO approximation at all. Explicitly correlated Gaussian (ECG) basis functions have proved successful for non-BO calculations of stationary molecular states and energies, reproducing rovibrational absorption spectra with very high accuracy. In this paper, we present a proof-of-principle study of the ability of fully flexible ECGs (FFECGs) to capture the intricate electronic and rovibrational dynamics generated by short, high-intensity laser pulses. By fitting linear combinations of FFECGs to accurate wave function histories obtained on a large real-space grid for a regularized 2D model of the hydrogen atom and for the 2D Morse potential we demonstrate that FFECGs provide a very compact description of laser-driven electronic and rovibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Machine learning activation function parameterization of the occupation numbers for natural orbital functionals based on electron pairing approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of natural orbital functional theory, having a convenient representation of the optimization function becomes critical for the computational performance of the calculation. Recognizing this, we propose an innovative parametrization of the occupation numbers that takes advantage of the electron-pairing approach used in Piris natural orbital functionals, through the adoption of the softmax function, a pivotal component in modern deep-learning models. Our approach not only ensures adherence to the N-representability of the first-order reduced density matrix (1RDM) but also significantly enhances the computational efficiency of 1RDM functional theory calculations. The effectiveness of this alternative parameterization approach was assessed using the W4-17-MR molecular set, which demonstrated faster and robust convergence compared to previous implementations.</description>

      <title>Platinum-based Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction simulated with a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source, holding the key to achieve low-carbon and sustainable mobility. However, its applications are still limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. Consequently, the development of novel catalysts and a profound understanding of the underlying reactions have become of paramount importance. The complex nature of the ORR potential energy landscape and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows to address these molecular systems. Here, we present a pioneering study that combines classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate the ORR on pure platinum and platinum/cobalt surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the involvement of strongly correlated species in the cobalt-containing catalyst, suggesting their potential as ideal candidates for showcasing quantum advantage in future applications.</description>

      <title>doped: Python toolkit for robust and repeatable charged defect supercell calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects are a universal feature of crystalline solids, dictating the key properties and performance of many functional materials. Given their crucial importance yet inherent difficulty in measuring experimentally, computational methods (such as DFT and ML/classical force-fields) are widely used to predict defect behaviour at the atomic level and the resultant impact on macroscopic properties. Here we report doped, a Python package for the generation, pre-/post-processing, and analysis of defect supercell calculations. doped has been built to implement the defect simulation workflow in an efficient and user-friendly -- yet powerful and fully-flexible -- manner, with the goal of providing a robust general-purpose platform for conducting reproducible calculations of solid-state defect properties.</description>

      <title>Leap: molecular synthesisability scoring with intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing whether a molecule can be synthesised is a primary task in drug discovery. It enables computational chemists to filter for viable compounds or bias molecular generative models. The notion of synthesisability is dynamic as it evolves depending on the availability of key compounds. A common approach in drug discovery involves exploring the chemical space surrounding synthetically-accessible intermediates. This strategy improves the synthesisability of the derived molecules due to the availability of key intermediates. Existing synthesisability scoring methods such as SAScore, SCScore and RAScore, cannot condition on intermediates dynamically. Our approach, Leap, is a GPT-2 model trained on the depth, or longest linear path, of predicted synthesis routes that allows information on the availability of key intermediates to be included at inference time. We show that Leap surpasses all other scoring methods by at least 5% on AUC score when identifying synthesisable molecules, and can successfully adapt predicted scores when presented with a relevant intermediate compound.</description>

      <title>Multi-radius Soler-Williams Augmented Plane Waves (SAPWMR), Multi-Radius Soler-Williams Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (SLAPWMR) and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structures (Density Functional Theory (DFT)) calculations. This basis set extends Soler Williams Linearized Augmented Plane Wave (SLAPW) basis sets by allowing variable Muffin Tin (MT) sphere radii for the different angular momentum channels and for different magnitude wave vectors of the augmented plane waves. With the correct choice of MT radius, this allows us to match additional derivatives of the wave function at the MT radius without having to resort to additional higher derivative terms as part of the wave function expansion inside the MT sphere. This should lead to low wave vector basis set and low linearization energy errors, arguably as good as APW basis set size and LAPW basis linearization errors. We call these basis sets SAPWMR and SLAPWMR depending on the number of derivative like wave functions kept inside the MT radii. Similarly local orbital (LO and lo basis wave functions depending on the number of derivative terms in the MT radius) are suggested with a variable radius. that reduces the number of derivative like terms needed to make them continuous or continuously differentiable. As such semi-core states can also be well handled by our methods. Furthermore in the appendix Full Potential Hamiltonian calculations (FLAPW) are extended to FSLAPWMR full potential calculations for Hamiltonian matrix elements. In the Appendix we introduce some further ideas to improve the speed of DFT calculations which are relevant to the basis sets presented here and to other basis sets such as the LAPW basis set.</description>
