      <title>Graph-based Interaction Augmentation Network for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inevitable modality imperfection in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). While existing methods tailor reconstruction or joint representation learning strategies to restore missing semantics, they often overlook complex dependencies within and across modalities. Consequently, they fail to fully leverage available modalities to capture complementary semantics. To this end, this paper proposes a novel graph-based framework to exploit both intra- and inter-modality interactions, enabling imperfect samples to derive missing semantics from complementary parts for robust MSA. Specifically, we first devise a learnable hypergraph to model intra-modality temporal dependencies to exploit contextual information within each modality. Then, a directed graph is employed to explore inter-modality correlations based on attention mechanism, capturing complementary information across different modalities. Finally, the knowledge from perfect samples is integrated to supervise our interaction processes, guiding the model toward learning reliable and robust joint representations. Extensive experiments on MOSI and MOSEI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>DRKF: Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However, inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/PANPANKK/DRKF.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.</description>

      <title>Conquering High Packet-Loss Erasure: MoE Swin Transformer-Based Video Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding robustly transmits diverse data modalities but faces challenges in mitigating semantic information loss due to packet drops in packet-based systems. Under current protocols, packets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing erroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a packet-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication (MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by MSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To investigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the packetization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by packet loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using un-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level interleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet drops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is adopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize redundancy. The model is lightweighted for practical deployment. Extensive simulations and comparisons demonstrate strong performance, achieving an MS-SSIM greater than 0.6 and a PSNR exceeding 20 dB at a 90% packet loss rate.</description>

      <title>CM$^3$: Calibrating Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment and uniformity are fundamental principles within the domain of contrastive learning. In recommender systems, prior work has established that optimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the objectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw together the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity mandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit hypersphere. This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within the context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among extant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our hypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment through a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with similar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within the hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity between items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution, thereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities within the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship between this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity function. Moreover, to enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce a Spherical B\'ezier method designed to integrate an arbitrary number of modalities while ensuring that the resulting fused features are constrained to the same hyperspherical manifold. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach over competing baselines. We also shown that the proposed methods can achieve up to a 5.4% increase in NDCG@20 performance via the integration of MLLM-extracted features.

      <title>Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Object-aware Representative Point Selection in Point Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2) Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.</description>

      <title>GaussianCross: Cross-modal Self-supervised 3D Representation Learning via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance, the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency, achieving superior performance through linear probing (&lt;0.1% parameters) and limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are publicly available at \href{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}.</description>

      <title>Learning Partially-Decorrelated Common Spaces for Ad-hoc Video Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces, yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations: feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss. Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multimedia services, video streaming has become increasingly prevalent, demanding innovative solutions to enhance user experience and system efficiency. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates user digital twins-a dynamic digital representation of a user's preferences and behaviors-with traditional video streaming systems. We explore the potential of this integration to dynamically adjust video preferences and optimize transcoding processes according to real-time data. The methodology leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to continuously update the user's digital twin, which in turn informs the transcoding service to adapt video parameters for optimal quality and minimal buffering. Experimental results show that our approach not only improves the personalization of content delivery but also significantly enhances the overall efficiency of video streaming services by reducing bandwidth usage and improving video playback quality. The implications of such advancements suggest a shift towards more adaptive, user-centric multimedia services, potentially transforming how video content is consumed and delivered.</description>

      <title>CLIP Brings Better Features to Visual Aesthetics Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA) is a challenging task due to its subjective nature and expensive manual annotations. Recent large-scale vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have shown their promising representation capability for various downstream tasks. However, the application of CLIP to resource-constrained and low-data IAA tasks remains limited. While few attempts to leverage CLIP in IAA have mainly focused on carefully designed prompts, we extend beyond this by allowing models from different domains and with different model sizes to acquire knowledge from CLIP. To achieve this, we propose a unified and flexible two-phase CLIP-based Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) paradigm, aiming to learn a lightweight IAA model while leveraging CLIP's strong generalization capability. Specifically, CSKD employs a feature alignment strategy to facilitate the distillation of heterogeneous CLIP teacher and IAA student models, effectively transferring valuable features from pre-trained visual representations to two lightweight IAA models, respectively. To efficiently adapt to downstream IAA tasks in a low-data regime, the two strong visual aesthetics learners then conduct distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge collaboratively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used IAA benchmarks. Furthermore, analysis of attention distance and entropy before and after feature alignment shows the effective transfer of CLIP's feature representation to IAA models, which not only provides valuable guidance for the model initialization of IAA but also enhances the aesthetic feature representation of IAA models. Code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music classification, a cornerstone of music information retrieval, supports a wide array of applications. To address the lack of comprehensive datasets and effective methods for sub-genre classification in mainstage dance music, we introduce a novel benchmark featuring a new dataset and baseline. Our dataset expands the scope of sub-genres to reflect the diversity of recent mainstage live sets performed by leading DJs at global music festivals, capturing the vibrant and rapidly evolving electronic dance music (EDM) scene that engages millions of fans worldwide. We employ a continuous soft labeling approach to accommodate tracks blending multiple sub-genres, preserving their inherent complexity. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, while our specialized baseline models achieve high accuracy. This benchmark supports applications such as music recommendation, DJ set curation, and interactive multimedia systems, with video demos provided. Our code and data are all open-sourced at https://github.com/Gariscat/housex-v2.git.</description>

      <title>More than Memes: A Multimodal Topic Modeling Approach to Conspiracy Theories on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. However, existing research often neglects visual content beyond memes, and in addition lacks methods to compare topic models across modalities. Our study addresses these gaps by applying multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. We use BERTopic with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data in a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories. Through this dataset, we provide insights into unimodal and multimodal topic models by analyzing symmetry and intersections of topics across modalities. We demonstrate the variety of textual and visual content shared in the channels discovered through the topic modeling, and propose a conceptual framework for the analysis of textual and visual discursive strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories. We apply the framework in a case study of the topic group Israel Gaza.</description>

      <title>D-Judge: How Far Are We? Evaluating the Discrepancies Between AI-synthesized Images and Natural Images through Multimodal Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), a central challenge is distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural images. Despite the impressive capabilities of advanced AI generative models in producing visually compelling content, significant discrepancies remain when compared to natural images. To systematically investigate and quantify these differences, we construct a large-scale multimodal dataset named DANI, comprising 5,000 natural images and over 440,000 AI-generated image (AIGI) samples produced by nine representative models using both unimodal and multimodal prompts, including Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text and Image-to-Image (TI2I). We then introduce D-Judge, a benchmark designed to answer the critical question: how far are AI-generated images from truly realistic images? Our fine-grained evaluation framework assesses DANI across five key dimensions: naive visual quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Extensive experiments reveal substantial discrepancies across these dimensions, highlighting the importance of aligning quantitative metrics with human judgment to achieve a comprehensive understanding of AI-generated image quality. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/ryliu68/DJudge and https://huggingface.co/datasets/Renyang/DANI.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prototype Knowledge Transfer for Federated Learning with Mixed Modalities and Heterogeneous Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) with mixed modalities enables unimodal and multimodal clients to collaboratively train models while ensuring clients' privacy. As a representative sample of local data, prototypes offer an approach with low resource consumption and no reliance on prior knowledge for MFL with mixed modalities. However, existing prototype-based MFL methods assume unified labels across clients and identical tasks per client, which is impractical in MFL with mixed modalities. In this work, we propose an Adaptive prototype-based Multimodal Federated Learning (AproMFL) framework for mixed modalities to address the aforementioned issues. Our AproMFL transfers knowledge through adaptively-constructed prototypes without unified labels. Clients adaptively select prototype construction methods in line with labels; server converts client prototypes into unified multimodal prototypes and cluster them to form global prototypes. To address model aggregation issues in task heterogeneity, we develop a client relationship graph-based scheme to dynamically adjust aggregation weights. Furthermore, we propose a global prototype knowledge transfer loss and a global model knowledge transfer loss to enable the transfer of global knowledge to local knowledge. Experimental results show that AproMFL outperforms four baselines on three highly heterogeneous datasets ($\alpha=0.1$) and two heterogeneous tasks, with the optimal results in accuracy and recall being 0.42%~6.09% and 1.6%~3.89% higher than those of FedIoT (FedAvg-based MFL), respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards Temporal-Aware Multi-Modal Retrieval Augmented Generation in Finance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finance decision-making often relies on in-depth data analysis across various data sources, including financial tables, news articles, stock prices, etc. In this work, we introduce FinTMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal-aware multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in finance. Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different financial analysis tasks designed by domain experts, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</description>

      <title>VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.</description>

      <title>Anti-Inpainting: A Proactive Defense Approach against Malicious Diffusion-based Inpainters under Unknown Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of diffusion-based malicious image manipulation, existing proactive defense methods struggle to safeguard images against tampering under unknown conditions. To address this, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense approach that achieves protection comprising three novel modules. First, we introduce a multi-level deep feature extractor to obtain intricate features from the diffusion denoising process, enhancing protective effectiveness. Second, we design a multi-scale, semantic-preserving data augmentation technique to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions. Finally, we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to bolster protection against manipulations guided by diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments on InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ demonstrate that Anti-Inpainting effectively defends against diffusion-based inpainters under unknown conditions. Additionally, our approach demonstrates robustness against various image purification methods and transferability across different diffusion model versions.</description>

      <title>RAISE: Realness Assessment for Image Synthesis and Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive. However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores, introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of perceptual realness assessment.</description>

      <title>CountingFruit: Language-Guided 3D Fruit Counting with Semantic Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate 3D fruit counting in orchards is challenging due to heavy occlusion, semantic ambiguity between fruits and surrounding structures, and the high computational cost of volumetric reconstruction. Existing pipelines often rely on multi-view 2D segmentation and dense volumetric sampling, which lead to accumulated fusion errors and slow inference. We introduce FruitLangGS, a language-guided 3D fruit counting framework that reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization, enabling scalable 3D representation. During inference, compressed CLIP-aligned semantic vectors embedded in each Gaussian are filtered via a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism, retrieving Gaussians relevant to target prompts while suppressing common distractors (e.g., foliage), without requiring retraining or image-space masks. The selected Gaussians are then sampled into dense point clouds and clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, remaining robust under severe occlusion and viewpoint variation. Experiments on nine different orchard-scale datasets demonstrate that FruitLangGS consistently outperforms existing pipelines in instance counting recall, avoiding multi-view segmentation fusion errors and achieving up to 99.2\% recall on Fuji-SfM orchard dataset. Ablation studies further confirm that language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering are essential for suppressing distractors and improving counting accuracy under heavy occlusion. Beyond fruit counting, the same framework enables prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, highlighting the potential of language-guided 3D perception for scalable agricultural scene understanding.</description>

      <title>VRBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Step Reasoning in Long Narrative Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity. It comprises 960 long videos (with an average duration of 1.6 hours), along with 8,243 human-labeled multi-step question-answering pairs and 25,106 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 19 VLMs on VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that advance the field of multi-step reasoning.</description>

      <title>ActAlign: Zero-Shot Fine-Grained Video Classification via Language-Guided Sequence Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot video classification for extremely fine-grained actions (e.g., Windmill Dunk in basketball), where no video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen classes. While image-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition, they lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose ActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video classification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization strength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language model (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions across multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer parameters. Our approach is model-agnostic and domain-general, demonstrating that structured language priors combined with classical alignment methods can unlock the open-set recognition potential of image-language models for fine-grained video understanding.</description>

      <title>MuteSwap: Visual-informed Silent Video Identity Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Semantic Parsing for the Interpretation of Tombstone Inscriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation, and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes, and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.</description>

      <title>Catching Dark Signals in Algorithms: Unveiling Audiovisual and Thematic Markers of Unsafe Content Recommended for Children and Teenagers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of short form video platforms, combined with the ineffectiveness of age verification mechanisms, raises concerns about the potential harms facing children and teenagers in an algorithm-moderated online environment. We conducted multimodal feature analysis and thematic topic modeling of 4,492 short videos recommended to children and teenagers on Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, collected as a part of an algorithm auditing experiment. This feature-level and content-level analysis revealed that unsafe (i.e., problematic, mentally distressing) short videos (a) possess darker visual features and (b) contain explicitly harmful content and implicit harm from anxiety-inducing ordinary content. We introduce a useful framework of online harm (i.e., explicit, implicit, unintended), providing a unique lens for understanding the dynamic, multifaceted online risks facing children and teenagers. The findings highlight the importance of protecting younger audiences in critical developmental stages from both explicit and implicit risks on social media, calling for nuanced content moderation, age verification, and platform regulation.</description>

      <title>LAVA: Language Driven Scalable and Versatile Traffic Video Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yuyanrui/LAVA.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Unspoken: Exploring "365" Aspects of Multimodal Interview Performance Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22676</link>

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates' suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores ``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three} modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and \textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview performance assessment.

      <title>AudioGen-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Video-Synchronized Audio, Speech, and Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.</description>

      <title>Is It Really You? Exploring Biometric Verification Scenarios in Photorealistic Talking-Head Avatar Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's avatar, preserving his appearance and voice, making it nearly impossible to detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.</description>
