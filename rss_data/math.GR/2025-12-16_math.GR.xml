      <title>Irreducible groups and ergodicity in the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is a real semi-simple Lie group, and $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup of $G$ containing a subgroup $\Sigma$ acting ergodically (in a strong sense) on the Furstenberg boundary of $G$, then $\Gamma$ is not isomorphic to a free product of $\Sigma$ with $\Z$. Moreover, if $\Sigma$ has algebraic entries, then $\Gamma$ has algebraic entries as well. As a consequence, we show that if all irreducible discrete subgroups of $\SL_2(\R) \times \SL_2(\R)$ act ergodically on $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1 $, such groups cannot be free groups (or even Gromov hyperbolic). In the appendix, we discuss a connection between the existence of discrete irreducible groups and diophantine properties of Lie groups.</description>

      <title>An explicit exotic representation of a rank-one simple Lie group via convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [DP12], Delzant and Py showed that there exist continuous irreducible isometric actions of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ on the infinite-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^\infty$. Such continuous irreducible actions do not exist on the hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^n$ when $n&gt;2$ and their associated embeddings $\mathbb{H}^2 \to \mathbb{H}^\infty$ given by the orbit maps were later called exotic by Monod and Py in [MP14]. In this article, we produce a continuous and irreducible representation of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})\to \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^\infty)$ using the hyperbolic model for convex bodies introduced in [DF22]. This yields a convex cocompact $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-action on the infinite-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^\infty$, of which the compact quotient over the minimal $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-invariant convex set is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional oriented Banach--Mazur compactum. Moreover, we study the geometry of one of its orbit maps and compute the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of this representation.</description>

      <title>On automorphism groups of power semigroups over numerical semigroups or over numerical monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ be the additive monoid of non-negative integers with $0$ the zero-element. A numerical semigroup (resp., monoid) is a subsemigroup (resp., submonoid) $S$ of $(\mathbb{N }, +)$ such that $\mathbb{N} \setminus S$ is a finite set. Denote by $\mathcal{P} (S)$ the semigroup consisting of all finite nonempty subsets of $S$ and endowed with the setwise binary addition $$X+Y=\{x+y:x\in X, y\in Y\},$$ which is called the power semigroup of $S$. When $S$ is a numerical monoid with $0$, by $\mathcal{P}_{ 0}(S)$ we denote the monoid consisting of all finite nonempty subsets of $S$ containing $0$, which is the reduced power monoid of $S$ with the singleton $\{0\}$ as zero-element.
  For a finite subset $X$ of $\mathbb{N}$, we denote by $\alpha(X)$ and $\beta(X)$ the minimum member and the maximum member in $X$. Recently, Tringali and Yan (\cite{tri2}, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 209(2025)) proved that the only non-trivial automorphism of $\mathcal{P}_{0}(\mathbb{N})$ is the involution $X \mapsto \beta(X) - X$, and they posed a conjecture: {\it The automorphism group of the reduced power monoid $\mathcal{P}_{0}(S)$ of a numerical monoid $S$ properly contained in $\mathbb{N}$ must be the identity}. In this article, the automorphism group of the power semigroup $\mathcal{P}(S)$ of an arbitrary numerical semigroup $S$ is determined. More precisely, if $S= [\![k,\infty)$, with $k\in \mathbb{N}$, is an (discrete) interval, then the only non-trivial automorphism of $\mathcal{P}(S)$ is the involution $ X \mapsto \beta(X) -X+\alpha(X)$, otherwise, $\mathcal{P}(S)$ has only the identity automorphism. Thus the conjecture posed by Tringali and Yan \cite{tri2} is proved to be true for any power monoid $\mathcal{P}(S)$ with $S$ an arbitrary numerical monoid properly contained in $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>The finitely generated intersection property in fundamental groups of graphs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is said to satisfy the finitely generated intersection property (f.g.i.p.) if the intersection of any two finitely generated subgroups of $G$ is again finitely generated. The aim of this article is to understand when the fundamental group of a graph of groups has the f.g.i.p. Our main results are general criteria for the f.g.i.p. in graphs of groups which depend on properties of the vertex groups, properties of certain double cosets of the edge groups and the structure of the underlying graph. For acylindrical graphs of groups, we also obtain criteria for the strong f.g.i.p. (s.f.g.i.p.). Our results generalise classical results due to Burns and Cohen on the f.g.i.p. for amalgamated free products and HNN extensions. As a concrete application, we show that a graph of locally quasi-convex hyperbolic groups with virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ edge groups (for instance, a generalised Baumslag--Solitar group) has the f.g.i.p. if and only if it does not contain $F_2\times\mathbb{Z}$ as a subgroup. In addition, we show that this condition is decidable. The main tools we use are the explicit constructions of pullbacks of immersions into a graph of group, obtained by the authors in a previous paper, and a technical condition on coset interactions, introduced in this paper.</description>

      <title>Deformations of crossed homomorphisms on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study deformations of crossed homomorphisms on Lie groups by means of the cohomology which controls them. Using the Moser type argument, we obtain several rigidity results of crossed homomorphisms on Lie groups. We further investigate the relationship between the cohomology of crossed homomorphisms on Lie groups and that on Lie algebras. Finally, we characterize the rigidity properties of all crossed homomorphisms with respect to the conjugation action on the connected and simply connected two-dimensional Lie group.</description>

      <title>On the permanence properties of residually exact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete group $\Gamma$ is called exact if the reduced group C*-algebra ${C_{\lambda}}^{*}(\Gamma)$ is exact as C*-algebras, and a discrete group $\Lambda$ is called residually exact if every nonunital element $g \in \Lambda$ admits a surjective group homomorphism from $\Lambda$ to some exact group $\Gamma$ which maps $g$ to a nonunital element of $\Gamma$.
  We prove the class of residually exact groups is closed under taking Green's graph products [1], double amalgamed products and special HNN extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,+,d)$ be an Abelian metric group and $A\subset X$. We investigate the spectre of a set $A$, defined as the set of all elements $z\in X$ such that for every $x\in A$ either $x+z \in A$ or $x-z \in A$. We consider the corresponding to this notion operator $S$ acting on the hyperspace of compact sets and examine its properties. Furthermore, we study the families of achievement sets and sets of $P$-sums in this hyperspace, as well as prove some properties of achievement sets in the plane.</description>

Abstract: We consider the existence problem of lift F of a map f between Carnot group with different smoothness, where we use central extension to define lifting. Our main result is the existence of the contact lifts of Lipschitz and Sobolev maps and the rigidity result for the contact lift of quasiconformal maps: a quasiconformal map admits a contact lift then it is bi-Lipschitz. We also show a necessary criterion for the extension of {\gamma}-Holder lift when {\gamma} &gt; n+1/n for step-n Carnot group.</description>

      <title>Dense Conjugacy Classes and Stability of Locally Finite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping class groups of locally finite graphs are the analogue of those of infinite-type surfaces, and serve as a ``big'' version of $\text{Out}(F_n)$. In this paper, we investigate which of these mapping class groups have a dense conjugacy class. We obtain a complete classification for self-similar locally finite graphs, and show that a large class of mapping class groups do not have a dense conjugacy class. One of the main tools we develop is flux homomorphisms, which we define for a broad class of locally finite graphs. Along the way, we develop a combinatorial notion for locally finite graphs, and we use it to provide a simple criterion for determining whether a locally finite graph is stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the relation of topological isomorphism on procountable groups is not classifiable by countable structures, in the sense of descriptive set theory. In fact, the equivalence relation $\ell_\infty$ that expresses that two sequences of reals have bounded difference is Borel reducible to it. This marks progress on an open problem of [15], to determine the exact complexity of isomorphism among all non-archimedean Polish groups.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of non-Archimedean groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Aut(G)$ denote the group of (bi-)continuous automorphisms %and $\Out(G)$ the outer automorphism group of a non-Archimedean Polish group~$G$. We show that for any such $G$ with an invariant countable basis of open subgroups, the group $\Aut(G)$ carries a unique Polish topology that makes its natural action on $G$ continuous. Furthermore, for any class of groups allowing a Borel assignment of such bases, there is a functorial duality to a class of countable groupoids with a meet operation, extending
  work of the authors with Tent (Coarse groups, and the isomorphism problem for oligomorphic
  groups, Journal of Mathematical Logic, 2021). This provides an alternative description of the topology of $\Aut(G)$. The results hold for instance for the class of locally Roelcke precompact non-Archimedean groups, which contains most classes studied previously. We further provide a model-theoretic proof that the outer automorphism group $\Out(G)$ of an oligomorphic group $G$ is locally compact, a result due to Paolini and the first author (arXiv:2410.02248).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>

      <title>Group-averaged Markov chains II: tuning of group action in finite state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study group-averaged Markov chains obtained by augmenting a $\pi$-stationary transition kernel $P$ with a group action on the state space via orbit kernels. Given a group $\mathcal{G}$ with orbits $(\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$, we analyse three canonical orbit kernels: namely the Gibbs $(G)$, Metropolis-Hastings $(M)$, and Barker $(B)$ kernels, as well as their multiplicative sandwiches $QPQ$ and the additive mixtures $\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$ where $Q\in\{G,M,B\}$. We show that $M^t, B^t \to G$ blockwise as $t \to \infty$ under suitable conditions, that the projection chains induced by $(\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$ coincide for $GPG$ and $P$, and that orbit averaging never deteriorates the absolute spectral gap or asymptotic variance when $P$ is reversible. We give a direct and simple proof of Pythagorean identity under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, showing that $GPG$ arises naturally as an information projection of $P$ onto the set of $G$-invariant transition matrices. For a given $P$, we characterise the optimal choice of $G$ with a fixed number of orbits that minimises the one-step KL divergence to stationarity. Analogously, for a given $G$, we characterise the optimal choice of $P$ and give sufficient conditions under which $GPG = \Pi$. We further show that alternating projections over multiple group actions converge at a rate governed by the singular values of an overlap matrix, and that in structured cases, this yields exact sampling where the number of group actions grows logarithmically with the size of the state space. Based on the theory, we propose two heuristics to tune $G$ in practice. We also illustrate the results on discrete uniform and multimodal examples, including the Curie-Weiss model where $GPG$ achieves polynomial (in inverse temperature and dimension) mixing while Glauber dynamics remains exponentially slow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider epimorphisms and several variant notions -- split, effective, regular, strong, and extremal -- and determine which of these coincide in the metric coarse and coarsely Lipschitz categories. In particular, we characterise extremal epis in the coarsely Lipschitz category via a relative maximality condition on the codomain metric; this can be viewed as a morphism-relative analogue of Rosendal's maximal metrics for topological groups.</description>

Abstract: Let $N$ be normal subgroup of a finite group $G$, $p$ be a prime, $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and $\theta$ be a $P$-invariant irreducible character of $N$. Suppose that $G/N$ is a $p$-solvable group. In this note we show that, whenever a finite group $A$ acts on $G$ stabilizing $P$, there exists an $A$-equivariant McKay bijection between irreducible characters lying over $\theta$ of degree prime to $p$ of $G$ and $\textbf{N}_G(P)$. This is a consequence of a recent result of D. Rossi. Our approach here is independent from Rossi's and follows the original idea of the proof of the McKay conjecture for $p$-solvable groups. In particular, we rely on the so-called Okuyama-Wajima argument to deal with characters above Glauberman correspondents. For this purpose, we generalize a classical result of P. X. Gallagher on the number of irreducible characters of $G$ lying over $\theta$.</description>

      <title>On operator Connes-amenability of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Runde and Spronk showed in 2004 that there are non-amenable groups $G$, including $\mathbb F_2$, where $B(G)$ is operator Connes-amenable. This result was surprising since the measure algebra $M(G)$ is Connes-amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable, which might lead one to guess that $B(G)$ should be operator Connes-amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable. This leads to the question: for which groups $G$ is $B(G)$ operator Connes-amenable? We make progress on this problem by giving the first examples of groups where $B(G)$ is known to not be operator Connes-amenable. More specifically, we show that $B(G)$ is not operator Connes-amenable when $G$ is a non-compact locally compact group with property (T) and finite almost periodic compactification, or when $G$ is a discrete group without the factorization property. This refutes the suggestion of Dales that $B(G)$ might be operator Connes-amenable for every locally compact group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish homological stability for automorphisms of symmetric bilinear forms over a class of principal ideal domains that includes all fields, the integers, the Gaussian integers, and the Eisenstein integers. In conjunction with Grothendieck-Witt theoretic calculations, this determines a large part of the stable cohomology of the odd orthogonal groups $O_{\langle g,g \rangle}(\mathbb Z)$ in low degrees.</description>

      <title>On the centralizers of endomorphisms of the projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a dominant endomorphism of the projective line, which is not conjugate to a power map $z\mapsto z^{\pm d}$. We consider the centralizers of the iterates of $f$, $C(f^{n}):=\{\textrm{dominant}\;g:\mathbb{P}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{1}\;|\; g\circ f^{n}=f^{n}\circ g\}$, $n\geq1$, and prove that their union is equal to $C(f^{N})$ for some $N\geq1$. This solves a conjecture of F. Pakovich. As an application, we obtain a Tits alternative for cancellative semigroups of endomorphisms of the projective line, without an assumption of finite generation, extending the results of J.P. Bell, K. Huang, W. Peng and T.J. Tucker.</description>

      <title>Divergence, thickness and hypergraph index for general Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study divergence and thickness for general Coxeter groups $W$. We first characterise linear divergence, and show that if $W$ has superlinear divergence then its divergence is at least quadratic. We then formulate a computable combinatorial invariant, hypergraph index, for arbitrary Coxeter systems $(W,S)$. This generalises Levcovitz's definition for the right-angled case. We prove that if $(W,S)$ has finite hypergraph index $h$, then $W$ is (strongly algebraically) thick of order at most $h$, hence has divergence bounded above by a polynomial of degree $h+1$. We conjecture that these upper bounds on the order of thickness and divergence are in fact equalities, and we prove our conjecture for certain families of Coxeter groups. These families are obtained by a new construction which, given any right-angled Coxeter group, produces infinitely many examples of non-right-angled Coxeter systems with the same hypergraph index. Finally, we give an upper bound on the hypergraph index of any Coxeter system $(W,S)$, and hence on the divergence of $W$, in terms of, unexpectedly, the topology of its associated Dynkin diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that wreath products of groups have linear divergence, and we generalise the argument to permutational wreath products. We also prove that Houghton groups $\mathcal{H}_m$ with $m\geq 2$ and Baumslag-Solitar groups have linear divergence. We explain how to generalise the argument for wreath products so that it holds for halo products of groups whose halo is large-scale commutative. Finally, we show that wreath products of graphs and Diestel-Leader graphs have linear divergence. The argument for Diestel-Leader graphs is further generalised to horocyclic products of proper, geodesically complete, Busemann $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces that are uniformly not a quasi-line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08248v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a group $G$ admits a virtually special action on a CAT(0) cube complex, then any product of convex-cocompact subgroups of $G$ is separable. Previously, this was only known for products of three subgroups, or in the case where $G$ is hyperbolic, or in some other more technical cases with additional assumptions on the subgroups (plus these previous results assume that the action of $G$ is cocompact). We also provide an application to the action of a virtually special cubulated group on its contact graph (and to some other actions of cubulated groups on graphs).</description>

      <title>Property (QT) of relatively hierarchically hyperbolic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the projection complex machinery, Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara, Hagen-Petyt and Han-Nguyen-Yang prove that several classes of nonpositively-curved groups admit equivariant quasi-isometric embeddings into finite products of quasi-trees, i.e. having property (QT). In this paper, we unify and generalize the above results by establishing a sufficient condition for relatively hierarchically hyperbolic groups to have property (QT).
  As applications, we show that a group has property (QT) if it is residually finite and belongs to one of the following classes of groups: admissible groups, hyperbolic--$2$--decomposable groups with no distorted elements, Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type. We also introduce a slightly stronger version of property (QT), called property (QT'), and show the invariance of property (QT') under graph products.</description>

      <title>The Pseudocentre of a Group (with an appendix by Anthony Genevois)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1973, Jim Wiegold introduced the concept of pseudocentre P(G) of a group G as the intersection of the normal closures of the centralizers of its elements. He proved that the pseudocentre of a non-trivial finite group is always non-trivial, giving a new variable on which one can use induction in finite group theory. In the same paper, Wiegold states that no obvious relations seem to hold between the pseudocentre and the canonical characteristic subgroups of a group.
  The aim of this work is to show that the pseudocentre is indeed much more involved in the structure of an arbitrary group then anyone could have expected. For example, we prove that a soluble group coincides with its pseudocentre if and only if it is abelian, and that the structure of the commutator subgroup strongly influences the structure of the pseudocentre. And this is not the end of the story. In fact, the behaviour of the pseudocentre in arbitrary (possibly infinite) groups can be extremely wild: sometimes it is very difficult even to understand whether the pseudocentre is trivial or not. This wilderness is exampled by some of our main results (see the introduction for a complete list):
  1) There exists a polycyclic group of Hirsch length 3 in which the pseudocentre is trivial. 2) The pseudocentre of the group of unitriangular matrices over any field is the largest term of the upper central series that is abelian. 3) Free products have a trivial pseudocentre, but there exist amalgamated free products of non-trivial groups coinciding with their pseudocentre. 4) Weakly regular branch groups have a trivial pseudocentre. 5) The pseudocentre of the Thompson group is the derived subgroup. 6) Wreath products can have a totally arbitrary pseudocentre.</description>

      <title>Whitehead's problem and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09122v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the better-known independence results in general mathematics is Shelah's solution to Whitehead's problem of whether $\mathrm{Ext}^1(A,\mathbb{Z})=0$ implies that an abelian group $A$ is free. The point of departure for the present work is Clausen and Scholze's proof that, in contrast, one natural interpretation of Whitehead's problem within their recently-developed framework of condensed mathematics has an affirmative answer in $\mathsf{ZFC}$. We record two alternative proofs of this result, as well as several original variations on it, both for their intrinsic interest and as a springboard for a broader study of the relations between condensed mathematics and set theoretic forcing. We show more particularly how the condensation $\underline{X}$ of any locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ may be viewed as an organized presentation of the forcing names for the points of canonical interpretations of $X$ in all possible set-forcing extensions of the universe, and we argue our main result by way of this fact. We show also that when interpreted within the category of light condensed abelian groups, Whitehead's problem is again independent of the $\mathsf{ZFC}$ axioms. In fact we show that it is consistent that Whitehead's problem has a negative solution within the category of $\kappa$-condensed abelian groups for every uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, but that this scenario, in turn, is inconsistent with the existence of a strongly compact cardinal.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous actions on cones, joins, and $n$-universal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that locally countably-compact Hausdorff topological groups $\mathbb{G}$ act continuously on their iterated joins $E_n\mathbb{G}:=\mathbb{G}^{*(n+1)}$ (the total spaces of the Milnor-model $n$-universal $\mathbb{G}$-bundles) as well as the colimit-topologized unions $E\mathbb{G}=\varinjlim_n E_n\mathbb{G}$, and the converse holds under the assumption that $\mathbb{G}$ is first-countable. In the latter case other mutually equivalent conditions provide characterizations of local countable compactness: the fact that $\mathbb{G}$ acts continuously on its first self-join $E_1\mathbb{G}$, or on its cone $\mathcal{C}\mathbb{G}$, or the coincidence of the product and quotient topologies on $\mathbb{G}\times \mathcal{C}X$ for all spaces $X$ or, equivalently, for the discrete countably-infinite $X:=\aleph_0$. These can all be regarded as weakened versions of $\mathbb{G}$'s exponentiability, all to the effect that $\mathbb{G}\times -$ preserves certain colimit shapes in the category of topological spaces; the results thus extend the equivalence (under the separation assumption) between local compactness and exponentiability.</description>
