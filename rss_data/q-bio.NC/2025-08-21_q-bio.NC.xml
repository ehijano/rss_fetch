      <title>Goals and the Structure of Experience</title>

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning, posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation (descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal. Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse substrates.</description>

      <title>From Basic Affordances to Symbolic Thought: A Computational Phylogenesis of Biological Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought, but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding, to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous phase transition of feature detection in lateral predictive coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brain may adopt the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals, reducing the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we first consider the task of detecting one non-Gaussian signal by LPC from Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness, and implement this tradeoff by a thermodynamic free energy. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. There are at least three types of optimal LPC matrices, one type with very weak synaptic weights and $S \approx 0$, and two functional types either with low energy $E$ or with high entropy $S$ in which one single unit selectively responds to the non-Gaussian input feature. Energy--information tradeoff induce two discontinuous phase transitions between these three types of optimal LPC networks. We then extend the discussion to detecting and distinguishing between two non-Gaussian input features and observe similar discontinuous phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Flexible Tool Selection through Low-dimensional Attribute Alignment of Vision and Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Human evaluation studies validate our framework's alignment with human decision-making patterns, and generalization experiments demonstrate effective performance on novel tool categories. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, elongation, hand-relatedness) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.</description>
