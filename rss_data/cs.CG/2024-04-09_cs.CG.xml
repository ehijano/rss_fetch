      <title>Quantum Speedup for Some Geometric 3SUM-Hard Problems and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical 3SUM conjecture states that the class of 3SUM-hard problems does not admit a truly subquadratic $O(n^{2-\delta})$-time algorithm, where $\delta &gt;0$, in classical computing. The geometric 3SUM-hard problems have widely been studied in computational geometry and recently, these problems have been examined under the quantum computing model. For example, Ambainis and Larka [TQC'20] designed a quantum algorithm that can solve many geometric 3SUM-hard problems in $O(n^{1+o(1)})$-time, whereas Buhrman [ITCS'22] investigated lower bounds under quantum 3SUM conjecture that claims there does not exist any sublinear $O(n^{1-\delta})$-time quantum algorithm for the 3SUM problem. The main idea of Ambainis and Larka is to formulate a 3SUM-hard problem as a search problem, where one needs to find a point with a certain property over a set of regions determined by a line arrangement in the plane. The quantum speed-up then comes from the application of the well-known quantum search technique called Grover search over all regions.
  This paper further generalizes the technique of Ambainis and Larka for some 3SUM-hard problems when a solution may not necessarily correspond to a single point or the search regions do not immediately correspond to the subdivision determined by a line arrangement. Given a set of $n$ points and a positive number $q$, we design $O(n^{1+o(1)})$-time quantum algorithms to determine whether there exists a triangle among these points with an area at most $q$ or a unit disk that contains at least $q$ points. We also give an $O(n^{1+o(1)})$-time quantum algorithm to determine whether a given set of intervals can be translated so that it becomes contained in another set of given intervals and discuss further generalizations.</description>

      <title>Super Guarding and Dark Rays in Art Galleries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an Art Gallery variant where each point of a polygon must be seen by k guards, and guards cannot see through other guards. Surprisingly, even covering convex polygons under this variant is not straightforward. For example, covering every point in a triangle k=4 times (a 4-cover) requires 5 guards, and achieving a 10-cover requires 12 guards. Our main result is tight bounds on k-covering a convex polygon of n vertices, for all k and n. The proofs of both upper and lower bounds are nontrivial. We also obtain bounds for simple polygons, leaving tight bounds an open problem.</description>

      <title>Spanners in Planar Domains via Steiner Spanners and non-Steiner Tree Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spanners in planar domains, including polygonal domains, polyhedral terrain, and planar metrics. Previous work showed that for any constant $\epsilon\in (0,1)$, one could construct a $(2+\epsilon)$-spanner with $O(n\log(n))$ edges (SICOMP 2019), and there is a lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ edges for any $(2-\epsilon)$-spanner (SoCG 2015). The main open question is whether a linear number of edges suffices and the stretch can be reduced to $2$. We resolve this problem by showing that for stretch $2$, one needs $\Omega(n\log n)$ edges, and for stretch $2+\epsilon$ for any fixed $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, $O(n)$ edges are sufficient. Our lower bound is the first super-linear lower bound for stretch $2$.
  En route to achieve our result, we introduce the problem of constructing non-Steiner tree covers for metrics, which is a natural variant of the well-known Steiner point removal problem for trees (SODA 2001). Given a tree and a set of terminals in the tree, our goal is to construct a collection of a small number of dominating trees such that for every two points, at least one tree in the collection preserves their distance within a small stretch factor. Here, we identify an unexpected threshold phenomenon around $2$ where a sharp transition from $n$ trees to $\Theta(\log n)$ trees and then to $O(1)$ trees happens. Specifically, (i) for stretch $ 2-\epsilon$, one needs $\Omega(n)$ trees; (ii) for stretch $2$, $\Theta(\log n)$ tree is necessary and sufficient; and (iii) for stretch $2+\epsilon$, a constant number of trees suffice. Furthermore, our lower bound technique for the non-Steiner tree covers of stretch $2$ has further applications in proving lower bounds for two related constructions in tree metrics: reliable spanners and locality-sensitive orderings. Our lower bound for locality-sensitive orderings matches the best upper bound (STOC 2022).</description>

      <title>Walking Your Frog Fast in 4 LoC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two polygonal curves, there are many ways to define a notion of similarity between them. One popular measure is the Fr\'echet distance which has many desirable properties but is notoriously expensive to calculate, especially for non-trivial metrics. In 1994, Eiter and Mannila introduced the discrete Fr\'echet distance which is much easier to implement and approximates the continuous Fr\'echet distance with a quadratic runtime overhead. However, this algorithm relies on recursions and is not well suited for modern hardware. To that end, we introduce the Fast Fr\'echet Distance algorithm, a recursion-free algorithm that calculates the discrete Fr\'echet distance with a linear memory overhead and that can utilize modern hardware more effectively. We showcase an implementation with only four lines of code and present benchmarks of our algorithm running fast on modern CPUs and GPGPUs.</description>

      <title>Online Sorting and Translational Packing of Convex Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate several online packing problems in which convex polygons arrive one by one and have to be placed irrevocably into a container, while the aim is to minimize the used space. Among other variants, we consider strip packing and bin packing, where the container is the infinite horizontal strip $[0,\infty)\times [0,1]$ or a collection of $1 \times 1$ bins, respectively.
  We draw interesting connections to the following online sorting problem OnlineSorting$[\gamma,n]$: We receive a stream of real numbers $s_1,\ldots,s_n$, $s_i\in[0,1]$, one by one. Each real must be placed in an array $A$ with $\gamma n$ initially empty cells without knowing the subsequent reals. The goal is to minimize the sum of differences of consecutive reals in $A$. The offline optimum is to place the reals in sorted order so the cost is at most $1$. We show that for any $\Delta$-competitive online algorithm of OnlineSorting$[\gamma,n]$, it holds that $\gamma \Delta \in\Omega(\log n/\log \log n)$.
  We use this lower bound to prove the non-existence of competitive algorithms for various online translational packing problems of convex polygons, among them strip packing, bin packing and perimeter packing. This also implies that there exists no online algorithm that can pack all streams of pieces of diameter and total area at most $\delta$ into the unit square. These results are in contrast to the case when the pieces are restricted to rectangles, for which competitive algorithms are known. Likewise, the offline versions of packing convex polygons have constant factor approximation algorithms.
  As a complement, we also include algorithms for both online sorting and translation-only online strip packing with non-trivial competitive ratios. Our algorithm for strip packing relies on a new technique for recursively subdividing the strip into parallelograms of varying height, thickness and slope.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Symbol Visibility through Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In information visualization, the position of symbols often encodes associated data values. When visualizing data elements with both a numerical and a categorical dimension, positioning in the categorical axis admits some flexibility. This flexibility can be exploited to reduce symbol overlap, and thereby increase legibility. In this paper we initialize the algorithmic study of optimizing symbol legibility via a limited displacement of the symbols. Specifically, we consider unit square symbols that need to be placed at specified $y$-coordinates. We optimize the drawing order of the symbols as well as their $x$-displacement, constrained within a rectangular container, to maximize the minimum visible perimeter over all squares. If the container has width and height at most $2$, there is a point that stabs all squares. In this case, we prove that a staircase layout is arbitrarily close to optimality and can be computed in $O(n\log n)$ time. If the width is at most $2$, there is a vertical line that stabs all squares, and in this case, we give a 2-approximation algorithm that runs in $O(n\log n)$ time. As a minimum visible perimeter of $2$ is always trivially achievable, we measure this approximation with respect to the visible perimeter exceeding $2$. We show that, despite its simplicity, the algorithm gives asymptotically optimal results for certain instances.</description>

      <title>RF-ULM: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy Learned from Radio-Frequency Wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01545v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM), achieving high-resolution images relies on the precise localization of contrast agent particles across a series of beamformed frames. However, our study uncovers an enormous potential: The process of delay-and-sum beamforming leads to an irreversible reduction of Radio-Frequency (RF) channel data, while its implications for localization remain largely unexplored. The rich contextual information embedded within RF wavefronts, including their hyperbolic shape and phase, offers great promise for guiding Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in challenging localization scenarios. To fully exploit this data, we propose to directly localize scatterers in RF channel data. Our approach involves a custom super-resolution DNN using learned feature channel shuffling, non-maximum suppression, and a semi-global convolutional block for reliable and accurate wavefront localization. Additionally, we introduce a geometric point transformation that facilitates seamless mapping to the B-mode coordinate space. To understand the impact of beamforming on ULM, we validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting an extensive comparison with State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) techniques. We present the inaugural in vivo results from a wavefront-localizing DNN, highlighting its real-world practicality. Our findings show that RF-ULM bridges the domain shift between synthetic and real datasets, offering a considerable advantage in terms of precision and complexity. To enable the broader research community to benefit from our findings, our code and the associated SOTA methods are made available at https://github.com/hahnec/rf-ulm.</description>

Abstract: The Analyst's Traveling Salesman Problem asks for conditions under which a (finite or infinite) subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is contained on a curve of finite length. We show that for finite sets, the algorithm constructed by Schul (2007)and Badger-Naples-Vellis (2019) that solves the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Problem has polynomial time complexity and we determine the sharp exponent.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Rank Invariant: M\"obius invertibility, Discriminating Power, and Connection to Other Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike one-parameter persistent homology, the absence of a canonical method for quantifying `persistence' in multiparameter persistent homology remains a hurdle in its application. One of the best known quantifications of persistence for multiparameter persistent homology is the rank invariant, which has recently evolved into the generalized rank invariant by naturally extending its domain. This extension enables us to quantify 'persistence' across a broader range of regions in the indexing poset compared to the rank invariant.
  However, the size of the domain of the generalized rank invariant is generally formidable, making it desirable to restrict its domain to a more manageable subset for computational purposes. The foremost questions regarding such a restriction of the domain are: (1) How to restrict, if possible, the domain of the generalized rank invariant without any loss of information? (2) When can we more compactly encode the generalized rank invariant as a `persistence diagram'? (3) What is the trade-off between computational efficiency and the discriminating power of the generalized rank invariant as the amount of the restriction on the domain varies?
  To address these questions, we generalize and axiomatize the classic fundamental lemma of persistent homology via the notion of M\"obius invertibility of the generalized rank invariant which we propose. This extension also contextualizes known results regarding the (generalized) rank invariant within the classical theory of M\"obius inversion. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between M\"obius invertibility and other existing concepts related to the structural simplicity of persistence modules, such as Miller's notion of tameness. During this investigation, we identify an example of a persistence module whose generalized rank invariant is not M\"obius invertible.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality for Generalized Persistence Diagrams of (co)Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We dualize previous work on generalized persistence diagrams for filtrations to cofiltrations. When the underlying space is a manifold, we express this duality as a Poincar\'e duality between their generalized persistence diagrams. A heavy emphasis is placed on the recent discovery of functoriality of the generalized persistence diagram and its connection to Rota's Galois Connection Theorem.</description>
