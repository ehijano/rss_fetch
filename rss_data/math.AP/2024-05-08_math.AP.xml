      <title>Regularity for Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations with Natural Growth in Gradient and Singular Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider the following boundary value problem
  \begin{equation*}\label{abs} \left\{ \begin{aligned} F(x,u,Du,D^{2}u)+c(x)u+ p(x)u^{-\alpha}&amp;=0~\text{in}~\Omega\\ u&amp;=0~~\text{on}~~\partial\Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a bounded and $C^{2}$ smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and $F$ has superlinear growth in gradient and $c(c)&lt;-c_{0}$ for some positive constant $c_{0}.$ Here, we studies the boundary behaviour of the solutions to above equation and establishes the global regularity result similar to one established in [12,16] with linear growth in gradient.</description>

      <title>A note on H\"older regularity of weak solutions to linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that weak solutions of $$-\text{div} \mathbb{A}(x)\nabla u = 0 \qquad \text{where}\quad \mathbb{A}(x)= \mathbb{A}(x)^T \,\, \text{and} \,\, \lambda |\zeta|^2 \leq \langle \mathbb{A}(x)\zeta,\zeta\rangle \leq \Lambda |\zeta|^2,$$
  and $\mathbb{A}(x) \equiv \mathbb{A}$ is a constant matrix are H\"older continuous $u \in C^{\alpha}_{\text{loc}}$ with $\alpha \geq \frac12 \left(-(n-2) + \sqrt{(n-2)^2 + \frac{4(n-1)\lambda}{\Lambda}} \right)$. This implies that the example constructed by Piccinini - Spagnolo is sharp in the class of constant matrices $\mathbb{A}(x) \equiv \mathbb{A}$. The proof of H\"older regularity does not go through a reduction of oscillation type argument and instead is achieved through a monotonicity formula.
  In the case of general matrices $\mathbb{A}(x)$, we obtain the same regularity under some additional hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson systems in dimension two: the zero mass case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an existence result for a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system in gradient form, set in the whole plane, in the case of zero mass. Since the setting is limiting for the Sobolev embedding, we admit nonlinearities with subcritical or critical growth in the sense of Trudinger-Moser. In particular, the absence of the mass term requires a nonstandard functional framework, based on homogeneous Sobolev spaces. These features, combined with the logarithmic behaviour of the kernel of the Poisson equation, make the analysis delicate, since standard variational tools cannot be applied. The system is solved by considering the corresponding logarithmic Choquard equation. We prove the existence of a mountain pass-type solution via a careful analysis on specific Cerami sequences, whose boundedness is achieved by exploiting an appropriate functional, obtained by evaluating the energy functional on particular paths.</description>

      <title>Stability of traveling waves in non-cooperative systems with nonlocal dispersal of equal diffusivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first prove a stability theorem for traveling waves in a class of non-cooperative reaction-diffusion systems with nonlocal dispersal of equal diffusivities. Our stability criterion is in the sense that the initial perturbation is such that a suitable weighted relative entropy function is bounded and integrable. Then we apply our main theorem to derive the stability of traveling waves for some specific examples of non-cooperative systems arising in ecology and epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous wave kinetic equation and its hierarchy in polynomially weighted $L^\infty$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by ideas stemming from the analysis of the Boltzmann equation, in this paper we expand well-posedness theory of the spatially inhomogeneous 4-wave kinetic equation, and also analyze an infinite hierarchy of PDE associated with this nonlinear equation. More precisely, we show global in time well-posedness of the spatially inhomogeneous 4-wave kinetic equation for polynomially decaying initial data. For the associated infinite hierarchy, we construct global in time solutions using the solutions of the wave kinetic equation and the Hewitt-Savage theorem. Uniqueness of these solutions is proved by using a combinatorial board game argument tailored to this context, which allows us to control the factorial growth of the Dyson series.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the uniqueness of the mild solution of the two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic equation with the critical dissipation holds in the scaling critical homogeneous Besov space $\dot{B}^0_{\infty,1}$. We consider a solustion of integral equation, and our result does not need regularity assumption.</description>

      <title>Weak and Perron's Solutions to Linear Kinetic Fokker-Planck Equations of Divergence Form in Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate weak solutions and Perron-Wiener-Brelot solutions to the linear kinetic Fokker-Planck equation in bounded domains. We establish the existence of weak solutions by applying the Lions-Lax-Milgram theorem and the vanishing viscosity method in product domains. Additionally, we demonstrate the regularity of weak solutions and establish a strong maximum principle. Furthermore, we construct a Perron solution and provide examples of barriers in arbitrary bounded domains. Our findings are based on recent advancements in the theory of kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with rough coefficients, particularly focusing on the characterization of a weaker notion of trace defined through convolution-translation.</description>

      <title>Existence and dynamical behaviour of vectorial standing waves with prescribed mass for Hartree-Fock type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate vectorial standing waves with prescribed mass for the Hartree-Fock type system (HF system) with the double coupled feature. Such system is viewed as an approximation of the Coulomb system with two particles appeared in quantum mechanics. By exploring the interaction of the double coupled terms, we prove the exis?tence/nonexistence and symmetry of vectorial energy ground states for the corresponding stationary problem. Furthermore, we obtain the relation between vectorial energy ground states and vectorial action ground states in some cases. Finally, we establish conditions for global well-posedness and finite time blow-up to HF system with the initial data, and prove orbital stability/strong instability of standing waves.</description>

      <title>Two uniqueness results in the inverse boundary value problem for the weighted p-Laplace equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a general uniqueness result in the inverse boundary value problem for the weighted p-Laplace equation in the plane, with smooth weights. We also prove a uniqueness result in dimension 3 and higher, for real analytic weights that are subject to a smallness condition on one of their directional derivatives. Both results are obtained by linearizing the equation at a solution without critical points. This unknown solution is then recovered, together with the unknown weight.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an epidemic model with nonlocal di?usion and a free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An epidemic model, where the dispersal is approximated by nonlocal diffusion operator and spatial domain has one ?xed boundary and one free boundary, is considered in this paper. Firstly, using some elementary analysis instead of variational characterization, we show the existence and asymptotic behaviors of the principal eigenvalue of a cooperative system which can be used to characterize more epidemic models, not just ours. Then we study the existence, uniqueness and stability of a related steady state problem. Finally, we obtain a rather complete understanding for long time behaviors, spreading-vanishing dichotomy, criteria for spreading and vanishing, and spreading speed. Particularly, we prove that the asymptotic spreading speed of solution component (u; v) is equal to the spreading speed of free boundary which is ?nite if and only if a threshold condition holds for kernel functions.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the existence of solutions for a class of Ambrosetti-Prodi type systems involving the fractional Laplacian operator and with nonlinearities reaching critical growth and interacting, in some sense, with the spectrum of the operator. The resonant case in $\lambda_{k,s}$ for $k&gt;1$ is also investigated.</description>

      <title>On the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to elliptic equations with a singular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Dirichlet problem for a scalar elliptic equation in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^3$ with a singular drift of the form $b_0= b-\alpha \frac {x'}{|x'|^2}$ where $x'=(x_1,x_2,0)$, $\alpha \in \mathbb R$ is a parameter and $b$ is a divergence free vector field having essentially the same regularity as the potential part of the drift. Such drifts naturally arise in the theory of axially symmetric solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. For $\alpha &lt;0$ the divergence of such drifts is positive which potentially can ruin the uniqueness of solutions. Nevertheless, for $\alpha&lt;0$ we prove existence and H\"older continuity of a unique weak solution which vanishes on the axis $\Gamma:=\{ ~x\in \mathbb R^3:~|x'|=0~\}$.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotics of a heated string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study a model of a thermoelastic string that is initially heated. We classify all the possible asymptotic states when time tends to infinity of such a model. Actually, we show that whatever the initial data is, a heated string must converge to a flat, steady string with uniformly distributed heat. The latter distribution is calculated from the energy conservation. In order to obtain the result, we need to take a few steps. In the first two steps, time-independent bounds from above and from below (by a positive constant) of the temperature are obtained. This is done via the Moser-like iteration. The lower bound is obtained via the Moser iteration on the negative part of the logarithm of temperature. In the third step, we obtain a time-independent higher-order estimate, which yields compactness of a sequence of the values of the solution when time tends to infinity. Here, an estimate involving the Fisher information of temperature, together with a recent functional inequality from \cite{CFHS} and an $L^2(L^2)$ estimate of the gradient of entropy, enable us to arrive at a tricky Gr\"{o}nwall type inequality. Finally, in the last steps, we define the dynamical system on a proper functional phase space and study its $\omega$-limit set. To this end, we use, in particular, the quantitative version of the second principle of thermodynamics. Also, the entropy dissipation term and the bound of the entropy from below are useful when identifying the structure of the $\omega$-limit set.</description>

      <title>Stress solution of static linear elasticity with mixed boundary conditions via adjoint linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit stress problems in linear elasticity to provide a perspective from the geometrical and functionalanalytic points of view. For the static stress problem of linear elasticity with mixed boundary conditions we write the associated pair of unbounded adjoint operators. The stress solution is found as an intersection of affine translations of the fundamental subspaces of the adjoint operators. In particular, we treat the equilibrium equation in the operator form, involving spaces of traces on a part of the boundary, known as Lions-Magenes spaces. Our analysis of the pair of adjoint operators for the problem with mixed boundary conditions relies on the properties of the analogous pair of operators for the problem with the displacement boundary conditions, which we also include in the paper.</description>

      <title>Overdetermined elliptic problems in nontrivial exterior domains of the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct nontrivial unbounded domains $\Omega$ in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^N$, $N \in \{2,3,4\}$, bifurcating from the complement of a ball, such that the overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -\Delta_{\mathbb{H}^N} u+u-u^p=0\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \,\, u=0,\,\,\partial_\nu u=\text{const}\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega\nonumber \end{equation} has a positive bounded solution in $C^{2,\alpha}\left(\Omega\right) \cap H^1\left(\Omega\right)$. We also give a condition under which this construction holds for larger dimensions $N$. This is linked to the Berestycki-Caffarelli-Nirenberg conjecture on overdetermined elliptic problems, and, as far as we know, is the first nontrivial example of solution to an overdetermined elliptic problem in the hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Boundary unique continuation in planar domains by conformal mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a chord arc domain with small constant. We show that a nontrivial harmonic function which vanishes continuously on a relatively open set of the boundary cannot have the norm of the gradient which vanishes on a subset of positive surface measure (arc length). This result was previously known to be true, and conjectured in higher dimensions by Lin, in Lipschitz domains. Let now $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a $C^1$ domain with Dini mean oscillations. We prove that a nontrivial harmonic function which vanishes continuously on a relatively open subset of the boundary $\partial\Omega\cap B_1$ has a finite number of critical points in $\overline\Omega\cap B_{1/2}$. The latter improves some recent results by Kenig and Zhao. Our technique involves a conformal mapping which moves the boundary where the harmonic function vanishes into an interior nodal line of a new harmonic function, after a further reflection. Then, size estimates of the critical set - up to the boundary - of the original harmonic function can be understood in terms of estimates of the interior critical set of the new harmonic function and of the critical set - up to the boundary - of the conformal mapping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will revisit the classical questions of understanding the statistics of various deterministic dynamics of $N$ hard spheres of diameter $\varepsilon$ with random initial data in the Boltzmann-Grad scaling as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero and $N$ tends to infinity. The convergence of the empiric particle dynamics to the Boltzmann-type dynamics is shown using semigroup methods to describe probability measures on collision trees associated to physical trajectories in the case of a Rayleigh gas. As an application we derive the diffusion equation by a further rescaling.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Landau damping and wave operators in sharp Gevrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove nonlinear Landau damping in optimal weighted Gevrey-3 spaces for solutions of the confined Vlasov-Poisson system on $\T^d\times\R^d$ which are small perturbations of homogeneous Penrose-stable equilibria.
  We also prove the existence of nonlinear scattering operators associated to the confined Vlasov-Poisson evolution, as well as suitable injectivity properties and Lipschitz estimates (also in weighted Gevrey-3 spaces) on these operators.
  Our results give definitive answers to two well-known open problems in the field, both of them stated in the recent review of Bedrossian  [4, Section 6].</description>

      <title>Harnack inequality for parabolic equations in double-divergence form with singular lower order coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Harnack inequality for nonnegative solutions to second-order parabolic equations in double divergence form. We impose conditions where the principal coefficients satisfy the Dini mean oscillation condition in $x$, while the drift and zeroth-order coefficients belong to specific Morrey classes. Our analysis contributes to advancing the theoretical foundations of parabolic equations in double divergence form, including Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations for probability densities.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic lattice models for flows with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many fundamental problems in fluid dynamics are related to the effects of solid boundaries. In general, they install sharp gradients and contribute to the developement of small-scale structures, which are computationally expensive to resolve with numerical simulations. A way to access extremely fine scales with a reduced number of degrees of freedom is to consider the equations on logarithmic lattices in Fourier space. Here we introduce new toy models for flows with walls, by showing how to add boundaries to the logarithmic lattice framework. The resulting equations retain many important properties of the original systems, such as the conserved quantities, the symmetries and the boundary effects. We apply this technique to many flows, with emphasis on the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations. For this setup, simulations reach impressively large Reynolds numbers and disclose interesting insights about the original problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on compact K\"ahler manifolds with semiample canonical bundle and intermediate Kodaira dimension, and show that the flow collapses to a canonical metric on the base of the Iitaka fibration in the locally smooth topology and with bounded Ricci curvature away from the singular fibers. This follows from an asymptotic expansion for the evolving metrics, in the spirit of recent work of the first and third-named authors on collapsing Calabi-Yau metrics, and proves two conjectures of Song and Tian.</description>

      <title>A characterization of wavelet sets on Vilenkin groups with its application to construction of MRA wavelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Vilenkin group. In 2008, Y. A. Farkov constructed wavelets on $G$ via the multiresolution analysis method. In this article, a characterization of wavelet sets on $G$ is established, which provides another method for the construction of wavelets. As an application, the relation between multiresolution analyses and wavelets determined from wavelet sets is also presented. To some extent, these results positively answer a question mentioned by P. Mahapatra and D. Singh in [Bull. Sci. Math. 167 (2021), Paper No. 102945, 20 pp].</description>

      <title>Classification of solutions to the isotropic horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{LX}, the first author and Xu introduced and studied the horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$. In particular, they established the uniqueness result for solutions to this problem when the prescribed function is constant and $p\ge -n$. This paper focuses on the isotropic horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^{2}$, which corresponds to the equation \begin{equation}\label{0}
  \varphi^{-p}\left(\varphi_{\theta\theta}-\frac{\varphi_{\theta}^2}{2\varphi}+\frac{\varphi-\varphi^{-1}}{2}\right)=\gamma\quad\text{on}\ \mathbb{S}^1, \end{equation} where $\gamma$ is a positive constant. We provide a classification of solutions to the above equation for $p\ge -7$, as well as a nonuniqueness result of solutions for $p&lt;-7$. Furthermore, we extend this problem to the isotropic horospherical $q$-weighted $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane and derive some uniqueness and nonuniqueness results.</description>

      <title>Geodesic connectivity and rooftop envelopes in the Cegrell classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines geodesics and plurisubharmonic envelopes within the Cegrell classes on bounded hyperconvex domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We establish that solutions possessing comparable singularities to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation are identical, affirmatively addressing a longstanding open question raised by Cegrell. This achievement furnishes the most general form of the Bedford-Taylor comparison principle within the Cegrell classes. Building on this foundational result, we explore plurisubharmonic geodesics, broadening the criteria for geodesic connectivity among plurisubharmonic functions with connectable boundary values. Our investigation also delves into the notion of rooftop envelopes, revealing that the rooftop equality condition and the idempotency conjecture are valid under substantially weaker conditions than previously established, a finding made possible by our proven uniqueness result. The paper concludes by discussing the core open problems within the Cegrell classes related to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation.</description>

Abstract: Suppose that a countably $n$-rectifiable set $\Gamma_0$ is the support of a multiplicity-one stationary varifold in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with a point admitting a flat tangent plane $T$ of density $Q \geq 2$. We prove that, under a suitable assumption on the decay rate of the blow-ups of $\Gamma_0$ towards $T$, there exists a non-constant Brakke flow starting with $\Gamma_0$. This shows non-uniqueness of Brakke flow under these conditions, and suggests that the stability of a stationary varifold with respect to mean curvature flow may be used to exclude the presence of flat singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Cauchy problem for an energy-supercritical nonlinear wave equation in odd space dimensions that arises in equivariant Yang-Mills theory. In each dimension, there is a self-similar finite-time blowup solution to this equation known in closed form. It will be proved that this profile is stable in the whole space under small perturbations of the initial data. The blowup analysis is based on a recently developed coordinate system called hyperboloidal similarity coordinates and depends crucially on growth estimates for the free wave evolution, which will be constructed systematically for odd space dimensions in the first part of this paper. This allows to develop a nonlinear stability theory beyond the singularity.</description>

Abstract: We consider the wave equation with focusing power nonlinearity. The associated ODE in time gives rise to a self-similar solution known as the ODE blowup. We prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of this blowup mechanism outside of radial symmetry in all space dimensions and for all superlinear powers. This result covers for the first time the whole energy-supercritical range without symmetry restrictions.</description>

Abstract: Starting from a characterization of holomorphic functions in terms of a suitable mean value property, we build some nonlinear asymptotic characterizations for complex-valued solutions of certain nonlinear systems, which have to do with the classical Cauchy-Riemann equations. From these asymptotic characterizations, we derive suitable asymptotic mean value properties, which are used to construct appropriate vectorial dynamical programming principles. The aim is to construct approximation schemes for the so-called contact solutions, recently introduced by N. Katzourakis, of the nonlinear systems here considered.</description>

      <title>On some isoperimetric inequalities for the Newtonian capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upper bounds are obtained for the Newtonian capacity of compact sets in $\R^d,\,d\ge 3$ in terms of the perimeter of the $r$-parallel neighbourhood of $K$. For compact, convex sets in $\R^d,\,d\ge 3$ with a $C^2$ boundary the Newtonian capacity is bounded from above by $(d-2)M(K)$, where $M(K)&gt;0$ is the integral of the mean curvature over the boundary of $K$ with equality if $K$ is a ball. For compact, convex sets in $\R^d,\,d\ge 3$ with non-empty interior the Newtonian capacity is bounded from above by $\frac{(d-2)P(K)^2}{d|K|}$ with equality if $K$ is a ball. Here $P(K)$ is the perimeter of $K$ and $|K|$ is its measure. A quantitative refinement of the latter inequality in terms of the Fraenkel asymmetry is also obtained. An upper bound is obtained for expected Newtonian capacity of the Wiener sausage in $\R^d,\,d\ge 5$ with radius $\varepsilon$ and time length $t$.</description>

Abstract: Consider the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky system in $\mathbb{R}^3$: $$ \begin{cases} -\varepsilon^2 \Delta u + (V + \phi) u = u |u|^{p-1}; \\ a^2 \Delta^2 \phi - \Delta \phi = 4 \pi u^2, \end{cases} $$ where $a, \varepsilon &gt; 0$; $1 &lt; p &lt; 5$; $V \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to ]0, \infty[$ and we want to solve for $u, \phi \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$. By means of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we show that if $K \geq 2$, $z_0$ is a strict local minimum of $V$, $V$ is adequately flat in a neighborhood of $z_0$ and $\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small, then the system has a multipeak cluster solution with $K$ peaks placed at the vertices of a regular convex $K$-gon centered at $z_0$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, for any odd $n$ and any integer $m\geq1$, we study the fundamental solution of the higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \mathrm{i}\partial_tu(x,t)=((-\Delta)^m+V(x))u(x,t), \quad t\in \mathbb{R},\,\,x\in \mathbb{R}^n, \end{equation*} where $V$ is a real-valued potential with certain decay, smoothness, and spectral properties. Let $P_{ac}(H)$ denote the projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H=(-\Delta)^m+V$. Our main result says that $e^{-\mathrm{i} tH}P_{ac}(H)$ has integral kernel $K(t,x,y)$ satisfying \begin{equation*} |K(t, x,y)|\le C (1+|t|)^{-h}(1+|t|^{-\frac{n}{2 m}})\left(1+|t|^{-\frac{1}{2 m}}|x-y|\right)^{-\frac{n(m-1)}{2 m-1}},\quad t\neq0,\,x,y\in\mathbb{R}^n, \end{equation*} where the constants $C, h&gt;0$, and $h$ can be specified by $m, n$ and the spectral property of $H$.</description>

Abstract: We prove an existence result for a $p$-Laplacian problem set in the whole Euclidean space and exhibiting a critical term perturbed by a singular, convective reaction. The approach used combines variational methods, truncation techniques, and concentration compactness arguments, together with set-valued analysis and fixed point theory. De Giorgi's technique, a priori gradient estimates, and nonlinear regularity theory are employed to get local $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of solutions, as well as their pointwise decay at infinity. The result is new even in the non-singular case, also for the Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive estimates for the Hessian of the logarithm (log-Hessian) for solutions to the heat equation. For initial data in the form of log-Lipschitz perturbation of strongly log-concave measures, the log-Hessian admits an explicit, uniform (in space) lower bound. This yields a new estimate for the Lipschitz constant of a transport map pushing forward the standard Gaussian to a measure in this class. Further connections are discussed with score-based diffusion models and improved Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Finally, we show that assuming only fast decay of the tails of the initial datum does not suffice to guarantee uniform log-Hessian upper bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations in a half-line and study the time-asymptotic behavior toward the outgoing viscous shock wave. Precisely, we consider the two boundary problems: impermeable wall and inflow problems, where the velocity at the boundary is given as a constant state. For both problems, when the asymptotic profile determined by the prescribed constant states at the boundary and far-fields is a viscous shock, we show that the solution asymptotically converges to the shifted viscous shock profiles uniformly in space, under the condition that initial perturbation is small enough in H1 norm. We do not impose the zero mass condition on initial data, which improves the previous results by Matsumura and Mei [20] for impermeable case, and by Huang, Matsumura and Shi [8] for inflow case. Moreover, for the inflow case, we remove the assumption in [8]. Our results are based on the method of a-contraction with shifts, as the first extension of the method to the boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>$k$-convex hypersurfaces with prescribed Weingarten curvature in warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Weingarten curvature equations for $k$-convex hypersurfaces with $n&lt;2k$ in a warped product manifold $\overline{M}=I\times_{\lambda}M$. Based on the conjecture proposed by Ren-Wang in \cite{Ren2}, which is valid for $k\geq n-2$, we derive curvature estimates for equation $\sigma_k(\kappa)= \psi (V, \nu (V))$ through a straightforward proof. Furthermore, we also obtain an existence result for the star-shaped compact hypersurface $\Sigma$ satisfying the above equation by the degree theory under some sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>A characterization of the subspace of radially symmetric functions in Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that any Sobolev norm of nonnegative integer order of radially symmetric functions is equivalent to a weighted Sobolev norm of their radial profile. This establishes in terms of weighted Sobolev spaces on an interval a complete characterization of radial Sobolev spaces, which was open until now. As an application, we give a description of Sobolev norms of corotational maps.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Fourier-Galerkin spectral method for the Boltzmann equation with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04083v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Fourier-Galerkin spectral method has been a popular approach for the numerical approximation of the deterministic Boltzmann equation with spectral accuracy rigorously proved. In this paper, we will show that such a spectral convergence of the Fourier-Galerkin spectral method also holds for the Boltzmann equation with uncertainties arising from both collision kernel and initial condition. Our proof is based on newly-established spaces and norms that are carefully designed and take the velocity variable and random variables with their high regularities into account altogether. For future studies, this theoretical result will provide a solid foundation for further showing the convergence of the full-discretized system where both the velocity and random variables are discretized simultaneously.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Delta as a Singular Potential for the 2D Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of distributionally generalized quantum theory, the object $H\psi$ is defined as a distribution. The mathematical significance is a mild generalization for the theory of para- and pseudo-differential operators (as well as a generalization of the weak eigenvalue problem), where the $\psi$-do symbol (which is not a proper linear operator in this generalized case) can have its coefficient functions take on singular distributional values. Here, a distribution is said to be singular if it is not L$^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any $p\geq 1$. Physically, the significance is a mathematically rigorous method, which does not rely upon renormalization or regularization of any kind, while producing bound state energy results in agreement with the literature. In addition, another benefit is that the method does not rely upon self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace operator. This is important when the theory is applied to non-Schrodinger systems, as is the case for the Dirac equation and a necessary property of any finite rigorous version of quantum field theory. The distributional interpretation resolves the need to evaluate a wave function at a point where it fails to be defined. For $d=2$, this occurs as $K_o(a|x|)\delta(x)$, where $K_o$ is the zeroth order MacDonald function. Finally, there is also the identification of a missing anomalous length scale, owing to the scale invariance of the formal symbol(ic) Hamiltonian, as well as the common identity for the logarithmic function, with $a,\,b\in\mathbb{R}^+$, $\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)$, which loses unitlessness in its arguments. Consequently, the energy or point spectrum is generalized as a family (set indexed by the continuum) of would-be spectral values, called the C-spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Euclidean-hyperboloidal foliation method. Application to f(R) modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a part of a series devoted to the Euclidean-hyperboloidal foliation method introduced by the authors for investigating the global existence problem associated with nonlinear systems of coupled wave-Klein-Gordon equations with small data. This method was developed especially for investigating the initial value problem for the Einstein-massive field system in wave gauge. Here, we study the (fourth-order) field equations of f(R) modified gravity and investigate the global dynamical behavior of the gravitational field in the near-Minkowski regime. We establish the existence of a globally hyperbolic Cauchy development approaching Minkowski spacetime (in spacelike, null, and timelike directions), when the initial data set is sufficiently close to an asymptotically Euclidean and spacelike hypersurface in Minkowski spacetime. We cast the (fourth-order) f(R)-field equations in the form of a second-order wave-Klein-Gordon system, which has an analogous structure to the Einstein-massive field system but, in addition, involves a (possibly small) effective mass parameter. We establish the nonlinear stability of the Minkowski spacetime in the context of f(R) gravity, when the integrand f(R) in the action functional can be taken to be arbitrarily close to the integrand R of the standard Hilbert-Einstein action.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of a semi-discretized numerical system for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Boltzmann equation with uncertainties and prove that the spectral convergence of the semi-discretized numerical system holds in a combined velocity and random space, where the Fourier-spectral method is applied for approximation in the velocity space whereas the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)-based stochastic Galerkin (SG) method is employed to discretize the random variable. Our proof is based on a delicate energy estimate for showing the well-posedness of the numerical solution as well as a rigorous control of its negative part in our well-designed functional space that involves high-order derivatives of both the velocity and random variables. This paper rigorously justifies the statement proposed in [Remark 4.4, J. Hu and S. Jin, J. Comput. Phys., 315 (2016), pp. 150-168].</description>

      <title>Interface Modes in Honeycomb Topological Photonic Structures with Broken Reflection Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical theory for Dirac points and interface modes in honeycomb topological photonic structures consisting of impenetrable obstacles. Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining $120^\circ$-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the boundary integral equation method to show the existence of Dirac points for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone. We then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with Dirac points differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the Dirac points and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the quantum valley Hall effect in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay exponentially away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the zigzag interface, the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces. Using the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.</description>
