      <title>Magnetic atoms with a large electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally show that an electric dipole moment of more than 1 Debye can be induced in the dysprosium (Dy) atom, in a long-lived state that is about 17513 cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state. This metastable state is part of a strongly coupled opposite-parity doublet. Using optically detected microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, we determine the approximately 1.12 cm$^{-1}$ doublet spacing for the five stable bosonic isotopes of Dy with kHz-level accuracy. From the shift of the microwave transition frequency in low electric fields (below 150 V/cm) and from optical spectra in high electric fields (up to 150 kV/cm), a reduced transition dipole moment of 7.65 $\pm$ 0.05 Debye between the doublet states is extracted. In high electric fields the doublet interacts with a third state at 17727 cm$^{-1}$, that connects to the ground state via an electric-dipole transition. The three-state Stark interaction enables preparation of Dy atoms in the metastable state via single-photon excitation from the ground state.</description>

      <title>Static Laboratory-Frame Polarization of a Trapped Molecular Ion for CP-Violation Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $\Omega/\Lambda$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.</description>

      <title>Robust Two-Qubit Geometric Phase Gates using Amplitude and Frequency Ramping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for generating entanglement between trapped atomic ions based on adiabatically ramped state-dependent forces. By ramping both the amplitude of the state-dependent force and the motional mode frequencies, we realize an entangling operation that is robust to motional mode occupation and drifts in the mode frequencies. We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Chirped magneto-optical trap of molybdenum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12291v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have directly loaded a cryogenic beam of molybdenum atoms into a magneto-optical trap. By chirping the detuning of the trapping lasers, we were able to enhance the number of atoms loaded into the trap by more than a factor of two. We optimize the trapped samples for atom number, temperature, and lifetime by varying the laser-cooling parameters. The laser-cooled molybdenum atoms are subsequently transferred to a magnetic trap where we achieve vacuum-limited lifetimes of 100\,ms. Comparison of magneto-optical trap and magnetic trap lifetimes allow us to extract partial decay rates of the $\text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4\rightarrow\text{a}\,^5\text{D}_4$ and $\text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4\rightarrow\text{a}\,^5\text{D}_3$ transitions. We also provide measurements of the isotope shifts for the $\text{a}\,^7\text{S}_3\rightarrow \text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4$ transition with up to four times better precision than previously reported. Finally, we discuss the prospect of applying the chriped magneto-optical trap to produce laser-cooled samples of MgF.</description>

      <title>Wigner representation enables the exact derivation of the atom interferometer phase, unlike the path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact expression for the phase of an atomic interferometer located in a non-inertial reference frame (platform) moving along an arbitrary trajectory and with an orientation that changes arbitrarily over time is obtained. This expression takes into account precisely gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, and gravity-gradient forces, which arise during the rotation of the gravity source at a permanent rate. To achieve this result, we utilized the equations for the atomic density matrix in the Wigner representation. Starting from the exact formula, we derived three new terms in the well-known limit of small rotation angles and short interrogation time, which are attributed to the rotation and translational motion of the platform.</description>

      <title>Probing the isolated vector magnetic field of structured laser beams by atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic fields are inherently coupled in an electromagnetic wave. However, structured light beams enable their spatial separation. In particular, azimuthally polarized laser beams exhibit a localized magnetic field on-axis without the electric counterpart. Recent study by Martin-Domene et al. [App. Phys. Lett. 124, 211101 (2024)] has shown that combining these beams enables the generation of locally isolated magnetic fields with a controllable direction and phase. In the present paper we propose a method to probe and characterize such magnetic fields by studying their interaction with a single trapped atom. In order to theoretically investigate magnetic sublevel populations and their dependence on the relative orientation and phase -- i.e. the polarization state -- of the isolated magnetic field, we use a time-dependent density-matrix method based on the Liouville-von Neumann equation. As illustrative cases, we consider the $2s^2 2p^2 \, {}^3P_0 \, - \, 2s^2 2p^2 \, {}^3P_1$, the $1s^2 2s^2 \, {}^1S_0 \, - \, 1s^2 2s 2p \, {}^3P_2$, and the $2 s^2 2p \, {}^2 P_{1/2} \, - \, 2 s^2 2p \, {}^2 P_{3/2}$ transitions in ${}^{40}$Ca$^{14+}$, ${}^{10}$Be, and ${}^{38}$Ar$^{13+}$, respectively. Our results indicate that monitoring atomic populations serves as an effective tool for probing isolated vector magnetic fields, which opens avenues for studying laser-induced processes in atomic systems where electric field suppression is critical.</description>

      <title>3D-printed components for electron-ion trapping: Pre-experimental tests of functionality and ultra-high vacuum compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</description>
