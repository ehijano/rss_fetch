      <title>Electron Acceleration via Trapping inside Ion Mirror-mode Structures within A Large-scale Magnetic Flux Rope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi acceleration is believed as a crucial process for the acceleration of energetic electrons within flux ropes (FRs) during magnetic reconnection. However, in finite-length FRs with a large core field, the finite contracting and the escaping of electrons along the axis can significantly limit the efficiency of Fermi acceleration. Using observations from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the magnetotail, we demonstrate that magnetic mirror structures inside the FR can effectively prevent the escape of energetic electrons and overcome the limitation of finite contraction. Energetic electrons were produced and formed a power-law energy distribution in these mirror structures. By evaluating the acceleration rates, we show that these energetic electrons can be continuously accelerated within the mirror structures near the central region of the FR. These results unveil a novel mechanism that is universally applicable to electron acceleration within FRs in space, laboratory, and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>What Causes Errors in Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind Modeling at L1 ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous ambient solar wind (SW) validation studies have reported on discrepancies between modeled and observed SW conditions at L1. They indicated that a major source of discrepancies stems from how we model the solar corona. Thus, enhancing predictive capabilities demands a thorough examination of coronal modeling. The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been a workhorse model that provides the near-Sun SW conditions. An important component of it is the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model. This study analyzes 15 different Carrington Rotations(CRs), and presents detailed analysis of CR 2052 to identify WSA model settings that lead to successful and erroneous SW predictions at Earth. For the events studied, we show that increasing the models grid resolution improves the open-close boundary identification. This results in better predicting the onset and duration of high-speed streams (HSSs). In addition, we find an optimized source surface height (R$_{ss}$) (lying between 1.8-3.1 R$_{\odot}$) further enhances HSS prediction accuracy for the studied events. A detailed analysis shows that changes in R$_{ss}$, (a) changes the Great Circle Angular Distance (GCAD) maps (at the solar surface) of the associated coronal holes and (b) changes the foot-point locations of the magnetic connectivities to the sub-Earth locations. These factors change the near-Sun SW speed, that eventually leads to uncertainties in speeds near Earth. We also investigate the usefulness of coronal hole observations in constraining R$_{ss}$ and SW solutions at Earth, and highlight their underutilized value in guiding the selection of magnetic maps for improved ambient solar wind modeling at L1.</description>
