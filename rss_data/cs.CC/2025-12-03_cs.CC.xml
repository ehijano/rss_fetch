      <title>A Tight Double-Exponentially Lower Bound for High-Multiplicity Bin Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a high-multiplicity Bin Packing instance $I$ with $d$ distinct item types. In 2014, Goemans and Rothvoss gave an algorithm with runtime ${{|I|}^2}^{O(d)}$ for this problem~[SODA'14], where $|I|$ denotes the encoding length of the instance $I$. Although, Jansen and Klein~[SODA'17] later developed an algorithm that improves upon this runtime in a special case, it has remained a major open problem by Goemans and Rothvoss~[J.ACM'20] whether the doubly exponential dependency on $d$ is necessary.
  We solve this open problem by showing that unless the ETH fails, there is no algorithm solving the high-multiplicity Bin Packing problem in time ${{|I|}^2}^{o(d)}$. To prove this, we introduce a novel reduction from 3-SAT. The core of our construction is efficiently encoding the entire information from a 3-SAT instance with $n$ variables into an ILP with $O(\log(n))$ variables.
  This result confirms that the Goemans and Rothvoss algorithm is best-possible for Bin Packing parameterized by the number $d$ of item sizes.</description>

      <title>Sampling Permutations with Cell Probes is Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we are given an infinite sequence of input cells, each initialized with a uniform random symbol from $[n]$. How hard is it to output a sequence in $[n]^n$ that is close to a uniform random permutation? Viola (SICOMP 2020) conjectured that if each output cell is computed by making $d$ probes to input cells, then $d\geq\omega(1)$. Our main result shows that, in fact, $d\geq (\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$, which is tight up to the constant in the exponent. Our techniques also show that if the probes are nonadaptive, then $d\geq n^{\Omega(1)}$, which is an exponential improvement over the previous nonadaptive lower bound due to Yu and Zhan (ITCS 2024). Our results also imply lower bounds against succinct data structures for storing permutations.</description>

      <title>Search versus Decision for $\mathsf{S}_2^\mathsf{P}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the complexity of the search and decision problems for the complexity class S2P. While Cai (2007) showed that the decision problem is contained in ZPP^NP, we show that the search problem is equivalent to TFNP^NP, the class of total search problems verifiable in polynomial time with an NP oracle. This highlights a significant contrast: if search reduces to decision for S2P, then $\Sigma_2^p \cap \Pi_2^p$ is contained in ZPP^NP.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Signed Roman Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a signed Roman dominating function is a function $f: V \rightarrow \{-1, 1, 2\}$ such that for every vertex $u \in V$: $\sum_{v \in N[u]} f(v) \geq 1$ and for every vertex $u \in V$ with $f(u) = -1$, there exists a vertex $v \in N(u)$ with $f(v) = 2$. The weight of a signed Roman dominating function $f$ is $\sum_{u \in V} f(u)$. The objective of \srd{} (SRD) problem is to compute a signed Roman dominating function with minimum weight. The problem is known to be NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs and planar graphs. In this paper, we advance the complexity study by showing that the problem remains NP-complete on split graphs. In the realm of parameterized complexity, we prove that the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by weight, even on bipartite graphs. We further show that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by feedback vertex set number (and hence also when parameterized by treewidth or clique-width). On the positive side, we present an FPT algorithm parameterized by neighbourhood diversity (and by vertex cover number). Finally, we complement this result by proving that the problem does not admit a polynomial kernel parameterized by vertex cover number unless coNP $\subseteq$ NP/poly.</description>

      <title>Devil's Games and $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$: Continuous Games complete for the First-Order Theory of the Reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the complexity class Quantified Reals ($\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$). Let FOTR be the set of true sentences in the first-order theory of the reals. A language $L$ is in $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$, if there is a polynomial time reduction from $L$ to FOTR. This seems the first time this complexity class is studied. We show that $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$ can also be defined using real Turing machines. It is known that deciding FOTR requires at least exponential time unconditionally [Berman, 1980].
  We focus on devil's games with two defining properties: (1) Players (human and devil) alternate turns and (2) each turn has a continuum of options.
  First, we show that FOTRINV is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. FOTRINV has only inversion and addition constraints and all variables are in a compact interval. FOTRINV is a stepping stone for further reductions.
  Second, we show that the Packing Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. In the Packing Game we are given a container and two sets of pieces. One set of pieces for the human and one set for the devil. The human and the devil alternate by placing a piece into the container. Both rotations and translations are allowed. The first player that cannot place a piece loses.
  Third, we show that the Planar Extension Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given a partially drawn plane graph and the human and the devil alternate by placing vertices and the corresponding edges in a straight-line manner. The vertices and edges to be placed are prescribed before hand. The first player that cannot place a vertex loses.
  Finally, we show that the Order Type Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given an order-type together with a linear order. The human and the devil alternate in placing a point in the Euclidean plane following the linear order. The first player that cannot place a point correctly loses.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Contracting Bipartite Graphs into Small Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $\ell \geq 3$, the $C_\ell$-Contractibility problem takes as input an undirected simple graph $G$ and determines whether $G$ can be transformed into a graph isomorphic to $C_\ell$ (the induced cycle on $\ell$ vertices) using only edge contractions. Brouwer and Veldman [JGT 1987] showed that $C_4$-Contractibility is NP-complete in general graphs. It is easy to verify that $C_3$-Contractibility is polynomial-time solvable. Dabrowski and Paulusma [IPL 2017] showed that $C_{\ell}$-Contractibility is \NP-complete\ on bipartite graphs for $\ell = 6$ and posed as open problems the status of the problem when $\ell$ is 4 or 5. In this paper, we show that both $C_5$-Contractibility and $C_4$-Contractibility are NP-complete on bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Hardness of monadic second-order formulae over succinct graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04522v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main result is a succinct counterpoint to Courcelle's meta-theorem as follows: every cw-nontrivial monadic second-order (MSO) property is either NP-hard or coNP-hard over graphs given by succinct representations. Succint representations are Boolean circuits computing the adjacency relation. Cw-nontrivial properties are those which have infinitely many models and infinitely many countermodels with bounded cliquewidth. Moreover, we explore what happens when the cw-nontriviality condition is dropped and show that, under a reasonable complexity assumption, the previous dichotomy fails, even for questions expressible in first-order logic.</description>

      <title>Complexity theory of orbit closure intersection for tensors: reductions, completeness, and graph isomorphism hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many natural computational problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and other sciences amount to deciding if two objects are equivalent. Often this equivalence is defined in terms of group actions. A natural question is to ask when two objects can be distinguished by polynomial functions that are invariant under the group action. For finite groups, this is the usual notion of equivalence, but for continuous groups like the general linear groups it gives rise to a new notion, called orbit closure intersection. It captures, among others, the graph isomorphism problem, noncommutative PIT, null cone problems in invariant theory, equivalence problems for tensor networks, and the classification of multiparty quantum states. Despite recent algorithmic progress in celebrated special cases, the computational complexity of general orbit closure intersection problems is currently quite unclear. In particular, tensors seem to give rise to the most difficult problems.
  In this work we start a systematic study of orbit closure intersection from the complexity-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we define a complexity class TOCI that captures the power of orbit closure intersection problems for general tensor actions, give an appropriate notion of algebraic reductions that imply polynomial-time reductions in the usual sense, but are amenable to invariant-theoretic techniques, identify natural tensor problems that are complete for TOCI, including the equivalence of 2D tensor networks with constant physical dimension, and show that the graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to these complete problems, hence GI$\subseteq$TOCI. As such, our work establishes the first lower bound on the computational complexity of orbit closure intersection problems, and it explains the difficulty of finding unconditional polynomial-time algorithms beyond special cases, as has been observed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Efficient Turing Machine Simulation with Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant bit-size Transformers are known to be Turing complete, but existing constructions require $\Omega(s(n))$ chain-of-thought (CoT) steps per simulated Turing machine (TM) step, leading to impractical reasoning lengths. In this paper, we significantly reduce this efficiency gap by proving that any $(t(n),s(n))$-bounded multi-tape TM can be simulated by a constant bit-size Transformer with an optimal $O(s(n))$-long context window and only $O(s(n)^c)$ CoT steps per TM step, where $c&gt;0$ can be made arbitrarily small by letting the Transformers' head-layer product sufficiently large. In addition, our construction shows that sparse attention with fixed geometric offsets suffices for efficient universal computation. Our proof leverages multi-queue TMs as a bridge. The main technical novelty is a more efficient simulation of multi-tape TMs by synchronous multi-queue TMs, improving both time and space complexity under stricter model assumptions.</description>

      <title>Improved Circuit Lower Bounds and Quantum-Classical Separations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the circuit class GC^0, which augments AC^0 with unbounded-fan-in gates that compute arbitrary functions inside a sufficiently small Hamming ball but must be constant outside it. While GC^0 can compute functions requiring exponential-size circuits, Kumar (CCC 2023) showed that switching-lemma lower bounds for AC^0 extend to GC^0 with no loss in parameters.
  We prove a parallel result for the polynomial method: any lower bound for AC^0[p] obtained via the polynomial method extends to GC^0[p] without loss in parameters. As a consequence, we show that the majority function MAJ requires depth-$d$ GC^0[p] circuits of size $2^{\Omega(n^{1/2(d-1)})}$, matching the best-known lower bounds for AC^0[p]. This yields the most expressive class of non-monotone circuits for which exponential-size lower bounds are known for an explicit function. We also prove a similar result for the algorithmic method, showing that E^NP requires exponential-size GCC^0 circuits, extending a result of Williams (JACM 2014).
  Finally, leveraging our improved classical lower bounds, we establish the strongest known unconditional separations between quantum and classical circuit classes. We separate QNC^0 from GC^0 and GC^0[p] in various settings and show that BQLOGTIME is not contained in GC^0. As a consequence, we construct an oracle relative to which BQP lies outside uniform GC^0, extending the Raz-Tal oracle separation between BQP and PH (STOC 2019).</description>

      <title>An Exponential Separation Between Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02087v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task.
  In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Projection-free Online Upper-Linearizable Optimization with Applications to DR-Submodular Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for decentralized projection-free optimization, extending projection-free methods to a broader class of upper-linearizable functions. Our approach leverages decentralized optimization techniques with the flexibility of upper-linearizable function frameworks, effectively generalizing traditional DR-submodular function optimization. We obtain the regret of $O(T^{1-\theta/2})$ with communication complexity of $O(T^{\theta})$ and number of linear optimization oracle calls of $O(T^{2\theta})$ for decentralized upper-linearizable function optimization, for any $0\le \theta \le 1$. This approach allows for the first results for monotone up-concave optimization with general convex constraints and non-monotone up-concave optimization with general convex constraints. Further, the above results for first order feedback are extended to zeroth order, semi-bandit, and bandit feedback.</description>

      <title>The Richness of CSP Non-redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), a clause is called redundant if its satisfaction is implied by satisfying all other clauses. An instance of CSP$(P)$ is called non-redundant if it does not contain any redundant clause. The non-redundancy (NRD) of a predicate $P$ is the maximum number of clauses in a non-redundant instance of CSP$(P)$, as a function of the number of variables $n$. Recent progress has shown that non-redundancy is crucially linked to many other important questions in computer science and mathematics including sparsification, kernelization, query complexity, universal algebra, and extremal combinatorics. Given that non-redundancy is a nexus for many of these important problems, the central goal of this paper is to more deeply understand non-redundancy.
  Our first main result shows that for every rational number $r \ge 1$, there exists a finite CSP predicate $P$ such that the non-redundancy of $P$ is $\Theta(n^r)$. Our second main result explores the concept of conditional non-redundancy first coined by Brakensiek and Guruswami [STOC 2025]. We completely classify the conditional non-redundancy of all binary predicates (i.e., constraints on two variables) by connecting these non-redundancy problems to the structure of high-girth graphs in extremal combinatorics.
  Inspired by these concrete results, we build off the work of Carbonnel [CP 2022] to develop an algebraic theory of conditional non-redundancy. As an application of this algebraic theory, we revisit the notion of Mal'tsev embeddings, which is the most general technique known to date for establishing that a predicate has linear non-redundancy. For example, we provide the first example of predicate with a Mal'tsev embedding that cannot be attributed to the structure of an Abelian group, but rather to the structure of the quantum Pauli group.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>

Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>
