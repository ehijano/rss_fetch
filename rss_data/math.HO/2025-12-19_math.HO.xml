      <title>The Diffusive Behavior of Solutions to the Linear Damped Wave Equation: an Undergraduate D.I.Y. Classnote</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite of the fact that the Damped Wave and the Heat equations describe phenomena of distinct nature, it is amazing that their solutions are related in the limit as $t \to \infty$. The aim of this note is to explain to undergraduate students, with a good calculus background, how the relation between these solutions is established. We follow a ``do it yourself'' strategy and the students are invited to do the suggested exercises in order to understand the content of this note.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gregorian quadrature, including end-corrected weights for the midpoint rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of numerical quadrature rules is derived, with equally-spaced nodes, and unit weights except at a few points at each end of the series, for which "corrections" (not using any further information about the integrand) are added to the unit weights. If the correction sequences overlap, the effects are additive. A fundamental parameter ("alpha") in the derivation is the distance from the endpoint of the range of integration to the first node, measured inward in step-lengths. Setting alpha to 1/2 yields a set of corrected composite midpoint rules. Setting alpha=0 yields Gregory's closed Newton-Cotes-like rules, including (for sufficient overlap) the standard closed Newton-Cotes rules (trapezoidal rule, "1/3 Simpson rule", "3/8 Simpson rule", "Boole's rule", etc.). Setting alpha=1 yields open N-C-like rules, again including the standard ones. A negative alpha means that the integrand is sampled outside the range of integration; suitably chosen negative values yield centered finite-difference end-corrections for the trapezoidal rule and the midpoint rule. One can even have different values of alpha at the two ends, yielding, inter alia, Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton weights. Thus the title could have been "Unified derivation of equispaced quadrature rules".</description>

      <title>Visualize Geometric Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.05062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review Mabry's, Edgar's, and the Viewpoints 2000 Group's proofs without words for the geometric series formula. Mabry and Edgar proved without words that
  $$\frac{1}{4} + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^3 + \cdots\ =\ \frac{3}{4}\quad\mbox{ and }\quad\frac{4}{9} + \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)^3 + \cdots\ =\ \frac{4}{5},$$
  respectively. We show that their proofs satisfy certain requirements that make them unique. We then illustrate a common idea between their and the Viewpoints 2000 Group's proofs.</description>

      <title>Weyl's Quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08562v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I argue against the predominant view of Weyl's interpretation of the logical signs. Drawing on his correctness-first account of mathematical knowledge, I point out that, according to him, quantified statements generate conditional obligations to act in ways that expand the repository of correct judgments. This clarifies Weyl's reasons for rejecting the law of excluded middle, which have nothing to do with what has been attributed to him by the predominant view. I also offer some preliminary thoughts on how to understand conditional obligations generated by statements with nested quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Advancing mathematics research with generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not primarily logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with neuro-symbolic solvers, Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>
