      <title>A comprehensive study of bound-states for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on single-knot metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and qualitative properties of action ground-states (that is, bound-states with minimal action) {of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation} over single-knot metric graphs -- which are made of half-lines, loops and pendants, all connected at a single vertex. First, we prove existence of action ground-state for generic single-knot graphs, even in the absence of an associated variational problem. Second, for regular single-knot graphs of length $\ell$, we perform a complete analysis of positive monotone bound-states. Furthermore, we characterize all positive bound-states when $\ell$ is small and prove some symmetry-breaking results for large $\ell$. Finally, we apply the results to some particular graphs to illustrate the complex relation between action ground-states and the topological {and metric} features of the underlying metric graph.
  The proofs are nonvariational, using a careful phase-plane analysis, the study of sections of period functions, asymptotic estimates and blowup arguments. We show, in particular, how nonvariational techniques are complementary to variational ones in order to deeply understand bound-states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on metric graphs.</description>

      <title>Compactness of the $Q$-curvature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete resolution to the question of the $C^4$-compactness for the solution set of the constant $Q$-curvature problem on a smooth closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $5 \leq n \leq 24$. For dimensions $n\geq 25$, an example of an $L^{\infty}$-unbounded sequence of solutions for $n \geq 25$ has been known for over a decade (Wei-Zhao). On the other hand, Li-Xiong established compactness in dimensions $5\leq n \leq 9$ (under some conditions). Our principal observation is that the linearized equation associated with the $Q$-curvature problem can be transformed into an overdetermined linear system, which admits a nontrivial solution due to an unexpected algebraic structure of the Paneitz operator. This key insight plays a crucial role in extending the compactness result to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Modelling Capillary Rise with a Slip Boundary Condition: Well-posedness and Long-time Dynamics of Solutions to Washburn's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend Washburn's capillary rise equation by incorporating a slip condition at the pipe wall. The governing equation is derived using fundamental principles from continuum mechanics. A new scaling is introduced, allowing for a systematic analysis of different flow regimes. We prove the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of a bounded positive solution to Washburn's equation that includes the slip parameter, as well as the continuous dependence of the solution in the maximum norm on the initial data. Thus, the initial-value problem for Washburn's equation is shown to be well-posed in the sense of Hadamard. Additionally, we show that the unique equilibrium solution may be reached either monotonically or in an oscillatory fashion, similarly to the no-slip case. Finally, we determine the basin of attraction for the system, ensuring that the equilibrium state will be reached from the initial data we impose. These results hold for any positive value of the nondimensional slip parameter in the model, and for all values of the ratio $h_0/h_e$ in the range $[0,3/2]$, where $h_0$ is the initial height of the fluid column and $h_e$ is its equilibrium height.</description>

      <title>Non-radiating elastic sources in inhomogeneous elastic media at corners with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with non-radiating elastic sources in inhomogeneous elastic media. We demonstrate that the value of non-radiating elastic sources must vanish at convex corners of their support, provided the sources exhibit H\"older continuous regularity near the corner. Additionally, their gradient must satisfy intricate algebraic relationships with the angles defining the underlying corners, assuming the sources have $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity with $\alpha\in (0,1)$ in the neighborhood of the corners. To perform microlocal analysis around the corners, we employ the so-called complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions as test functions within a partial differential system. These characterizations of non-radiating elastic sources in inhomogeneous elastic media at corners enable us to establish the unique identifiability results for determining the position and shape of radiating elastic sources by a single far-field measurement, both locally and globally. The uniqueness result by a single far-field measurement is a challenging problem with a colorful history in inverse scattering. Indeed, when the support of a radiating elastic source is a convex polygon, we can simultaneously determine the shape of the elastic source and its values at the corners, provided the source is H\"older continuous at the corner. Furthermore, when the source function exhibits $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity in the neighborhood of a corner, the gradient of the source function at that corner can also be generically determined.</description>

      <title>Concentration phenomena for a mixed local/nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Dirichlet datum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mixed local/nonlocal semilinear equation
  \begin{equation*}
  -\epsilon^{2}\Delta u +\epsilon^{2s}(-\Delta)^s u +u=u^p\qquad \text{in } \Omega
  \end{equation*} with zero Dirichlet datum, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is a small parameter, $s\in(0,1)$, $p\in(1,\frac{n+2}{n-2})$ and $\Omega$ is a smooth, bounded domain. We construct a family of solutions that concentrate, as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$, at an interior point of $\Omega$ having uniform distance to $\partial\Omega$ (this point can also be characterized as a local minimum of a nonlocal functional).
  In spite of the presence of the Laplace operator, the leading order of the relevant reduced energy functional in the Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure is polynomial rather than exponential in the distance to the boundary, in light of the nonlocal effect at infinity. A delicate analysis is required to establish some uniform estimates with respect to $\epsilon$, due to the difficulty caused by the different scales coming from the mixed operator.</description>

      <title>The effect of Q-condition in elliptic equations involving Hardy potential and singular convection term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an approach by contradiction we prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to a quasi-linear elliptic boundary value problem with singular convection term and Hardy Potential. Whose simplest model is
  \begin{equation*} \Scale[0.8]{\ds u \in W_0^{1,2}(\mathcal{O})\cap L^\infty(\mathcal{O}) : -\Delta u=-\mathcal{A}\text{div}\left(\frac{x}{\vert x\vert^2}u\right)+\lambda \frac{u}{\vert x\vert^2}+f(x),} \end{equation*} where \(\mathcal{O}\) is a bounded open set in \(\mathbb{R}^N\), $\left(\mathcal{A},\lambda\right) \in \left(0, \infty\right)^2$ and \(f\in W^{-1,2}(\mathcal{O})\).
  Additionally, by taking advantage of the regularizing effect of the interaction between the coefficient of the zero order term and the datum, we establish the existence, uniqueness and regularity of a weak solution to a quasi-linear boundary value problem whose simplest example is \begin{equation*} \Scale[0.8]{\ds u \in W_0^{1,2}(\mathcal{O})\cap L^\infty(\mathcal{O}) : -\Delta u +a(x)\vert u\vert^{p-2}u=-\mathcal{A}\text{div}\left(\frac{x}{\vert x\vert^2}u\right)+\lambda \frac{u}{\vert x\vert^2}+f(x),} \end{equation*} under suitable assumptions on $a$ and $f$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for elliptic system with Hamiltonian type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use Legendre-Fenchel transform and a space decomposition to carry out Fountain theorem and dual Fountain theorem for the following elliptic system of Hamiltonian type: \[ \begin{cases} \begin{aligned} -\Delta u&amp;=H_v(u, v) \,\quad&amp;&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ -\Delta v&amp;=H_u(u, v) \,\quad&amp;&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ u,\,v&amp;=0~~&amp;&amp;\text{on} ~ \partial\Omega,\\ \end{aligned} \end{cases} \] where $N\ge 1$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain and $H\in C^1( \mathbb{R}^2)$ is strictly convex, even and subcritical. We mainly present two results: (i) When $H$ is superlinear, the system has infinitely many solutions, whose energies tend to infinity. (ii) When $H$ is sublinear, the system has infinitely many solutions, whose energies are negative and tend to 0. As a byproduct, the Lane-Emden system under subcritical growth has infinitely many solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regularity for the supersolutions of the Evolutionary p-Laplace Equation is considered. In particular,the equivalence of viscosity supersolutions and p-supercaloric functions (lower semicontinuous supersolutions defined via a comparison principle) is considered. Bounded viscosity supersolutions are, in fact, weak supersolutions belonging to a natural Sobolev Space.</description>

      <title>Qualitative derivation of a density dependent incompressible Darcy law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first study of the homogenization of the 3D non-homogeneous incompressible Navier--Stokes system in perforated domains with holes of supercritical size. The diameter of the holes is of order $\varepsilon^{\alpha} \ (1&lt;\alpha&lt;3)$, where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is a small parameter measuring the mutual distance between the holes. We show that as $\varepsilon\to 0$, the asymptotic limit behavior of velocity and density is governed by Darcy's law under the assumption of a strong solution of the limiting system. Moreover, convergence rates are obtained. Finally, we show the existence of strong solutions to the inhomogeneous incompressible Darcy law, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates for elliptic equations with Carath\'eodory nonlinearities at the interior and on the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an explicit uniform a priori estimate for weak solutions to slightly subcritical elliptic problems with nonlinearities simultaneously at the interior and on the boundary. Our explicit $L^{\infty}(\Omega )$ a priori estimates are in terms of powers of their $H^{1}(\Omega )$ norms. To prove our result, we combine a De Giorgi-Nash-Moser's iteration scheme together with elliptic regularity and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg's interpolation inequality.</description>

      <title>Sharp conditions for the BBM formula and asymptotics of heat content-type energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $p\in[1,\infty)$, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions on the non-negative measurable kernels $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ ensuring convergence of the associated Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) energies $(\mathscr{F}_{t,p})_{t\in(0,1)}$ to a variant of the $p$-Dirichlet energy on $\mathbb R^N$ as $t\to0^+$ both in the pointwise and in the $\Gamma$-sense. We also devise sufficient conditions on $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ yielding local compactness in $L^p(\mathbb R^N)$ of sequences with bounded BBM energy. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions on $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ implying pointwise and $\Gamma$-convergence and compactness of $(\mathscr{F}_{t,p})_{t\in(0,1)}$ when the limit $p$-energy is of non-local type. Finally, we apply our results to provide asymptotic formulas in the pointwise and $\Gamma$-sense for heat content-type energies both in the local and non-local settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that stricty positive viscosity supersolutions to Trudinger's equation are local weak supersolutions when $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. As an application, we show using the Ishii-Lions method that not only viscosity but also weak solutions are Lipschitz continuous in the space variable. To the best of our knowledge, there is no preceding valid Lipschitz proofs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson system: well-posedness and (in)stability of the traveling waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Drinfeld-Sokolob-Wilson system, which features a dispersive, KdV type evolution with a dispersionless conservation law. We establish well-posedness with low regularity initial data $L^2({\mathbb T})\times L^2({\mathbb T})$ for the Cauchy problem on periodic background, which is then extrapolated to global solutions, due to $L^2$ conservation law. We also establish a dynamically more relevant result, namely a global persistence of solutions with (large) initial data in $H^1({\mathbb T})\times L^2({\mathbb T})$. This is obtained by following a more sophisticated approach, specifically the method of normal forms.
  Finally, for a fixed period $L$, we construct an explicit one parameter family of periodic waves, see \eqref{2.16} below. We show that they are all spectrally unstable with respect to co-periodic perturbations. Specifically, we show that the Hamiltonian instability index is equal to one, which identifies the instability as a single positive growing mode.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the time-space fractional differential equation of the Volterra type:
  \begin{align*}
  {D}^\alpha_{0 \vert t} (u) +(-\Delta_N)^{\sigma}u &amp;= u(1+au-bu^2)-au\int_0^t {K}(t-s) u(\cdot) \, ds,
  \end{align*}
  where $a,b&gt;0$ are given constants, $\alpha,\sigma \in (0,1)$, equipped with a homogeneous Neumann's boundary condition and a positive initial data. The boundedness and uniform continuity of the solution on the entire $\mathbb{R}^+$ are established. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of the positive solution is investigated.</description>

      <title>The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine sufficient conditions for overparametrized deep learning (DL) networks to guarantee the attainability of zero loss in the context of supervised learning, for the $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost and {\em generic} training data. We present an explicit construction of the zero loss minimizers without invoking gradient descent. On the other hand, we point out that increase of depth can deteriorate the efficiency of cost minimization using a gradient descent algorithm by analyzing the conditions for rank loss of the training Jacobian. Our results clarify key aspects on the dichotomy between zero loss reachability in underparametrized versus overparametrized DL.</description>

      <title>Sobolev embeddings on domains involving two types of symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that Sobolev embeddings can be improved in the presence of symmetries. In this article, we considere the situation in which given a domain $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a cylindrical symmetry, and acting a group $G$ in $\Omega_1$, for this situation it is shown that the critical Sobolev exponent increases in the case of embeddings into weighted spaces $L^{q}_{h}(\Omega)$. In this paper, we will enunciate several results related to compact embeddings of a Sobolev space with radially symmetric functions into some weighted space $L^{q}$, with $q$ higher than the usual critical exponent.</description>

      <title>On $L^p$-semigroup to Stokes equation with dynamic slip boundary condition in the half-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider evolutionary Stokes system, coupled with the so-called dynamic slip boundary condition, in the simple geometry of a $d$-dimensional half-space. Using the Fourier transform, we obtain an explicit formula for the resolvent. Optimal regularity estimates and existence of analytic semigroup in the $L^p$-setting are then deduced using the methods of $\mathcal{H}^{\infty}$-calculus.</description>

      <title>Stability and instability of the quasilinear Gross--Pitaevskii dark solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero conditions at infinity. In previous works, we obtained a continuous branch of traveling waves, given by dark solitons indexed by their speed. Neglecting the quasilinear term, one recovers the Gross--Pitaevskii equation, for which the branch of dark solitons is stable. Moreover, Z.~Lin showed that the Vakhitov--Kolokolov~(VK) stability criterion (in terms of the momentum of solitons) holds for general semilinear equations with nonvanishing conditions at infinity.
  In the quasilinear case, we prove that the VK stability criterion still applies, by generalizing Lin's arguments. Therefore, we deduce that the branch of dark solitons is stable for weak quasilinear interactions. For stronger quasilinear interactions, a cusp appears in the energy-momentum diagram, implying the stability of fast waves and the instability of slow waves.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of weak solutions to degenerate Kolmogorov equations of hypoelliptic type in bounded domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the boundedness of weak subsolutions for a class of degenerate Kolmogorov equations of hypoelliptic type, compatible with a homogeneous Lie group structure, within bounded product domains using the De Giorgi iteration. We employ the renormalization formula to handle boundary values and provide energy estimates. An $L^1$-$L^p$ type embedding estimate derived from the fundamental solution is utilized to incorporate lower-order divergence terms. This work naturally extends the boundedness theory for uniformly parabolic equations, with matching exponents for the coefficients.</description>

      <title>The 3D kinetic Couette flow via the Boltzmann equation in the diffusive limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper we study the Boltzmann equation in the diffusive limit in a channel domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times (-1,1)$ for the 3D kinetic Couette flow. Our results demonstrate that the first-order approximation of the solutions is governed by the perturbed incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system around the fluid Couette flow. Moverover, in the absence of external forces, the 3D kinetic Couette flow asymptotically converges over time to the 1D steady planar kinetic Couette flow. Our proof relies on (i) the Fourier transform on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to essentially reduce the 3D problem to a one-dimensional one, (ii) anisotropic Chemin-Lerner type function spaces, incorporating the Wiener algebra, to control nonlinear terms and address the singularity associated with a small Knudsen number in the diffusive limit, and (iii) Caflisch's decomposition, combined with the $L^2\cap L^\infty$ interplay technique, to manage the growth of large velocities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the initial-value problem for the Benjamin-Ono equation on $\mathbb{R}$ with $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ rational initial data with only simple poles can be solved in closed form via a determinant formula involving contour integrals. The dimension of the determinant depends on the number of simple poles of the rational initial data only and the matrix elements depend explicitly on the independent variables $(t,x)$ and the dispersion coefficient $\epsilon$. This allows for various interesting asymptotic limits to be resolved quite efficiently. As an example, and as a first step towards establishing the soliton resolution conjecture, we prove that the solution with initial datum equal to minus a soliton exhibits scattering.</description>

      <title>Rigidly breaking potential flows and a countable Alexandrov theorem for polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study all the ways that a given convex body in $d$ dimensions can break into countably many pieces that move away from each other rigidly at constant velocity, with no rotation or shearing. The initial velocity field is locally constant, but may be continuous and/or fail to be integrable. For any choice of mass-velocity pairs for the pieces, such a motion can be generated by the gradient of a convex potential that is affine on each piece. We classify such potentials in terms of a countable version of a theorem of Alexandrov for convex polytopes, and prove a stability theorem. For bounded velocities, there is a bijection between the mass-velocity data and optimal transport flows (Wasserstein geodesics) that are locally incompressible.
  Given any rigidly breaking velocity field that is the gradient of a continuous potential, the convexity of the potential is established under any of several conditions, such as the velocity field being continuous, the potential being semi-convex, the mass measure generated by a convexified transport potential being absolutely continuous, or there being a finite number of pieces. Also we describe a number of curious and paradoxical examples having fractal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the scattering of linear internal waves in a two dimensional channel with subcritical bottom topography. We construct the scattering matrix for the internal wave problem in a channel with straight ends, mapping incoming data to outgoing data; this operator turns out to differ by a smoothing operator from the pullback by the ``bounce map'' for boundary data obtained by ray-tracing. As a consequence we obtain unique solvability of the inhomogeneous stationary scattering problem subject to an appropriate outgoing radiation condition.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a paper by T. Chakradhar, K. Gittins, G. Habib and N.

This is an important step towards the analysis of the curvature effect in the case of general domains in $\mathbb R^2$.</description>

Abstract: We consider solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$ close to the Poiseuille flow with viscosity $0&lt; \nu &lt; 1$. For the linearized problem, we prove that when the $x$-frequency satisfy $|k| \ge \nu^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, the perturbation decays on a time-scale proportional to $\nu^{-\frac{1}{2}}|k|^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Since it decays faster than the heat equation, this phenomenon is referred to as enhanced dissipation. Then we concern the non-linear equations. We show that if the initial perturbation $\omega_{in}$ is of size at most $\nu^\frac{7}{3}$ in an anisotropic Sobolev space, then it remains so for all time.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there is no relaxation gap between a quasi-dissipative nonlinear evolution equation in a Hilbert space and its linear Liouville equation reformulation on probability measures. In other words, strong and generalized solutions of such equations are unique in the class of measure-valued solutions. As a major consequence, non-convex numerical optimization over these non-linear partial differential equations can be carried out with the infinite-dimensional moment-SOS hierarchy with global convergence guarantees. This covers in particular all reaction-diffusion equations with polynomial nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of any prescribed kinetic energy, we implement the intermittent convex integration scheme with $L^{q}$-normalized intermittent jets to give a direct proof for the existence of solution to the Navier-Stokes equation in $C_{t}L^{q}$ for some uniform $2&lt;q\ll3$ without the help of interpolation inequality. The result shows the sharp nonuniqueness that there evolve infinite nontrivial weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation starting from zero initial data. Furthermore, we improve the regularity of solution to be of $C_{t}W^{\alpha,q}$ in virtue of the fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities with some $0&lt;\alpha\ll1$. More importantly, the proof framework provides a stepping stone for future progress on the method of intermittent convex integration due to the fact that $L^{q}$-normalized building blocks carry the threshold effect of the exponent $q$ arbitrarily close to the critical value $3$.</description>

Abstract: We review a method to obtain optimal Poincar\'e-Hardy-type inequalities on the hyperbolic spaces, and discuss briefly generalisations to certain classes of Riemannian manifolds.
  Afterwards, we recall a corresponding result on homogeneous regular trees and provide a new proof using the aforementioned method. The same strategy will then be applied to obtain new optimal Hardy-type inequalities on weakly spherically symmetric graphs which include fast enough growing trees and anti-trees. In particular, this yields optimal weights which are larger at infinity than the optimal weights classically constructed via the Fitzsimmons ratio of the square root of the minimal positive Green's function.</description>

Abstract: The conformal heat flow of harmonic maps is a system of evolution equations combined with harmonic map flow with metric evolution in conformal direction. It is known that global weak solution of the flow exists and smooth except at mostly finitely many singular points. In this paper, we show that no finite time singularity occurs, unlike the usual harmonic map flow. And if the initial energy is small, we can obtain the uniform convergence of the map to a point and the conformal factor of the metric under some time sequence $t_n \to \infty$. Also, under the assumption that energy concentration is uniform in time, we show that there exists a sequence of time $t_n \to \infty$ such that $f(\cdot,t_n)$ converges to a harmonic map in $W^{1,2}$ on any compact set away from at most finitely many points.</description>

Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>
