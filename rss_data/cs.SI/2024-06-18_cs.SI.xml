      <title>Hierarchical Compression of Text-Rich Graphs via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-rich graphs, prevalent in data mining contexts like e-commerce and academic graphs, consist of nodes with textual features linked by various relations. Traditional graph machine learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), excel in encoding the graph structural information, but have limited capability in handling rich text on graph nodes. Large Language Models (LLMs), noted for their superior text understanding abilities, offer a solution for processing the text in graphs but face integration challenges due to their limitation for encoding graph structures and their computational complexities when dealing with extensive text in large neighborhoods of interconnected nodes. This paper introduces ``Hierarchical Compression'' (HiCom), a novel method to align the capabilities of LLMs with the structure of text-rich graphs. HiCom processes text in a node's neighborhood in a structured manner by organizing the extensive textual information into a more manageable hierarchy and compressing node text step by step. Therefore, HiCom not only preserves the contextual richness of the text but also addresses the computational challenges of LLMs, which presents an advancement in integrating the text processing power of LLMs with the structural complexities of text-rich graphs. Empirical results show that HiCom can outperform both GNNs and LLM backbones for node classification on e-commerce and citation graphs. HiCom is especially effective for nodes from a dense region in a graph, where it achieves a 3.48% average performance improvement on five datasets while being more efficient than LLM backbones.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptive Neighborhood for Advancing Temporal Interaction Graph Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated their remarkable performance in modeling temporal interaction graphs. These works can generate temporal node representations by encoding the surrounding neighborhoods for the target node. However, an inherent limitation of existing TGNs is their reliance on fixed, hand-crafted rules for neighborhood encoding, overlooking the necessity for an adaptive and learnable neighborhood that can accommodate both personalization and temporal evolution across different timestamps. In this paper, we aim to enhance existing TGNs by introducing an adaptive neighborhood encoding mechanism. We present SEAN, a flexible plug-and-play model that can be seamlessly integrated with existing TGNs, effectively boosting their performance. To achieve this, we decompose the adaptive neighborhood encoding process into two phases: (i) representative neighbor selection, and (ii) temporal-aware neighborhood information aggregation. Specifically, we propose the Representative Neighbor Selector component, which automatically pinpoints the most important neighbors for the target node. It offers a tailored understanding of each node's unique surrounding context, facilitating personalization. Subsequently, we propose a Temporal-aware Aggregator, which synthesizes neighborhood aggregation by selectively determining the utilization of aggregation routes and decaying the outdated information, allowing our model to adaptively leverage both the contextually significant and current information during aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments by integrating SEAN into three representative TGNs, evaluating their performance on four public datasets and one financial benchmark dataset introduced in this paper. The results demonstrate that SEAN consistently leads to performance improvements across all models, achieving SOTA performance and exceptional robustness.</description>

      <title>Model Evaluation and Anomaly Detection in Temporal Complex Networks using Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling complex networks allows us to analyze the characteristics and discover the basic mechanisms governing phenomena such as disease outbreaks, information diffusion, transportation efficiency, social influence, and even human brain function. Consequently, various network generative models (called temporal network models) have been presented to model how the network topologies evolve dynamically over time. Temporal network models face the challenge of results evaluation because common evaluation methods are appropriate only for static networks. This paper proposes an automatic approach based on deep learning to handle this issue. In addition to an evaluation method, the proposed method can also be used for anomaly detection in evolving networks. The proposed method has been evaluated on five different datasets, and the evaluations show that it outperforms the alternative methods based on the error rate measure in different datasets.</description>

      <title>Pay Attention to Weak Ties: A Heterogeneous Multiplex Representation Learning Framework for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn effective node representations that significantly improve link prediction accuracy. However, most GNN-based link prediction algorithms are incompetent to predict weak ties connecting different communities. Most link prediction algorithms are designed for networks with only one type of relation between nodes but neglect the fact that many complex systems, including transportation and social networks, consisting of multi-modalities of interactions that correspond to different nature of interactions and dynamics that can be modeled as multiplex network, where different types of relation are represented in different layers. This paper proposes a Multi-Relations-aware Graph Neural Network (MRGNN) framework to learn effective node representations for multiplex networks and make more accurate link predictions, especially for weak ties. Specifically, our model utilizes an intra-layer node-level feature propagation process and an inter-layer representation merge process, which applies a simple yet effective logistic or semantic attention voting mechanism to adaptively aggregate information from different layers. Extensive experiments on four diversified multiplex networks show that MRGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art multiplex link prediction algorithms on overall prediction accuracy, and works pretty well on forecasting weak ties</description>

      <title>Mapping Literary Space: A Social Network from the Timeline of Cultural Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies social network analysis (SNA) to explore the literary networks of St. Petersburg from 1999 to 2019. By analyzing data from the "SPbLitGuide" newsletter, which documents literary events and their participants, we map the connections and collaborations within the literary community. Our approach uses text processing, knowledge extraction, and geographic data to construct a detailed network graph. Using SNA algorithms, we identify key communities and influential figures. The analysis reveals a robust small-world network with strong local clustering and widespread collaboration. These findings provide insights into the structure and dynamics of literary groups in St. Petersburg and provide a foundation for further research in the digital humanities.</description>

      <title>Explainable assessment of financial experts' credibility by classifying social media forecasts and checking the predictions with actual market data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media include diverse interaction metrics related to user popularity, the most evident example being the number of user followers. The latter has raised concerns about the credibility of the posts by the most popular creators. However, most existing approaches to assess credibility in social media strictly consider this problem a binary classification, often based on a priori information, without checking if actual real-world facts back the users' comments. In addition, they do not provide automatic explanations of their predictions to foster their trustworthiness. In this work, we propose a credibility assessment solution for financial creators in social media that combines Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The reputation of the contributors is assessed by automatically classifying their forecasts on asset values by type and verifying these predictions with actual market data to approximate their probability of success. The outcome of this verification is a continuous credibility score instead of a binary result, an entirely novel contribution by this work. Moreover, social media metrics (i.e., user context) are exploited by calculating their correlation with the credibility rankings, providing insights on the interest of the end-users in financial posts and their forecasts (i.e., drop or rise). Finally, the system provides natural language explanations of its decisions based on a model-agnostic analysis of relevant features.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Unseen: Uncovering Human Trafficking Patterns in Job Listings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the shadow of the digital revolution, the insidious issue of human trafficking has found new breeding grounds within the realms of social media and online job boards. Previous research efforts have predominantly centered on identifying victims via the analysis of escort advertisements. However, our work shifts the focus towards enabling a proactive approach: pinpointing potential traffickers before they lure their preys through false job opportunities. In this study, we collect and analyze a vast dataset comprising over a quarter million job postings collected from eight relevant regions across the United States, spanning nearly two decades (2006-2024). The job boards we considered are specifically catered towards Chinese-speaking immigrants in the US. We classify the job posts into distinct groups based on the self-reported information of the posting user. Our investigation into the types of advertised opportunities, the modes of preferred contact, and the frequency of postings uncovers the patterns characterizing suspicious ads. Additionally, we highlight how external events such as health emergencies and conflicts appear to strongly correlate with increased volume of suspicious job posts: traffickers are more likely to prey upon vulnerable populations in times of crises. This research underscores the imperative for a deeper dive into how online job boards and communication platforms could be unwitting facilitators of human trafficking. More importantly, it calls for the urgent formulation of targeted strategies to dismantle these digital conduits of exploitation.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Elite and Mass Polarization in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for quantifying polarization in social networks typically report a single value describing the amount of polarization in a social system. While this approach can be used to confirm the observation that many societies have witnessed an increase in political polarization in recent years, it misses the complexities that could be used to understand the reasons behind this phenomenon. Notably, opposing groups can have unequal impact on polarization, and the elites are often understood to be more divided than the masses, making it critical to differentiate their roles in polarized systems. We propose a method to characterize these distinct hierarchies in polarized networks, enabling separate polarization measurements for these groups within a single social system. Applied to polarized topics in the Finnish Twittersphere surrounding the 2019 and 2023 parliamentary elections, our analysis reveals valuable insights: 1) The impact of opposing groups on observed polarization is rarely balanced, and 2) while the elite strongly contributes to structural polarization and consistently display greater alignment across various topics, the masses have also recently experienced a surge in issue alignment, a special form of polarization. Our findings suggest that the masses may not be as immune to an increasingly polarized environment as previously thought.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Inference and Experimental Design for Interference Using Partial Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stable unit treatment value assumption states that the outcome of an individual is not affected by the treatment statuses of others, however in many real world applications, treatments can have an effect on many others beyond the immediately treated. Interference can generically be thought of as mediated through some network structure. In many empirically relevant situations however, complete network data (required to adjust for these spillover effects) are too costly or logistically infeasible to collect. Partially or indirectly observed network data (e.g., subsamples, aggregated relational data (ARD), egocentric sampling, or respondent-driven sampling) reduce the logistical and financial burden of collecting network data, but the statistical properties of treatment effect adjustments from these design strategies are only beginning to be explored. In this paper, we present a framework for the estimation and inference of treatment effect adjustments using partial network data through the lens of structural causal models. We also illustrate procedures to assign treatments using only partial network data, with the goal of either minimizing estimator variance or optimally seeding. We derive single network asymptotic results applicable to a variety of choices for an underlying graph model. We validate our approach using simulated experiments on observed graphs with applications to information diffusion in India and Malawi.</description>

      <title>Mixed-resolution hybrid modeling in an element-based framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational modeling of a complex system is limited by the parts of the system with the least information. While detailed models and high-resolution data may be available for parts of a system, abstract relationships are often necessary to connect the parts and model the full system. For example, modeling food security necessitates the interaction of climate and socioeconomic factors, with models of system components existing at different levels of information in terms of granularity and resolution. Connecting these models is an ongoing challenge. In this work, we demonstrate methodology to quantize and integrate information from data and detailed component models alongside abstract relationships in a hybrid element-based modeling and simulation framework. In a case study of modeling food security, we apply quantization methods to generate (1) time-series model input from climate data and (2) a discrete representation of a component model (a statistical emulator of crop yield), which we then incorporate as an update rule in the hybrid element-based model, bridging differences in model granularity and resolution. Simulation of the hybrid element-based model recapitulated the trends of the original emulator, supporting the use of this methodology to integrate data and information from component models to simulate complex systems.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Effective Alternative to Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown impressive performance in graph representation learning, but they face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to their limited expressive power. To address this, Graph Transformers (GTs) were introduced, utilizing self-attention mechanism to effectively model pairwise node relationships. Despite their advantages, GTs suffer from quadratic complexity w.r.t. the number of nodes in the graph, hindering their applicability to large graphs. In this work, we present Graph-Enhanced Contextual Operator (GECO), a scalable and effective alternative to GTs that leverages neighborhood propagation and global convolutions to effectively capture local and global dependencies in quasilinear time. Our study on synthetic datasets reveals that GECO reaches 169x speedup on a graph with 2M nodes w.r.t. optimized attention. Further evaluations on diverse range of benchmarks showcase that GECO scales to large graphs where traditional GTs often face memory and time limitations. Notably, GECO consistently achieves comparable or superior quality compared to baselines, improving the SOTA up to 4.5%, and offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale graph learning.</description>

      <title>Deploying scalable traffic prediction models for efficient management in real-world large transportation networks during hurricane evacuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is vital for effective traffic management during hurricane evacuation. This paper proposes a predictive modeling system that integrates Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to capture both long-term congestion patterns and short-term speed patterns. Leveraging various input variables, including archived traffic data, spatial-temporal road network information, and hurricane forecast data, the framework is designed to address challenges posed by heterogeneous human behaviors, limited evacuation data, and hurricane event uncertainties. Deployed in a real-world traffic prediction system in Louisiana, the model achieved an 82% accuracy in predicting long-term congestion states over a 6-hour period during a 7-day hurricane-impacted duration. The short-term speed prediction model exhibited Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPEs) ranging from 7% to 13% across evacuation horizons from 1 to 6 hours. Evaluation results underscore the model's potential to enhance traffic management during hurricane evacuations, and real-world deployment highlights its adaptability and scalability in diverse hurricane scenarios within extensive transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Understanding Help-Seeking and Help-Giving on Social Media for Image-Based Sexual Abuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), like other forms of technology-facilitated abuse, is a growing threat to people's digital safety. Attacks include unwanted solicitations for sexually explicit images, extorting people under threat of leaking their images, or purposefully leaking images to enact revenge or exert control. In this paper, we explore how people seek and receive help for IBSA on social media. Specifically, we identify over 100,000 Reddit posts that engage relationship and advice communities for help related to IBSA. We draw on a stratified sample of 261 posts to qualitatively examine how various types of IBSA unfold, including the mapping of gender, relationship dynamics, and technology involvement to different types of IBSA. We also explore the support needs of victim-survivors experiencing IBSA and how communities help victim-survivors navigate their abuse through technical, emotional, and relationship advice. Finally, we highlight sociotechnical gaps in connecting victim-survivors with important care, regardless of whom they turn to for help.</description>

      <title>Problem-Solving in Language Model Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve the reasoning and question-answering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), several multi-agent approaches have been introduced. While these methods enhance performance, the application of collective intelligence-based approaches to complex network structures and the dynamics of agent interactions remain underexplored. This work extends the concept of multi-agent debate to more general network topologies, measuring the question-answering accuracy, influence, consensus, and the effects of bias on the collective. The results show that random networks perform similarly to fully connected networks despite using significantly fewer tokens. Furthermore, a strong consensus among agents in correlates with correct answers, whereas divided responses typically indicate incorrect answers. Analysing the influence of the agents reveals a balance between self-reflection and interconnectedness; self-reflection aids when local interactions are incorrect, and local interactions aid when the agent itself is incorrect. Additionally, bias plays a strong role in system performance with correctly biased hub nodes boosting performance. These insights suggest that using random networks or scale-free networks with knowledgeable agents placed in central positions can enhance the overall performance of multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Community Detection in Networks using Rough Sets and Consensus Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks, such as those in social, biological, and technological systems, often present challenges to the task of community detection. Our research introduces a novel rough clustering based consensus community framework (RC-CCD) for effective structure identification of network communities. The RC-CCD method employs rough set theory to handle uncertainties within data and utilizes a consensus clustering approach to aggregate multiple clustering results, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of community detection. This integration allows the RC-CCD to effectively manage overlapping communities, which are often present in complex networks.
  This approach excels at detecting overlapping communities, offering a detailed and accurate representation of network structures. Comprehensive testing on benchmark networks generated by the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi method showcased the strength and adaptability of the new proposal to varying node degrees and community sizes. Cross-comparisons of RC-CCD versus other well known detection algorithms outcomes highlighted its stability and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Who Checks the Checkers? Exploring Source Credibility in Twitter's Community Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms has become a significant concern. Initially designed for sharing information and fostering social connections, platforms like Twitter (now rebranded as X) have also unfortunately become conduits for spreading misinformation. To mitigate this, these platforms have implemented various mechanisms, including the recent suggestion to use crowd-sourced non-expert fact-checkers to enhance the scalability and efficiency of content vetting. An example of this is the introduction of Community Notes on Twitter.
  While previous research has extensively explored various aspects of Twitter tweets, such as information diffusion, sentiment analytics and opinion summarization, there has been a limited focus on the specific feature of Twitter Community Notes, despite its potential role in crowd-sourced fact-checking. Prior research on Twitter Community Notes has involved empirical analysis of the feature's dataset and comparative studies that also include other methods like expert fact-checking. Distinguishing itself from prior works, our study covers a multi-faceted analysis of sources and audience perception within Community Notes. We find that the majority of cited sources are news outlets that are left-leaning and are of high factuality, pointing to a potential bias in the platform's community fact-checking. Left biased and low factuality sources validate tweets more, while Center sources are used more often to refute tweet content. Additionally, source factuality significantly influences public agreement and helpfulness of the notes, highlighting the effectiveness of the Community Notes Ranking algorithm. These findings showcase the impact and biases inherent in community-based fact-checking initiatives.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bailouts in Diversified Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widespread default involves substantial deadweight costs which could be countered by injecting capital into failing firms. Injections have positive spillovers that can trigger a repayment cascade. But which firms should a regulator bailout so as to minimize the total injection of capital while ensuring solvency of all firms? While the problem is, in general, NP-hard, for a wide range of networks that arise from a stochastic block model, we show that the optimal bailout can be implemented by a simple policy that targets firms based on their characteristics and position in the network. Specific examples of the setting include core-periphery networks.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization via Graph Neural Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a ubiquitous scenario in the study of Influence Maximization (IM), in which there is limited knowledge about the topology of the diffusion network. We set the IM problem in a multi-round diffusion campaign, aiming to maximize the number of distinct users that are influenced. Leveraging the capability of bandit algorithms to effectively balance the objectives of exploration and exploitation, as well as the expressivity of neural networks, our study explores the application of neural bandit algorithms to the IM problem. We propose the framework IM-GNB (Influence Maximization with Graph Neural Bandits), where we provide an estimate of the users' probabilities of being influenced by influencers (also known as diffusion seeds). This initial estimate forms the basis for constructing both an exploitation graph and an exploration one. Subsequently, IM-GNB handles the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, by selecting seed nodes in real-time using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), in which the pre-estimated graphs are employed to refine the influencers' estimated rewards in each contextual setting. Through extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IM-GNB compared with other baseline methods, significantly improving the spread outcome of such diffusion campaigns, when the underlying network is unknown.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</description>

Abstract: Human values play a vital role as an analytical tool in social sciences, enabling the study of diverse dimensions within society as a whole and among individual communities. This paper addresses the limitations of traditional survey-based studies of human values by proposing a computational application of Schwartz's values framework to Reddit, a platform organized into distinct online communities. After ensuring the reliability of automated value extraction tools for Reddit content, we automatically annotate six million posts across 10,000 subreddits with Schwartz values. Our analysis unveils both previously recorded and novel insights into the values prevalent within various online communities. For instance, when examining subreddits with differing opinions on controversial topics, we discover higher universalism values in the Vegan subreddit compared to Carnivores. Additionally, our study of geographically specific subreddits highlights the correlation between traditional values and conservative U.S. states.</description>

      <title>Improving global awareness of linkset predictions using Cross-Attentive Modulation tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of multiple link prediction or graph generation techniques rely on the attention mechanism or on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which consist in leveraging node-level information exchanges in order to form proper link predictions. Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an ordered sequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: they are said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graph problems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predicted links, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can be the difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness, fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in dense areas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodes from the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalanced link predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used to condition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-aware computations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links. We will implement it on a few permutation invariant architectures, and showcase benchmarks that prove the merits of our work.</description>

      <title>Whose Emotions and Moral Sentiments Do Language Models Reflect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are known to represent the perspectives of some social groups better than others, which may impact their performance, especially on subjective tasks such as content moderation and hate speech detection. To explore how LMs represent different perspectives, existing research focused on positional alignment, i.e., how closely the models mimic the opinions and stances of different groups, e.g., liberals or conservatives. However, human communication also encompasses emotional and moral dimensions. We define the problem of affective alignment, which measures how LMs' emotional and moral tone represents those of different groups. By comparing the affect of responses generated by 36 LMs to the affect of Twitter messages, we observe significant misalignment of LMs with both ideological groups. This misalignment is larger than the partisan divide in the U.S. Even after steering the LMs towards specific ideological perspectives, the misalignment and liberal tendencies of the model persist, suggesting a systemic bias within LMs.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Language in Social Media Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of digital platforms on user behavior presents foundational challenges, including issues related to polarization, misinformation dynamics, and variation in news consumption. Comparative analyses across platforms and over different years can provide critical insights into these phenomena. This study investigates the linguistic characteristics of user comments over 34 years, focusing on their complexity and temporal shifts. Utilizing a dataset of approximately 300 million English comments from eight diverse platforms and topics, we examine the vocabulary size and linguistic richness of user communications and their evolution over time. Our findings reveal consistent patterns of complexity across social media platforms and topics, characterized by a nearly universal reduction in text length, diminished lexical richness, but decreased repetitiveness. Despite these trends, users consistently introduce new words into their comments at a nearly constant rate. This analysis underscores that platforms only partially influence the complexity of user comments. Instead, it reflects a broader, universal pattern of human behaviour, suggesting intrinsic linguistic tendencies of users when interacting online.</description>

      <title>Edge Classification on Graphs: New Directions in Topological Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of applying Graph machine learning (GML) to node/graph classification and link prediction. However, edge classification task that enjoys numerous real-world applications such as social network analysis and cybersecurity, has not seen significant advancement. To address this gap, our study pioneers a comprehensive approach to edge classification. We identify a novel `Topological Imbalance Issue', which arises from the skewed distribution of edges across different classes, affecting the local subgraph of each edge and harming the performance of edge classifications. Inspired by the recent studies in node classification that the performance discrepancy exists with varying local structural patterns, we aim to investigate if the performance discrepancy in topological imbalanced edge classification can also be mitigated by characterizing the local class distribution variance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Topological Entropy (TE), a novel topological-based metric that measures the topological imbalance for each edge. Our empirical studies confirm that TE effectively measures local class distribution variance, and indicate that prioritizing edges with high TE values can help address the issue of topological imbalance. Based on this, we develop two strategies - Topological Reweighting and TE Wedge-based Mixup - to focus training on (synthetic) edges based on their TEs. While topological reweighting directly manipulates training edge weights according to TE, our wedge-based mixup interpolates synthetic edges between high TE wedges. Ultimately, we integrate these strategies into a novel topological imbalance strategy for edge classification: TopoEdge. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed strategies on newly curated datasets and thus establish a new benchmark for (imbalanced) edge classification.</description>
