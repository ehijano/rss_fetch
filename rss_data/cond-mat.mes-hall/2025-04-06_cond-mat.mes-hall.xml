      <title>Quantum shockwave at the quasi-relativistic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the electromagnetic field travelling on resonance with the limiting velocity of the quasi-relativistic particle. We show that a strong longitudinal field leads to the quantum wave function singularity in the form of a shockwave, accompanied by strong energy dissipation. We show that the effect is particularly strong in the case of Dirac electrons in graphene due to the small effective mass. We discuss several experimental tests of these predictions.</description>

      <title>Formation of multiple quantum dots in ZnO heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, advancements in semiconductor manufacturing technology have enabled the formation of high-quality, high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in zinc oxide (ZnO) heterostructures, making the electrostatic formation of quantum dots possible. ZnO, with its low natural abundance of isotopes possessing nuclear spin and its direct bandgap, is considered a potentially suitable material for quantum bit applications. In this study, we achieve the formation of triple quantum dots and the realization of a few-electron state in ZnO heterostructure devices. We also confirm that by varying the gate voltage between the quantum dots, it is possible to control the interdot spacing. Additionally, we observe a tunneling phenomenon called a quantum cellular automata effect, where multiple electrons move simultaneously, which is not seen in single or double quantum dots, due to Coulomb interactions. Our results demonstrate that ZnO nanostructures have reached a level where they can function as controllable multiple quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Magnetocaloric Effect in a Rotating 2DEG under the Sagnac Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of the Sagnac effect on the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a rotating sample under the influence of a uniform magnetic field. We analyze how rotation and the distinction between effective mass ($m^*$) and gravitational mass ($m_G$) affect the energy levels and resulting thermodynamic properties. The results show that rotation modifies the energy levels, the application of a magnetic field leads to the formation of Landau levels further altered by rotation and gravitational mass, and thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, specific heat, free energy, entropy, magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect) exhibit a strong dependence on these parameters. In particular, the difference between $m^*$ and $m_G$ influences magnetization and the magnetocaloric effect, with negative rotations potentially inducing a cooling effect when these masses are distinct. We conclude that rotational effects and effective mass properties are crucial for understanding the thermodynamics of electronic systems under magnetic fields, with implications for thermal modulation in semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of charge defects near a graphene transistor using the Stark shift of fluorescent molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional crystals and their heterostructures unlock access to a class of photonic devices, bringing nanophotonics from the nanometer scale down to the atomic level where quantum effects are relevant. Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are central in quantum photonics as quantum markers linked to their electrostatic, thermal, magnetic, or dielectric environment. This aspect is exciting in two-dimensional (2D) crystals and their heterostructures, where the environment can be abruptly modified through vertical stacking or lateral structuring, such as moir\'e or nano-patterned gates. To further develop 2D-based quantum photonic devices, there is a need for quantum markers that are capable of integration into various device geometries, and that can be read out individually, non-destructively, and without additional electrodes. Here, we show how to optically detect charge carrier accumulation using sub-GHz linewidth single-photon emitters coupled to a graphene device. We employ the single molecule Stark effect, sensitive to the electric fields generated by charge puddles, such as those at the graphene edge. The same approach enables dynamic sensing of electronic noise, and we demonstrate the optical read-out of low-frequency white noise in a biased graphene device. The approach described here can be further exploited to explore charge dynamics in 2D heterostructures using quantum emitter markers.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion in non-Hermitian photonic graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have numerous potential applications, but the means used for their generation often lack crucial on-demand control. In this work, we present a mechanism of converting spin angular momentum (SAM) to OAM in a non-structured beam. The conversion occurs through spin-orbit coupling in a reconfigurable photonic honeycomb lattice with staggering implemented by electromagnetically-induced transparency in an atomic vapor cell. The spin-orbit coupling allows to outcouple the OAM signal from a particular band in a given valley determined by the chirality of light or the lattice staggering, providing a non-zero Berry curvature for generating OAM. The dependence of the output OAM on the chirality of the input beam is the first control knob. The staggering works as a second control knob, flipping the sign of OAM for the fixed chirality. The demonstrated conversion between SAM and OAM is important for optical communications. Our results can be extended to other implementations of paraxial photonic graphene.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit interactions, time-reversal symmetry, and spin selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin selective transport is usually associated with spin-orbit interactions. However, these interactions are invariant under time-reversal symmetry, and the Onsager relations and Bardarson's theorem imply that such interactions cannot yield spin selectivity for transport through a junction between two electronic reservoirs. Here, we review several ways to overcome this restriction, using a Zeeman magnetic field, the Aharonov-Bohm phase, time-dependent electric fields that generate time-dependent spin-orbit interactions, time-dependent transients, more than two terminals, leakage, and more than one level per ion on the junction. Our considerations focus on the transport of noninteracting electrons at low temperatures. A possible connection with the phenomenon of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is pointed out in one of the systems considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study high-order harmonic generation by optically driven one- and two-dimensional hydrogenlike atoms formed by Coulomb imurities in graphene. The time-dependent Dirac equations with Coulomb plus time-periodic monochromatic field potentials are solved for both cases. Such characteristics of the optical high harmonic generation, as average dipole moment and high harmonic generation spectra, are computed. A sketch for table-top experimental realization of the considered models is proposed.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of the surface states of rhombohedral graphite and its effects on the surface superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of rhombohedral graphite/graphene (RG) surface electronic states and its effects on superconductivity. We find that the RG surface bands have a non-vanishing quantum metric at the center of the drumhead region, and the local inequality between quantum metric and Berry curvature is an equality. Therefore, their quantum geometry is analogous to the lowest Landau level (LLL). The superconducting order parameters on the two surface orbitals of RG can be polarized by the surface potential, which boosts the superconducting transition in trilayer RG triggered by the displacement field. Analyzing the superfluid properties of multilayer RG, we make a connection with the topological heavy fermion model suggested to describe magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). It shows that RG fits in an unusual heavy-fermion picture with the flattest part of the surface bands carrying a nonzero supercurrent. These results may constrain the models constructed for the correlated phases of RG.</description>

      <title>Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the symmetry charge can be exchanged with the environment but remains conserved on average. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We validate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</description>

      <title>Perfect supercurrent diode efficiency in chiral nanotube-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE) describes superconducting systems where the magnitude of the superconducting-to-normal state switching current differs for positive and negative current bias. Despite the ubiquity of such diode effects in Josephson devices, the fundamental conditions to observe a diode effect in a Josephson junction and achieve perfect diode efficiency remain unclear. In this work, we analyze the supercurrent diode properties of a chiral nanotube-based Josephson junction within a Ginzburg-Landau theory. We find a diode effect and anomalous phase develops across the junction when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the tube despite the absence of spin-orbit interactions in the system. Unexpectedly, the SDE in the junction is independent of the anomalous phase. Alternatively, we determine a non-reciprocal persistent current that is protected by fluxoid quantization can activate SDE, even in the absence of higher-order pair tunneling processes. We show this new type of SDE can lead to, in principle, a perfect diode efficiency, highlighting how persistent currents can be used to engineer high efficiency supercurrent diodes.</description>

      <title>Modelling Interfacial Dynamics Using Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory: Dynamic Contact Angles and the Role of Local Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) is applied to analyse dynamic contact angles of droplets in order to assess its predictive capability regarding wetting phenomena at the microscopic scale and to evaluate its feasibility for multiscale modelling. Hydrodynamic DFT incorporates the influence of fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces into a hydrodynamic theory by including a thermodynamic model based on classical DFT for the chemical potential of inhomogeneous fluids. It simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations far away from interfaces, thus connecting microscopic molecular modelling and continuum fluid dynamics. In this work we use a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and the viscosity is obtained from generalised entropy scaling, a one-parameter model which takes microscopic information of the fluid and solid phase into account. Deterministic (noise-free) density and velocity profiles reveal wetting phenomena including different advancing and receding contact angles, the transition from equilibrium to steady state and the rolling motion of droplets. Compared to a viscosity model based on bulk values, generalised entropy scaling provides more accurate results, which stresses the importance of including microscopic information in the local viscosity model. Hydrodynamic DFT is transferable as it captures the influence of different external forces, wetting strengths and (molecular) solid roughness. For all results good quantitative agreement with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations is found, which emphasises that hydrodynamic DFT is able to predict wetting phenomena at the microscopic scale.</description>

Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system reveals different operational phases for the range of parameter regimes considered, such as a quantum heat engine. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-tuned randomness in inhomogeneous altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Modeling and computing many-body electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene with mechanical relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and compute solutions of a many-body model of the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. We model mechanical relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. Minimizers of the resulting functional are then input into a tight-binding model of twisted bilayer graphene, from which a single-particle continuum moir\'e-scale (Bistritzer-MacDonald-like) model is systematically derived. We then project this model together with a Coulomb electron-electron interaction term into the single-particle model's flat moir\'e bands. We numerically compute Hartree-Fock ground states of this model, comparing the relative energies of competing many-body ground states.</description>

Abstract: Little is known about the quantum effects of friction, and first-principles studies are virtually non-existent. In multilayer graphene, the order of the stacking of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers slide to change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer graphene by focusing on quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that layers have to overcome to slide with respect to each other. We evaluate the free energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent harmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations. We obtain a very large reduction of the barrier of more than 30%. Temperature effects are weaker, although high temperatures induce a significant reduction of the barrier as well. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing an individual charge fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot</title>

Abstract: Charge noise is a major obstacle to improved gate fidelities in silicon spin qubits. Numerous methods exist to mitigate charge noise, including improving device fabrication, dynamical decoupling, and real-time parameter estimation. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of techniques to mitigate charge noise in semiconductor quantum dots by controlling the noise sources themselves. Using two different classical feedback methods, we stabilize an individual charged two-level fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot by exploiting sensitive gate-voltage dependence of the switching times. These control methods reduce the low-frequency component of the noise power spectrum by an order of magnitude. These techniques also enable stabilizing the fluctuator in either of its states. In the future, such techniques may enable improved coherence times in quantum-dot spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Dephasing of planar Ge hole spin qubits due to 1/$\textit{f}$ charge noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hole spin qubits in Ge, investigated for all-electrical spin manipulation because of its large spin-orbit coupling, are exposed to charge noise leading to decoherence. Here we construct a model of $1/f$ noise from individual fluctuators and determine the dephasing time $T_2^*$ as a function of qubit properties. $T_2^*$ decreases with increasing magnetic field and is an order of magnitude longer for out-of-plane than for in-plane fields for the same Zeeman energy. $T_2^*$ shows little variation as a function of the top gate field and is a complex function of the dot radius. Our results should help experiments to enhance coherence in hole qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>FeGe as a building block for the kagome 1:1, 1:6:6, and 1:3:5 families: hidden d-orbital decoupling of flat band sectors, effective models and interaction Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure and interactions of kagome materials, such as the 1:1 (FeGe) and 1:6:6 (MgFe6Ge6) classes, are complicated and involve many orbitals and bands around the Fermi level. Current theoretical models treat the systems in an $s$-orbital kagome representation, unsuited and incorrect both quantitatively and qualitatively to the material realities. In this work, we lay the basis of a faithful framework of the electronic model for this large class of materials. We show that the complicated ``spaghetti" of electronic bands near the Fermi level can be decomposed into three groups of Fe d orbitals coupled to specific Ge orbitals via symmetry and chemical analysis. Such a decomposition allows for a clear analytical understanding (leading to different results than the simple s-orbital kagome models) of the flat bands in the system based on the S-matrix formalism of generalized bipartite lattices. Our three minimal Hamiltonians can reproduce the quasiflat bands, van Hove singularities, topology, and Dirac points close to the Fermi level, which we prove by extensive ab initio studies. We also obtain the interacting Hamiltonian for the d orbitals in FeGe using the constraint random phase approximation (cRPA) method, which faithfully describes the antiferromagnetic phase. We then use FeGe as a fundamental LEGO-like building block for a large family of 1:6:6 kagome materials, which can be obtained by doubling and perturbing the FeGe Hamiltonian. We apply the model to its kagome siblings FeSn and CoSn, and also MgFe6Ge6. We further extend the formalism developed for the 1:1 family to the 1:3:5 family AB3Z5 (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Cr, V, Ti; Z = Sb, Bi), demonstrating the broad applicability of the LEGO-like building block approach. Our work serves as the first complete framework for the study of the interacting phase diagram of kagome compounds.</description>

      <title>A Novel Liquid-Liquid Interface Deposition Method for the Production of Thin Films and van der Waals Heterostructures of Two-Dimensional Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin films and van der Waals heterostructures derived from two-dimensional solids offer enormous potential for a broad range of novel, energy efficient devices, however, their use is currently hampered by slow, labor-intensive fabrication methods often employing hazardous chemicals. We demonstrate a novel technique for rapid, low-cost and environmentally-friendly production of ultra-thin films and van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional solids from aqueous surfactant-stabilized suspensions, which we term `Liquid Interface Deposition'. Films are produced by the transfer of platelets of two-dimensional materials assembled at the interface between two immiscible liquids (water and dicholoromethane), at which surfactants which stabilize the two-dimensional materials in the aqueous phase are `stripped' from the platelets due to preferential partitioning of the surfactant to the non-aqeuous phase. The approach is generic to two-dimensional materials which can be stabilized in aqueous suspension by a surfactant and the resulting films can then be transferred to an arbitrary substrate by a range of approaches. The generic applicability of this technique is demonstrated through production of thin films on a variety of substrates, deposition of transparent, highly conductive, graphene films with conductivities between $7.7 \times 10^{3} - 1.26\times 10^{5}~\textrm{S m}^{-1}$ and transmittances of 55-75%, and by the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and few-layer graphene.</description>

      <title>The BPHZL renormalization of a planar quantum electrodynamics up to 2-loops and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>
