      <title>Nuclear $\beta^{-}$-decay with statistical de-excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate description of nuclear $\beta^{-}$-decay has far-reaching consequences for applications spanning nuclear reactors to the creation of heavy elements in astrophysical environments. We present the nuclear particle spectra associated with the $\beta$-decay of neutron-rich nuclei calculated with the well benchmarked coupled Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation and Hauser-Feshbach (QRPA+HF) model. This approach begins with the population of the daughter nucleus via semi-microscopic Gamow-Teller or First-Forbidden strength distributions (QRPA) and follows the statistical de-excitation (HF) until the initial available excitation energy is exhausted. At each stage of de-excitation the emission by neutrons and $\gamma$-rays is considered obeying quantum mechanical selection rules. For completeness we also provide parsed Auger and Internal Conversion (IC) electron spectra from Evaluated Nuclear Data Files (ENDF). Our results are tabulated and provided in parsable ASCII formatted tables that are suitable for inclusion in various applications.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-State Independent Relations in Rapidly Rotating Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 22 hadronic and 100 hybrid equations of state (EoSs) that allow for heavy baryons and deconfined quark matter at high densities, aiming to establish quasi-universal relations for both slowly and rapidly rotating neutron stars. All EoSs are consistent with current observational constraints, including NICER and GW170817. Our results confirm that the I-Love-Q and I-C-Q relations remain approximately EoS-insensitive across this broad EoS set, with deviations typically within 10\% for hadronic stars and up to 20\% for those with complex core compositions. These relations are extended to include low-mass neutron stars such as HESS J1731-347, and to stars with general core compositions--nucleonic, hyperonic (full baryon octet), and quark matter. The analysis underscores both the robustness and the limitations of universal relations when applied to compact stars with exotic degrees of freedom and rapid rotation.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$-deuteron momentum correlation functions incorporating deuteron breakup contributions in Faddeev formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of the deuteron breakup are estimated for the $\Lambda$-deuteron momentum correlation function. Faddeev amplitudes in calculating low-energy $\Lambda$-deuteron scattering can provide not only the elastic scattering part but also breakup wave functions in the incident and the rearrangement channels. Calculations are carried out using nucleon-nucleon (NN) and hyperon-nucleon (YN) interactions parametrized in chiral effective field theory. The effects of the breakup in the incident channel are found to be marginally insignificant. Those of the rearrangement channel are not negligible, but not large when the source radius is larger than 2.5 fm. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to have the information on the magnitude of these effects in analyzing the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Variational Theory and Parquet Diagrams for Nuclear Systems: A Comprehensive Study of Neutron Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To deal with the problem of realistic nuclear interactions we have combined techniques of the Jastrow-Feenberg variational method and the local parquet-diagram theory. In the language of diagrammatic perturbation theory, ``commutator diagrams'' can be identified with non-parquet diagrams. We examine the physical processes described by these terms and include the relevant diagrams in a way that is suggested by the Jastrow-Feenberg approach. We show that the corrections from non-parquet contributions are, at short distances, larger than all other many-body effects.
  We examine here neutron matter as a prototype of systems with state-dependent interactions. Calculations are carried out for neutrons interacting via the so-called $v_8$ version of four popular interactions. We determine the structure and effective interactions and apply the method to the calculation of the energetics, structure and dynamic properties such as the single-particle self-energy and the dynamic response functions as well as BCS pairing in both singlet and triplet states. We find that many-body correlations lead to a strong reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, and, therefore, to a suppression of the $^3P_2$ and $^3P_2$-$^3F_2$ gaps. We also find pairing in $^3P_0$ states; the strength of the pairing gap depends sensitively on the potential model employed.</description>

      <title>Particle species dependence of elliptic flow fluctuations in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies in a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuations of elliptic flow (\vtwo) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions offer a powerful tool to probe the collective behavior and transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The dependence of these fluctuations on particle species further sheds light on the hadronization mechanism. At LHC energies, the ALICE experiment has measured $v_2$ fluctuations for charged pions, kaons, and (anti-)protons via the ratio of \vtwo measured with respect to the spectator plane (\vtwosp) and from the four-particle cumulants (\vtwofour). However, the observed dependencies on transverse momentum and particle type remain not fully understood. In this study, we perform a phenomenological investigation using a multiphase transport (AMPT) model, which allows us to trace the full evolution of flow fluctuations intertwined with the quark coalescence. The results qualitatively reproduce the ALICE measurements and offer deeper insights into the transport dynamics and hadronization of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclear Matter To Dense Compact-Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An argument is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be understood in terms of the mechanism referred to as ``pseudo-conformal sound speed" in dense compact-star matter, $v_{\rm pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$. Both pros and cons are presented using an effective field theory anchored on renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's highly successful EFT $\chi$EFT$_\pi$ with the pion field only (in nuclear medium) by implementing heavy-meson degrees of freedom. Both hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter involving the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ ($f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity" is brought in via the topological structure of the nucleon, i.e., skyrmion considered to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The new inputs for the argumentation are the large N limit of the Grassmanian model for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry.</description>

      <title>Extraction of ground-state nuclear deformations from ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions: Nuclear structure physics context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has recently been used to characterize nuclear collective states. In this paper, we assess the foundations of the shape-imaging technique employed in these studies. We conclude that, on the whole, the discussion regarding low-energy nuclear physics is confusing and the suggested impact on nuclear structure research is overstated. Conversely, efforts to incorporate existing knowledge on nuclear shapes into analysis pipelines can be beneficial for benchmarking tools and calibrating models used to extract information from ultra-relativistic heavy ion experiments.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Radially Excited Charmonia in The Light Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11564v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the properties of excited charmonia is important to clarify its internal structure. In this paper, we present the mass spectra (MS) and decay constants (DC) for charmonia up to 3S states calculated by means of the light-front quark model based on a variational approach. In particular, we consider the QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian, which includes both confinement (linear and screened) and Coulomb-like potentials. Furthermore, since the existence of the nature of heavy quark symmetry, we treat hyperfine interactions perturbatively. We developed the harmonic oscillator expansion method to approximate the wave function (WF) for excited states. We found that the results of our theoretical calculations, using screened potentials rather than linear ones, are in good agreement with experimental data. By looking at the mass and decay constant result, we found that our result on the {\psi}(3S) state matched the properties of the {\psi}(4040) resonance.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent $M1$ radiative transitions of excited $B_c$ and heavy quarkonia with different polarizations in the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13172v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the properties of pseudoscalar and vector charmonia, bottomonia, and $B_c$ mesons using the light-front quark model, focusing on the $M1$ radiative transition. For that purpose, we conduct a variational analysis with a QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian, employing a trial wave function expanded in the harmonic oscillator basis functions up to the $3S$ state. We fit the model parameters to mass spectra and decay constants, obtaining reasonable agreement with experimental data and correctly reflecting the hierarchy of mass spectra and decay constants. In analyzing the $M1$ radiative transition, we consider both good ($\mu=+$) and transverse ($\mu={\perp}$) current components with both longitudinal $(h=0)$ and transverse $(h=\pm1)$ polarizations, demonstrating that the results from both components of currents and polarizations are identical. Self-consistency is achieved by substituting $M$ with $M_0$ when computing the operators for decay constants and radiative transitions. We also find that the difference between longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the observables may quantify the anisotropy of the model wave function. Our results on radiative transitions align reasonably well with experimental data, lattice QCD, and theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we also provide predictions for $B_c$ mesons that can be tested in experiments.</description>

      <title>Soft background fields at next-to-leading power in transverse momentum dependent SIDIS with jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a factorization formula for the $e + h \rightarrow e + \text{jet} + X$ cross section at small transverse momenta up to next-to-leading power (NLP), derived using the background field method (BFM) with explicit inclusion of soft modes. We discuss the relation between soft modes and overlap subtractions at NLP, showing that the inclusion of soft modes enables a definition of twist-3 operators with properly subtracted rapidity and endpoint divergences. We also derive the effective current operator at NLP and identify additional structures compared to previous approaches based on soft-collinear effective theory and the BFM without soft modes. Nevertheless, for the hadronic tensor, we find agreement at the perturbative order that we are working at, and identify a condition that needs to be satisfied for this agreement to extend to higher orders. Furthermore, we construct the most general form factors for this process, taking into account the polarization of the initial states. These involve perturbatively-calculable jet functions, opening a path to precise determinations of twist-3 hadronic distributions. Finally, our formalism is illustrated with phenomenological results for a specific azimuthal asymmetry, whose leading-logarithmic contribution depends solely on a twist-3 hadronic distribution and a twist-2 jet function.</description>

      <title>Scattering off unstable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstable states that live long enough may appear as in(out)going particles in scattering experiments. Yet, the standard QFT approach strictly applies only to fully stable asymptotic states. This is evident when scattering involving unstable particles develops a $t$-channel singularity at specific angles. We employ a finite-time formalism leading to analytic results without the singularity (even in the infinite-time limit), thus solving the problem at a fundamental level. In turn, the approach also justifies treating long-lived particles, like weakly decaying pions, as stable during strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $M1$ radiative transitions between light vector $\mathcal{V}$ and pseudoscalar $\mathcal{P}$ mesons in the 1S and 2S states in the light-front quark model. To this end, we use the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) obtained from the QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian that includes smeared spin-spin interactions, where a few harmonic oscillator basis functions were employed as trial wave functions. The results, including their couplings and widths, obtained from LFWFs with different trial wave functions are compared with the available experimental data and other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Complex Absorbing Potential Green's Function Methods for Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex absorbing potential (CAP) formalism has been successfully employed in various wavefunction-based methods to study electronic resonance states. In contrast, Green's function-based methods are widely used to compute ionization potentials and electron affinities but have seen limited application to resonances. We integrate the CAP formalism within the $GW$ approximation, enabling the description of electronic resonances in a Green's function framework. This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \ce{N2^-}, \ce{CO^-}, \ce{CO_2^-}, \ce{C2H2-}, \ce{C2H4-}, and \ce{CH2O-}. It offers a fast and practical route to approximate both the lifetimes and positions of resonance states, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art wavefunction-based methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-precision experiment in search of the predicted Efimov state in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at 7.458 MeV excitation energy was performed. Using a state-of-the-art detector system and novel analysis techniques, it was possible to observe the Efimov state at the predicted energy level above the 3$\alpha$ threshold with much better sensitivity in the $^{12} \mathrm{C}$ excitation energy spectrum compared to the existing data. The mutual $^{8} \mathrm{Be}$ resonance (91.84 keV) condition filters out a total of 21 probable Efimov state events around 7.458 MeV. With 2$\sigma$ confidence, it gives an upper limit of 0.014$\%$ for the Efimov state $\alpha$-decay width relative to that of the Hoyle state, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than the latest upper limit found in the literature. This observation was supported by a new penetrability calculation assuming a relatively extended structure of the Efimov state compared to the Hoyle state. The effect of the Efimov state was also explored in a nuclear astrophysical scenario, where the triple-$\alpha$ reaction rate, including both the Hoyle state and the Efimov state, was found to be larger than the allowed limit, while the temperature dependence of the combined rate was found to be compatible with the helium shell flash criterion of the AGB stars.</description>

      <title>Rotational susceptibility of a hot and dense hadronic matter: A possible probe of QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation and the consequent angular momentum fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The rotational susceptibilities ($\chi_{\rm \omega}$, $\chi^{2}_{\rm \omega}$, etc.), which quantify how much the system responds to a small angular velocity, are estimated for the first time, considering that these can be valuable indicators of the QCD phase transition. The higher-order rotational susceptibilities and their ratios are estimated in the presence and absence of baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{\rm B}$) in the system. The effect of particle spin ($s$) and rotational chemical potential ($\omega$) on the fluctuation of the angular momentum is studied. To consider a more realistic scenario, the effect of interactions between hadrons is taken into account by considering van der Waals-like interactions, which include both attractive and repulsive interactions. A phase transition, absent in an ideal hadron gas model, can be observed in an interacting hadron gas model.</description>

      <title>New Molecular Dynamics Methods for Simulating Neutron Star Crusts with Superfluid Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid vortices in neutron star crusts are thought to be pinned to the lattice of nuclei in the crust. The unpinning of superfluid vortices in spin glitches therefore motivates us to study the vortex-crust interaction explicitly with molecular dynamics. In this work, we present a new molecular dynamics methods to characterize the response of the crust to a rigid vortex. When vortex pinning forces and nearest neighbor Coulomb forces are comparable, we observe a qualitatively new phenomena of lattice entrainment with implications for the elastic evolution of the crust.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of vector mesons in heavy-ion collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a brief review on the spin alignment induced by the strong field and the shear-stress tensor. In experiments, a significant positive deviation from 1/3 is observed for the $\phi$ meson, which can be explained by the anisotropy of the strong field fluctuation in the meson's rest frame, while the anisotropy is mainly a consequence of the motion of meson relative to the quark-gluon plasma. On the other hand, the shear-induced spin alignment is of the order $10^{-4}\sim10^{-5}$ if the magnitude of thermal shear tensor is $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Laser spectroscopy and CP-violation sensitivity of actinium monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apparent invariance of the strong nuclear force under combined charge conjugation and parity (CP) remains an open question in modern physics. Precision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent constraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric dipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons, and nuclei. Radioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such searches, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond technical reach. Here we report the first production and spectroscopic study of a gas-phase actinium molecule, $^{227}$AcF. We observe the predicted strongest electronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient readout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform electronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for $^{227}$AcF to determine its sensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic, near-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current constraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by three orders of magnitude. Our results thus highlight the potential of $^{227}$AcF for exceptionally sensitive searches of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Particle Monopole Form Factors with Ab Initio No-Core Shell Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear many-body approaches with modern nuclear forces are challenged by the recent experimental measurement of the monopole form factor of the $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition in the $\alpha$ particle [Kegel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 152502 (2023)]. We investigate the elastic and inelastic $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition form factors using the ab initio no-core shell model (NCSM). We observe a good convergence of both form factors with respect to the basis size employing the Daejeon16 nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction. Our NCSM results are very close to the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonic calculations using $NN$ plus three-nucleon interactions based on the chiral effective field theory which take into account the continuum effects via the Lorentz integral transform. The significant difference between the ab initio results with various modern nuclear interactions and of some of them with the recent experimental data provides motivations for deeper investigation of this observable.</description>

      <title>Triple-charmed Hadron from Coalescence in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Unlike proton-proton collisions, nuclear collisions produce both deconfined matter and abundant charm quark pairs, which can coalesce to form the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon, thereby significantly enhancing its production. We employ the Langevin model and the Instantaneous Coalescence Model (LICM), coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, to study charm quark diffusion and coalescence into the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon in expanding QCD matter. The production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ is governed by the charm quark densities and the in-medium wavefunctions of the $\Omega_{ccc}$, which determines the coalescence probability for the three charm quarks. We calculate the $\Omega_{ccc}$ production with realistic charm diffusions and different in-medium wave functions of $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon. We find that the production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon is sensitive to these factors, which aids in understanding its properties in the hot QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>

Abstract: This article surveys our present understanding of the internal structure of the fully developed quark-gluon plasma at temperatures outside the crossover region. The theoretical part of the review covers perturbative and nonperturbative approaches to quark-gluon plasma structure, in particular, hard-thermal loop effective theory, lattice QCD and the functional renormalization group. The phenomenological part of the review scrutinizes the information that has been derived from bulk observables and hard probes in relativistic heavy ion collisions in terms of how it informs our knowledge about the structure of the quark-gluon plasma. The final section lists possible avenues for future progress.</description>

      <title>On the local thermodynamic relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate, by providing two specific examples, that the local differential thermodynamic relations used as educated guesses in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin, do not hold even at global thermodynamic equilibrium. We show, by using a rigorous quantum statistical method, that for massless free fermions and massive free fermions with rotation and acceleration at global thermodynamic equilibrium, the derivative of the pressure function with respect to the spin potential differs from the spin density and acquires a correction of the same order. Such correction cannot be eliminated by any redefinition of the entropy current, a so-called entropy-gauge transformation. Therefore, for an accurate determination of the constitutive relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, the traditional method of assuming differential thermodynamic relations is not appropriate.</description>

      <title>Let there be neutrons! Hadronic photoproduction from a large flux of high-energy photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photohadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Being closely connected to the origin of the nucleon mass, the gravitational form factors of the nucleon have attracted significant attention in recent years. We present the first model-independent determinations of the gravitational form factors of the pion and nucleon at the physical pion mass, using a data-driven dispersive approach. The so-called "last global unknown property" of the nucleon, the $D$-term, is determined to be $-3.38^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$. The root mean square radius of the scalar trace density inside the nucleon is determined to be $(0.97 \pm0.03)~\text{fm}$. Notably, this value is larger than the proton charge radius, suggesting a modern structural view of the nucleon where gluons, responsible for most of the nucleon mass, are distributed over a larger spatial region than quarks, which dominate the charge distribution, indicating that the radius of the trace density may be regarded as a confinement radius. We also predict the nucleon angular momentum and mechanical radii, providing further insights into the intricate internal structure of the nucleon.</description>

Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous, anisotropically scattering massless gas. Utilizing a BKW-like trial solution, we cast the Boltzmann equation into a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments, based on which the analytical solution is derived. One remarkable feature of our analytical solution lies in the nontrivial scattering angle dependence. We also show that this analytical solution admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution as long as the parameters are physically feasible. Furthermore, a clear correspondence between our solution and the BKW solution pertaining to nonrelativistic Maxwell molecules is established, thereby clarifying the non-existence of a BKW-type solution in the relativistic domain for massive particles.</description>

Abstract: Extensive gamma-ray spectroscopy of very neutron-rich nuclei of isotopes between the Ni and Sn isotopic chains was facilitated by the high luminosity LH2 target system, MINOS. Results show a persistence of deformation when going beyond the N = 60 threshold of the transition between spherical to deformed ground states at N &lt; 60 and N &gt; 60, respectively. Close to 78Ni, a more detailed image of the N &gt; 50 Zn isotopes shows an erosion of the N = 50 shell closure, with core-breaking effects needed from theoretical models to replicate observation. As well as the experimental results indicating collective effects, the projected generator coordinate method is discussed in detail within the context of the neutron-rich Ge isotopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Spin-down Glitch in PSR J1835$-$1106</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of a spin-down glitch with a fractional frequency change of $\Delta\nu/\nu=-3.46(6)\times10^{-9}$ in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1835$-$1106 at MJD 55813, based on timing observations collected with the Nanshan 26-m and Parkes 64-m radio telescopes from January 2000 to July 2022. A comparison of the average pulse profiles within $\pm300$ d of the event reveals no significant morphological changes. We also estimate the angular velocity lag between the normal and superfluid components at the time of the glitch, showing that one of the superfluid glitch models is incompatible with PSR J1835$-$1106 due to its insufficient spin-down rate and angular velocity lag. The wind braking scenario offers a viable alternative, consistent with the observed spin-down behavior, glitch amplitude, and post-glitch recovery. High-cadence, high-sensitivity monitoring of similar events is essential to distinguish between internal (superfluid) and external (wind-related) glitch mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole polarizability constraints on neutron skin and symmetry energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the experimental knowledge on the dipole polarizability (DP) of nuclei and its relation to the neutron skin thickness and properties of the neutron-rich matter equation of state (EOS). The discussion focuses on recent experiments using relativistic Coulomb excitation in inelastic proton scattering at extreme forward angles covering a mass range from $^{40}$Ca to $^{208}$Pb. Constraints on the neutron skins and the density dependence of the symmetry energy are derived from systematic comparison to calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio methods utilizing interactions derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT). The results consistently favor a soft EOS around or slightly below the saturation point. An outlook is given on possible improvements of the precision achievable in stable nuclei and studies of exotic neutron-rich unstable nuclei with upcoming experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>

      <title>Measurement of string tension and initial temperature from transverse momentum spectra of heavy quarkonia in proton-proton collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The string tension ($\kappa$) in the Schwinger mechanism and the effective temperature ($T$) in Bose-Einstein statistics are extracted from the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of heavy quarkonia produced in proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Here, $T$ derived from the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra also represents the initial temperature of the collision system, as transverse flow has not yet formed when heavy quarkonia are produced. The related parameters ($\kappa$ and $T$) are obtained by fitting the experimental $p_T$ spectra of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n=1$, 2, and 3) within various rapidity intervals, produced in p+p collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13$ and 8 TeV, as measured by the LHCb Collaboration. It is found that the multi-component distribution structured within the framework of the Schwinger mechanism or Bose-Einstein statistics can effectively describe the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra in small collision systems. With decreasing rapidity in the forward region, both $\kappa$ and $T$ increase, indicating a directly proportional relationship between them. Based on $\kappa$, the average minimum strong force radius of participant quarks is determined.</description>

      <title>Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon that deepens the analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>The nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Towards a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states are both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>

      <title>Direct proton transfer on $^{46}$Ar supports the presence of a charge density bubble linked to a novel nuclear structure below $^{48}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $^{46}$Ar($^3$He,d)$^{47}$K reaction was performed in inverse kinematics using a radioactive $^{46}$Ar beam produced by the SPIRAL1 facility at GANIL and a cryogenic $^{3}$He target. The AGATA-MUGAST-VAMOS setup allowed the coincident measurement of the $\gamma$ rays, deuterons and recoiling $^{47}$K isotopes produced by the reaction. The relative cross sections towards the proton-addition states in $^{47}$K point towards a depletion of the $\pi s_{1/2}$ shell. The experimental findings are in good agreement with ab initio calculations, which predict that $^{46}$Ar exhibits a charge density bubble associated with a pronounced proton closed-shell character.</description>
