      <title>Topological Peierls instabilities in more than one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A periodic lattice distortion that reduces the translational symmetry folds electron bands into a reduced Brillouin zone, leading to band mixing and a tendency to gap formation, as in the Peierls transition in one-dimensional systems. However, in higher dimensions, the resulting phase can present topological obstructions preventing a complete gap opening. We discuss two different mechanisms for such obstructions, emergent Weyl nodes and symmetry protected band crossings. Based on density-functional calculations, we show these mechanisms are at play in trigonal PtBi$_2$.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Based Circuit Model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Insight into magnetocaloric properties of Mn2Nb molecular magnet by relaxation calorimetry: A comprehensive case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetocaloric effect in [Nb$^\mathrm{IV}${($\mu$-CN)$_4$Mn$^\mathrm{II}$(H$_2$O)$_2$]}$_2\cdot$4H$_2$O]$_n$ molecular magnet is reported. The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal I4/m space group. It exhibits a phase transition to a long-range ferrimagnetically ordered state at $T_\mathrm{c}$ = 47.0(2) K. In order to calculate magnetocaloric properties relaxation calorimetry measurements are performed and a self-consistent scheme based on the magnetic entropy counting for the baseline determination is developed. The molecular field model is used to simulate the temperature and field dependence of the magnetic entropy change. The exchange coupling constant between the Mn$^\mathrm{II}$ and Nb$^\mathrm{IV}$ ions is estimated to be equal to -10.26 K. At the lowest temperatures and for the lowest applied field change values the inverse magnetocaloric effect is revealed, which seems to be characteristic for systems with antiferromagnetic coupling. The temperature dependence of exponent $n$ quantifying the field dependence of $\Delta S_\mathrm{M}$ is calculated on the basis of the experimental results and within the mean-field model. Its predicting power for the universality class of the critical behavior is discussed. Finally, the studied compound is employed as the working substance in the two most natural refrigeration cycles, i.e. the Brayton cycle and the Ericsson cycle, to assess its cooling effectiveness. A cascade system is suggested for the most efficient cooling performance.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Saddletronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low energy valleys in the band structure of 2d materials represent a potential route to the ultrafast writing of information in quantum matter by laser light, with excited charge at the K or K$^\ast$ valleys representing the fundamental states of 1 and 0. Here we demonstrate that a second electronic feature, the saddle point, is endowed with lightwave control over information states. Linearly polarized light is shown to excite 2 of the 3 inequivalent M point saddles in graphene, generating three possible excited configurations, with which of these are realised determined by the polarization vector direction. We show that saddle excitation is highly robust, with "saddle polarized" states created both in the sub-cycle strong field regime and the long time limit of extended multi-cycle pulses. Our findings, applicable to other members of the graphene family and Xenes such as stanene, point towards a rich and ultrafast light based manipulation of matter based on the saddle point.</description>

      <title>The role of the effective mass in two-dimensional Dirac electric quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a different effective mass inside and outside an electric quantum dot on in its energy spectrum. Depending on the different values we give to the mass, we have found quite different spectra. Specifically, when the mass is positive but lighter inside the dot than outside it, the spectrum increases and splits into two types of states separated by a gap. Conversely, if the mass inside the quantum dot is heavier than the mass outside, the spectrum has fewer states and needs stronger fields in order to confine states. Finally, the case of inverted mass (ie, negative mass inside the quantum dot and positive outside it or vice versa) gives rise to a new spectral curve of edge states. All these cases have been analyzed in detail along this paper.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-equilibrium in ultrafast irradiation of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This proceeding discusses nonequilibrium effects in matter exposed to XUV/X-ray irradiation. When ultrashort, intense XUV/X-ray pulses interact with materials, they trigger a complex sequence of processes, including electronic excitation, nonequilibrium electron kinetics, energy exchange with the atomic system, electronic thermalization, and subsequent atomic dynamics. These effects were investigated using XTANT-3, a hybrid simulation tool that simultaneously models all relevant dynamics. XTANT-3 integrates (a) a Monte Carlo transport method for photon absorption and fast electron kinetics, (b) the Boltzmann equation for nonequilibrium slow electron dynamics, (c) a transferable tight-binding approach for electronic structure evolution and interatomic potential modeling, and (d) molecular dynamics for atomic system response. This approach enables a detailed study of nonequilibrium effects in each subsystem and their interplay with nonthermal damage, where electronic excitation alters the interatomic potential. Methods of quantifying the nonequilibrium in the electronic and atomic subsystems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometry effect of the dynamical quantum phase transitions at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) probe the nonequilibrium evolution of quantum systems, unveiling their geometric and topological characteristics. In this study, we introduce the concepts of parallel quench and dynamic geometrical order parameter (DGOP) for non-band models, where these quantities capture the geometric shifts associated with DQPTs. At zero temperature, the DGOP corresponds to the Pancharatnam geometric phase, while at finite temperatures, it extends to the interferometric geometric phase. We further generalize the dynamic topological order parameter (DTOP) to finite-temperature band models, examining its behavior in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our analysis shows that thermal fluctuations and boundary effects at finite temperatures disrupt the quantization of the DTOP, yet it retains signatures of topological transitions. These findings deepen the understanding of geometric and topological properties in quantum dynamics, illuminating DQPTs across both non-band and band frameworks.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of torques from orbital Rashba textures: the case of Co/Al interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of orbitronics, the rising of the orbital angular momentum generated at light metal interfaces from orbital textures via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects nowadays represent extraordinary alternatives to the usual heavy-metal spin-based materials. In the light of very recent experimental results [\textcolor{blue}{S. Krishnia \textit{et al.}, Nanoletters 2023, 23, 6785}], starting from state-of-the-art density functional theory simulations, we provide theoretical insights into the emergence of very strong orbital torques at the Co/Al interface location a strong orbital Rashba texture. By using linear response theory, we calculate the exerted orbital torque amplitudes, mainly of field-like intraband character, acting onto the ultrathin Co. Moreover, we show that an insertion of a single atomic plane of Pt between Co and Al is enough to suppress the effect which questions about the anatomy of the torque action clearly behaving differently than in the standard way. This work opens new routes to the engineering of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>
