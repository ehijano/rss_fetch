      <title>Encapsulation-induced Alignment in Endofullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for creating endofullerenes have been steadily improving since their discovery, allowing for new types of endofullerenes to be created in larger numbers. When a molecule is trapped in a fullerene, the fullerene creates a harmonic trapping potential that leaves most of the fundamental properties of the internal molecule intact. The fullerene cage does create a preferred axis for the internal molecule, which we refer to as the encapsulation-induced alignment of the molecule. We explore the alignment of AlF and N2 inside of C60 by first computing the interaction between the internal molecule and the fullerene cage using ab initio electronic structure methods. Our results show that the internal molecules are found to be strongly aligned despite finding that all the calculated spectroscopic constants are relatively unaffected by the fullerene cage.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Pristine Molecular Orbitals from Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Images via Artificial Intelligence Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular orbital (MO) is one of the most fundamental concepts for molecules, relating to all branches of chemistry, while scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been widely recognized for its potential to measure the spatial distribution of MOs. However, the precise characterization of MO with high resolution in real space is a long-standing challenge owing to the inevitable interference of high-angular-momentum contributions from functionalized tips in STM. Here, leveraging advances in artificial intelligence for image recognition, we establish a physics-driven deep-learning network, named STM-Net, to reconstruct MOs from high-resolution STM images with a functionalized tip, taking advantage of the separable characteristics of different angular momentum contributions. We demonstrate that STM-Net can be directly applied to a variety of experimental observations, successfully reconstructing pristine MO features for molecules under diverse conditions. Moreover, STM-Net can adapt to various states of the functionalized tip and the substrate, illustrating the broad applicability of our physics-driven framework. These results pave the way for accurate characterization of MO with high resolution, potentially leading to new insights and applications for this fundamental concept in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Self-Refinement of Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo via Non-Orthogonal Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For optimal accuracy, auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) requires trial states consisting of multiple Slater determinants. We develop an efficient algorithm to select the determinants from an AFQMC random walk eliminating the need for other methods. When determinants contribute significantly to the non-orthogonal configuration interaction energy, we include them in the trial state. These refined trial wave functions significantly reduce the phaseless bias and sampling variance of the local energy estimator. With 100 to 200 determinants, we lower the error of AFQMC by up to a factor of 10 for second row elements that are not accurately described with a Hartree-Fock trial wave function. For the HEAT set, we improve the average error to within the chemical accuracy. For benzene, the largest studied system, we reduce AFQMC error by 80% with 214 Slater determinants and find a 10-fold increase of the time to solution. We show that the remaining error of the method prevails in systems with static correlation or strong spin contamination.</description>

      <title>Manipulating nonadiabatic dynamics by plasmonic nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, plasmonic nanocavities have emerged as powerful tools for controlling and enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. This study explores the role of plasmonic nanocavities in manipulating nonadiabatic dynamics, particularly in systems where fast electronic transitions are crucial. By coupling molecular states to the plasmonic resonances of metallic nanocavities, we demonstrate that the local electromagnetic fields generated by plasmons can significantly influence the rates and pathways of nonadiabatic transitions, including electron transfer and excitation relaxation processes. Using the Floquet quantum master equation (FQME) and Floquet surface hopping (FSH) methods that we previously developed, we find that plasmonic nanocavities can enhance nonadiabatic effects by tuning the plasmonic coupling strength, the molecule-metal interaction strength, and the material properties. These approaches offer a new perspective for predicting molecular dynamics in ultrafast processes. Our findings pave the way for designing novel plasmonic devices capable of controlling electron and energy transfer in chemical reactions, optoelectronic applications, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Universal Catalyst Design Framework for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis Facilitated by Local Atomic Environment Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a universal and precise design framework is crucial to search high-performance catalysts, but it remains a giant challenge due to the diverse structures and sites across various types of catalysts. To address this challenge, herein, we developed a novel framework by the refined local atomic environment descriptors (i.e., weighted Atomic Center Symmetry Function, wACSF) combined with machine learning (ML), microkinetic modeling, and computational high-throughput screening. This framework is successfully integrated into the Digital Catalysis Database (DigCat), enabling efficient screening for 2e- water oxidation reaction (2e- WOR) catalysts across four material categories (i.e., metal alloys, metal oxides and perovskites, and single-atom catalysts) within a ML model. The proposed wACSF descriptors integrating both geometric and chemical features are proven effective in predicting the adsorption free energies with ML. Excitingly, based on the wACSF descriptors, the ML models accurately predict the adsorption free energies of hydroxyl ({\Delta}GOH*) and oxygen ({\Delta}GO*) for such a wide range of catalysts, achieving R2 values of 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Through density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, a universal 2e- WOR microkinetic volcano model was derived with excellent agreement with experimental observations reported to date, which was further used to rapidly screen high-performance catalysts with the input of ML-predicted {\Delta}GOH*. Most importantly, this universal framework can significantly improve the efficiency of catalyst design by considering multiple types of materials at the same time, which can dramatically accelerate the screening of high-performance catalysts.</description>

      <title>Is fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo reproducible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Coupled Cluster Theory with Approximate Triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to explore the effects of high levels of electron correlation on the real-time coupled cluster formalism and algorithmic behavior, we introduce a time-dependent implementation of the CC3 singles, doubles and approximate triples method. We demonstrate the validity of our derivation and implementation using specific applications of frequency-dependent properties. Terms with triples are calculated and added to the existing CCSD equations, giving the method a nominal $\textit{O}(N^{7})$ scaling. We also use a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated implementation to reduce the computational cost, which we find can speed up the calculation by up to a factor of 17 for test cases of water clusters. In addition, we compare the impact of using single-precision arithmetic compared to conventional double-precision arithmetic. We find no significant difference in polarizabilities and optical-rotation tensor results, but a somewhat larger error for first hyperpolarizabilities. Compared to linear response (LR) CC3 results, the percentage errors of RT-CC3 polarizabilities and RT-CC3 first hyperpolarizabilities are under 0.1% and 1%, respectively, for a water-molecule test case in a double-zeta basis set. Furthermore, we compare the dynamic polarizabilities obtained using RT-CC3, RT-CCSD, and time-dependent nonorthogonal orbital-optimized coupled cluster doubles (TDNOCCD), in order to examine the performance of RT-CC3 and the orbital-optimization effect using a set of ten-electron systems.</description>

Abstract: A complete Dusty-Gas Model for the H$_2$--H$_2$O mixture in the anode transport layer of the anode-supported SOFC is considered. An exact conservation law relating the total pressure and hydrogen molar fraction at any point inside the anode to their values in the anode channel is derived. Using this conservation law, approximate analytical solutions for the hydrogen molar fraction and total pressure in the anode transport layer are obtained. The solutions can be used to calculate concentration overpotential.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dermal Permeation of Skin Oil Oxidation Products from Enhanced Sampling Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. We demonstrate that statistical errors due to insufficient sampling are substantial and propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</description>

      <title>Quadruply Bonded Mo$_2$ Molecules: An Emitter-Resonator Integrated Quantum System in Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.</description>
