      <title>$NJ/\psi$ and $N\eta_c$ interactions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between nucleon and charmonia ($J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$) is expected to deepen our understanding of various aspects in nonperturbative QCD ranging from the origin of nucleon mass to $J/\psi$ mass modification in nuclear medium and properties of hidden-charm pentaquark states. Here, we present the low-energy $NJ/\psi$ and $N\eta_c$ interactions based on ($2+1$) flavor lattice QCD simulations with nearly physical pion mass $m_\pi=146$ MeV. The interactions, extracted from the spacetime correlations of the nucleon and charmonium system by using the HAL QCD method, are found to be attractive in all distances and manifest a characteristic long-range tail consistent with the two-pion exchange interaction. The resulting scattering lengths are around $0.3$ fm, $0.4$ fm and $0.2$ fm for $NJ/\psi$ with spin $3/2$, with spin $1/2$, and $N\eta_c$, respectively. Our results are orders of magnitude larger than those from the photoproduction experiments assuming the vector meson dominance.</description>

      <title>Improving HISQ propagator solves using deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm employs mixed precision and even-odd preconditioning to compute propagators for highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ). This approach suffers from critical slowing down as the light quark mass is decreased to its physical value. Multigrid is one alternative to combat critical slowing down; however, it involves setup costs that are not always easy to amortize. We consider deflation, which can also remove critical slowing down, but incurs its own setup cost to compute eigenvectors. Results using the MILC and QUDA software libraries to generate eigenvectors and to perform deflated solves on lattices up to $144^3 \times 288$ (with lattice spacing 0.04 fm) and with a range of quark masses from the physical strange down to the physical light quark values will be presented. We compare with CG and comment on deflation versus multigrid.</description>

      <title>Progress in Normalizing Flows for 4d Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalizing flows have arisen as a tool to accelerate Monte Carlo sampling for lattice field theories. This work reviews recent progress in applying normalizing flows to 4-dimensional nonabelian gauge theories, focusing on two advancements: an architectural improvement referred to as learned active loops, and the application of correlated ensemble methods to QCD with $N_f=2$ dynamical fermions.</description>

      <title>Transverse force distributions in the proton from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-spin asymmetries observed in polarised deep-inelastic scattering are important probes of hadron structure. The Sivers asymmetry provides information about the transverse momentum of the struck quark and can be related to final-state interactions. Understanding these asymmetries at the quark level has been the subject of much interest in QCD phenomenology. In this contribution, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the transverse spatial distribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton. Our lattice calculations employ $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavours of dynamical fermions at the SU(3) symmetric point across three lattice spacings. We determine a central, spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent force distributions with local forces larger than the QCD string tension. These distributions offer a new, complimentary picture that underlies the Sivers asymmetry in transversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Transition in Hyper Stealth Dark Matter using M\"{o}bius Domain Wall Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order confinement transition of a strongly coupled composite dark matter theory can provide a possible source of gravitational waves in the early universe. In this work, on behalf of the Lattice Strong Dynamics (LSD) Collaboration, we present our recent investigation on the finite temperature confinement transition of the one-flavor SU(4) dark gauge theory named Hyper Stealth Dark Matter (HSDM). The dark matter candidate in this theory is a composite bosonic baryon and can have a remarkably low mass of a few GeV. We expect the finite temperature transition to be first-order over at least in some finite range of fermionic masses and to be a potential source of observable gravitational radiation. The finite temperature simulation of one-flavor SU(4) is done by using M\"{o}bius Domain wall fermions. The order of the transition and its fermionic mass dependence are explored by monitoring the Polyakov loop, chiral condensate and topological charge using three lattice volumes at $N_t=8$.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow of the Weinberg operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary results on the susceptibilities involving the CP-violating (CPV) Weinberg three-gluon operator and the topological $\Theta$ term using the gradient flow scheme, and study their continuum and chiral extrapolations. These are used to provide an estimate of the $\Theta$ induced by the Weinberg operator in theories with the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism. Combined with the calculations of the matrix elements (MEs) of quark-bilinears between nucleon states, such calculations will enable estimates of the electric dipole moments (EDMs) and CPV pion-nucleon couplings due to the Weinberg operator, thereby providing robust constraints on beyond the standard model (BSM) physics.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements have made it possible to approximate light-cone correlation functions in lattice QCD by computing their Euclidean counterparts. In these proceedings, we review key developments in this approach and explore their direct implications for Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). Furthermore, we emphasize the pivotal role of GPDs in uncovering the internal structure of hadrons and beyond.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor in the 2D Ising CFT in full modular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of lattice operators for the energy-momentum (EM) tensor in the Ising CFT is derived in the spin variables. Our expression works under arbitrary affine transformation both on triangular and hexagonal lattices (where the former includes the rectangular lattices). The correctness of the operators is numerically confirmed in Monte Carlo calculations by comparing the results with the conformal Ward identity, including the operator normalization. In the derivation of the EM tensor, a staggered structure of the affine-transformed hexagonal lattice is analyzed, which shows a peculiar shift from the circumcenter dual lattice and appears as a mixing angle between the holomorphic part $T(z)$ and the antiholomorphic part $\tilde T(\bar z)$. The details of this contribution will appear in a subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>Dense and magnetized QCD from imaginary chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we computed the equation of state of dense QCD in the presence of background magnetic fields using lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential. Our simulations include 2+1+1 flavors of stout-smeared staggered fermions with masses at the physical point and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. Using several expansion schemes, we tuned our simulation parameters such that the equation of state satisfies strangeness neutrality and isospin asymmetry constraints, which are relevant to the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions. Our results suggest a strong change in the equation of state due to the magnetic field, in particular, around the crossover temperature. A continuum extrapolation of our data is still needed for future applications of our equation of state to heavy-ion-collision phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect via Kubo formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceedings article, we present the first steps towards the determination of the out-of-equilibrium conductivity of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in the presence of strong interactions. Using linear response theory, we obtain an analytical expression for the spectral function associated with this effect at one-loop in perturbation theory. In addition, we provide a first estimate of the CME conductivity by calculating the associated Euclidean correlator using quenched Wilson fermions and dynamical staggered fermions in physical Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations. In particular, we focus on the midpoint of the correlator, which can be used as a proxy of the full conductivity. We present results in a wide range of temperatures, showing how this observable is suppressed at low temperatures, while at high temperatures it approaches the perturbation theory prediction.</description>

      <title>Lattice techniques to investigate the strong $CP$ problem: lessons from a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have claimed that the strong $CP$ problem does not occur in QCD, proposing a new order of limits in volume and topological sectors when studying observables on the lattice. We study the effect of the topological term on a simple quantum mechanical rotor that allows a lattice description. We particularly focus on recent proposals to face the challenging problems that this study poses in lattice QCD and that are also present in the quantum rotor, such as topology freezing and the sign problem.</description>

      <title>$U(1)_A$ Breaking in Hot QCD in the Chiral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple instanton-based random matrix model of hot QCD that in the quenched case precisely reproduces the distribution of the lowest lattice overlap Dirac eigenvalues. Even after including dynamical quarks the model can be easily simulated in volumes and for quark masses that will be out of reach for direct lattice simulations in the foreseeable future. Our simulations show that quantities connected to the $U(1)_A$ and $SU(N_f)_A$ chiral symmetry are dominated by eigenvalues in a peak of the spectral density that becomes singular at zero in the thermodynamic limit. This spectral peak turns out to be produced by an ideal instanton gas. By generalizing Banks-Casher type integrals for the singular spectral density, definite predictions can be given for physical quantities that are essential to test chiral symmetry breaking, but presently impossible to compute reliably with direct lattice simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from an investigation of the $N$-dependency of the confined-deconfined interface tension and latent heat in pure SU($N$) gauge theory at large $N$. The interface tension is determined by measuring the transverse fluctuations of the phase interface on large lattices with coexisting confined and deconfined phases. We observe unambiguously that both the interface tension and latent heat scale as $N^2$ at large $N$.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling in (2+1+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling $\alpha_\mathrm{s}$ can be obtained from the static energy as shown in previous lattices studies. For short distances, the static energy can be calculated both on the lattice with the use of Wilson line correlators, and with the perturbation theory up to three loop accuracy with leading ultrasoft log resummation. Comparing the perturbative expression and lattice data allows for precise determination of $\alpha_\mathrm{s}(m_Z)$. We will present preliminary results for the determination of $\alpha_\mathrm{s} {(M_Z)}$ in (2+1+1)-flavor QCD using the configurations made availableby the MILC-collaboration with smallest lattice spacing reaching 0.0321fm.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Physics from Asymptotic Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dilaton is investigated from first principles in an asymptotically free Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory in three dimensions. In the limit of many fermion flavours, the theory features a finite line of strongly interacting fixed points with continuous quantum phase transitions and a massless Goldstone boson, the dilaton, following spontaneous scale symmetry breaking at its endpoint. Interestingly, we find that the emergence of a vacuum expectation value and a dilaton can be understood as a double-scaling limit. Exploiting the scalar two-point function, we identify the dilaton in the spectrum, compute its decay constant, and obtain universal expressions for the induced dilaton mass in terms of small perturbations. Consistency of findings with soft dilaton theorems is equally established. Implications for spontaneously broken conformal theories are indicated.</description>

      <title>Effect of a repulsive three-body interaction on the $DD^{(*)}K$ molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadronic molecular picture of the observed exotic states has inspired numerous investigations into few-body systems. Recently, the lattice effective field theory studied the effect of a three-body interaction on the binding energy of the $DD^{*}K$ system, revealing an intriguing phenomenon in the binding energy. This work uses the Gaussian expansion method to explore the underlying physics. Our results show that as the repulsive three-body interaction strengthens, the spatial size of the $DD^{(*)}K$ bound state gradually increases. Further enhancement of the three-body interaction causes the $DD^{(*)}K$ three-body bound state to break into a $D^{(*)}K$ two-body bound state, accompanied by a distant $D$ meson. The identical nature of the two $D$ mesons leads to the fact that the $DDK$ system consistently resembles an isosceles triangle-shaped spatial configuration.</description>

The calculation has been carried out in lattice Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing. Using variationally optimized operators, the matrix elements are extracted from ratios of three-point functions to two-point functions. The glueball GFFs and their kinematic dependence are compared to those of other hadrons from previous calculations.</description>

      <title>Utility of a hybrid approach to the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate calculation of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarisation (LOHVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu$) is key to determining whether a discrepancy, suggesting new physics, exists between the Standard Model and experimental results. This calculation can be expressed as an integral over Euclidean time of a current-current correlator $G(t)$, where $G(t)$ can be calculated using lattice QCD or, with dispersion relations, from experimental data for $e^+e^-\to\mbox{hadrons}$. The BMW/DMZ collaboration recently presented a hybrid approach in which $G(t)$ is calculated using lattice QCD for most of the contributing $t$ range, but using experimental data for the largest $t$ (lowest energy) region. Here we study the advantages of varying the position $t=t_1$ separating lattice QCD from data-driven contributions. The total LOHVP contribution should be independent of $t_1$, providing both a test of the experimental input and the robustness of the hybrid approach. We use this criterion and a correlated fit to show that Fermilab/HPQCD/MILC lattice QCD results from 2019 strongly favour the CMD-3 cross-section data for $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ over a combination of earlier experimental results for this channel. Further, the resulting total LOHVP contribution obtained is consistent with the result obtained by BMW/DMZ, and supports the scenario in which there is no significant discrepancy between the experimental value for $a_\mu$ and that expected in the Standard Model. We then discuss how improved lattice results in this hybrid approach could provide a more accurate total LOHVP across a wider range of $t_1$ values with an uncertainty that is smaller than that from either lattice QCD or data-driven approaches on their own.</description>

      <title>$\theta$ dependence of $T_c$ in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exploratory study to determine the confinement-deconfinement transition temperature at finite $\theta$, $T_c(\theta)$, for the 4d \SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory. Lattice numerical simulations are performed on three spatial sizes $N_S=24$, $32$, $48$ with a fixed temporal size $N_T=8$. We introduce a non-zero $\theta$-angle by the sub-volume method to mitigate the sign problem. By taking advantage of the universality in the second order phase transition and the Binder cumulant of the order parameter, the $\theta$-dependence of $T_c$ is determined to be $T_c(\theta)/T_c(0)=1-0.16(2)\,(\theta/\pi)^2-0.03(4)\,(\theta/\pi)^4$ up to $\theta\sim 0.9\,\pi$. The reliability of the extrapolations in the sub-volume method is extensively checked. We also point out that the temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility should exhibit a singularity with the exponent for the specific heat.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the subtraction function in forward Compton amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subtraction function plays a pivotal role in calculations involving the forward Compton amplitude, which is crucial for predicting the Lamb shift in muonic atom, as well as the proton-neutron mass difference. In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the subtraction function using two domain wall fermion gauge ensembles at the physical pion mass. We utilize a recently proposed subtraction point, demonstrating its advantage in mitigating statistical and systematic uncertainties by eliminating the need for ground-state subtraction. Our results reveal significant contributions from $N\pi$ intermediate states to the subtraction function. Incorporating these contributions, we compute the proton, neutron and nucleon isovector subtraction functions at photon momentum transfer $Q^2\in[0,2]$ GeV$^2$. For the proton subtraction function, we compare our lattice results with chiral perturbation theory prediction at low $Q^2$ and with the results from the perturbative operator-product expansion at high $Q^2$. Finally, using these subtraction functions as input, we determine their contribution to two-photon exchange effects in the Lamb shift and isovector nucleon electromagnetic self-energy.</description>

      <title>Toward QCD on Quantum Computer: Orbifold Lattice Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation of minimal holographic sparsified SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and $q=4$ (quartic interactions) which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k\ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms times 1/$N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{3/2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{6}$ gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model and simulate real-time dynamics up to scrambling time.</description>

      <title>Chiral gauge theories, generalized anomalies and breakdown of the color-flavor-locked center symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the strong-interaction dynamics of a class of $4D$ chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories with a fermion in a symmetric second-rank tensor representation and a number of fermions in an anti-antisymmetric tensor representation, extending the previous work on chiral gauge theories such as the Bars-Yankielowicz and the generalized Georgi-Glashow models. The main tool of our analysis is the anomalies obstructing the gauging of certain 1-form color-flavor-locked center symmetry, together with some flavor symmetries. The matching requirement for these mixed-anomalies strongly favors dynamical Higgs phases caused by bifermion condensate formation, against a confinement phase with no condensates and no symmetry breaking, or a confinement phase with multifermion color-singlet condensates only. Dynamical gauge symmetry breaking and the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry caused by such condensates mean that the color-flavor-locked 1-form center symmetry itself is lost in the infrared. One is led to a solution, if not unique, which satisfies fully the conventional as well as the new, generalized 't Hooft anomaly matching requirements.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Vacuum in Discrete Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a quantum cellular automata model of fermions in discrete spacetime which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

      <title>Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretical approach to neutral pion contribution to muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadronic light-by-light scattering induces a substantial contribution to the muon $g-2$ with present accuracy of its measurement. The effect caused by the neutral pion through this scattering on the muon $g-2$ has been scrutinized intensively by model calculation and lattice QCD simulation. All of those estimates have been done based on one formula, but it has one pathological aspect. The purpose of this article is to resolve such a pathology from a field-theoretical approach, i.e., by defining the effect in question as the neutral pion intermediate state contribution to the QCD vacuum expectation value of time-ordered product of four electromagnetic currents. It leads (1) the pion pole term corresponding to the imaginary part of the pion propagator $\frac{1}{q^2 - m_\pi^2 + \mathrm{i} \epsilon}$, (2) and no principle value term corresponding to its real part, resolving the pathology.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enhanced Optimization of Noise-Resilient Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a powerful class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms designed to approximate the ground state of a quantum system described by its Hamiltonian. VQEs hold promise for various applications, including lattice field theory. However, the inherent noise of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses a significant challenge for running VQEs as these algorithms are particularly susceptible to noise, e.g., measurement shot noise and hardware noise.
  In a recent work, it was proposed to enhance the classical optimization of VQEs with Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Optimization, as these machine-learning techniques are well-suited for handling noisy data. In these proceedings, we provide additional insights into this new algorithm and present further numerical experiments. In particular, we examine the impact of hardware noise and error mitigation on the algorithm's performance. We validate the algorithm using classical simulations of quantum hardware, including hardware noise benchmarks, which have not been considered in previous works. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that GP-enhanced algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art baselines, laying the foundation for future research on deploying these techniques to real quantum hardware and lattice field theory setups.</description>
