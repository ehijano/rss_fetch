      <title>Distributed Signal Processing for Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Array Systems: State-of-the-Art and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) play a critical role in enabling the functionalities of next generation wireless communication systems. However, as the number of antennas increases, ELAA systems face significant bottlenecks, such as excessive interconnection costs and high computational complexity. Efficient distributed signal processing (SP) algorithms show great promise in overcoming these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of distributed SP algorithms for ELAA systems, tailored to address these bottlenecks. We start by presenting three representative forms of ELAA systems: single-base station ELAA systems, coordinated distributed antenna systems, and ELAA systems integrated with emerging technologies. For each form, we review the associated distributed SP algorithms in the literature. Additionally, we outline several important future research directions that are essential for improving the performance and practicality of ELAA systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Capacity of 1-Bit MIMO Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the capacity of multi-antenna fading channels with 1-bit quantized output per receive antenna. Specifically, leveraging Bayesian statistical tools, we analyze the asymptotic regime with a large number of receive antennas. In the coherent case, where the channel state information (CSI) is known at the receiver's side, we completely characterize the asymptotic capacity and provide the exact scaling in the extreme regimes of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of transmit antennas. In the non-coherent case, where the CSI is unknown but remains constant during T symbol periods, we first obtain the exact asymptotic capacity for T&lt;=3. Then, we propose a scheme involving uniform signaling in the covariance space and derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the capacity for an arbitrary block size T. Furthermore, we propose a genie-aided upper bound where the channel is revealed to the receiver. We show that the upper and lower bounds coincide when T is large. In the low SNR regime, we derive the asymptotic capacity up to a vanishing term, which, remarkably, matches our capacity lower bound.</description>

      <title>Telecommand Rejection Probability for CCSDS-compliant LDPC-Coded Transmissions with Tail Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) recommendation for TeleCommand (TC) synchronization and coding, the Communications Link Transmission Unit (CLTU) consists of a start sequence, followed by coded data, and a tail sequence, which might be optional depending on the employed coding scheme. With regard to the latter, these transmissions traditionally use a modified Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) code, to which two state-of-the-art Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes were later added. As a lightweight technique to detect the presence of the tail sequence, an approach based on decoding failure has traditionally been used, choosing a non-correctable string as the tail sequence. This works very well with the BCH code, for which bounded-distance decoders are employed. When the same approach is employed with LDPC codes, it is necessary to design the tail sequence as a non-correctable string for the case of iterative decoders based on belief propagation. Moreover, the tail sequence might be corrupted by noise, potentially converting it into a correctable pattern. It is therefore important that the tail sequence is chosen to be as much distant as possible, according to some metric, from any legitimate codeword. In this paper we study such problem, and analyze the TC rejection probability both theoretically and through simulations. Such a performance figure, being the rate at which the CLTU is discarded, should clearly be minimized. Our analysis is performed considering many different choices of the system parameters (e.g., length of the CLTU, decoding algorithm, maximum number of decoding iterations).</description>

      <title>Some $3$-designs invariant under $2.P{\Sigma}L(2,49).$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a ternary [49,25,7] code from the row span of a Jacobsthal matrix. It is equivalent to a Generalized Quadratic Residue (GQR) code in the sense of van Lint and MacWilliams (1978). These codes are the abelian generalizations of the quadratic residue (QR) codes which are cyclic. The union of the [50,25,8] extension of the said code and its dual supports a 3-(50,14,1248) design. The automorphism group of the latter design is a double cover of the permutation part of the automorphism group of the [50,25,8] code, which is isomorphic to $P{\Sigma}L(2,49).$ Other weights in this code, other GQR codes, and other QR codes yield other 3-designs by the same process. A simple group action argument is provided to explain this behaviour of isodual codes.</description>

      <title>A Lossless Compression Technique for the Downlink Control Information Message</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the reliability and spectral efficiency of wireless systems is a key goal in wireless systems. However, most efforts have been devoted to improving data channel capacity, whereas control-plane capacity bottlenecks are often neglected. In this paper, we propose a means of improving the control-plane capacity and reliability by shrinking the bit size of a key signaling message - the 5G Downlink Control Information (DCI). In particular, a transformer model is studied as a probability distribution estimator for Arithmetic coding to achieve lossless compression. Feature engineering, neural model design, and training technique are comprehensively discussed in this paper. Both temporal and spatial correlations among DCI messages are explored by the transformer model to achieve reasonable lossless compression performance. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves 21.7% higher compression ratio than Huffman coding in DCI compression for a single-cell scheduling scenario.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Algorithms for Alphabetic Codes and Binary Search Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alphabetic codes and binary search trees are combinatorial structures that abstract search procedures in ordered sets endowed with probability distributions. In this paper, we design new linear-time algorithms to construct alphabetic codes, and we show that the obtained codes are not too far from being optimal. Moreover, we exploit our results on alphabetic codes to provide new bounds on the average cost of optimal binary search trees. Our results improve on the best-known bounds on the average cost of optimal binary search trees present in the literature.</description>

      <title>Constrained coding upper bounds via Goulden-Jackson cluster theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in DNA-based data storage, constrained codes have attracted a considerable amount of attention from both academia and industry. We study the maximum cardinality of constrained codes for which the constraints can be characterized by a set of forbidden substrings, where by a substring we mean some consecutive coordinates in a string.
  For finite-type constrained codes (for which the set of forbidden substrings is finite), one can compute their capacity (code rate) by the ``spectral method'', i.e., by applying the Perron-Frobenious theorem to the de Brujin graph defined by the code. However, there was no systematic method to compute the exact cardinality of these codes.
  We show that there is a surprisingly powerful method arising from enumerative combinatorics, which is based on the Goulden-Jackson cluster theorem (previously not known to the coding community), that can be used to compute not only the capacity, but also the exact formula for the cardinality of these codes, for each fixed code length. Moreover, this can be done by solving a system of linear equations of size equal to the number of constraints.
  We also show that the spectral method and the cluster method are inherently related by establishing a direct connection between the spectral radius of the de Brujin graph used in the first method and the convergence radius of the generating function used in the second method.
  Lastly, to demonstrate the flexibility of the new method, we use it to give an explicit upper bound on the maximum cardinality of variable-length non-overlapping codes, which are a class of constrained codes defined by an infinite number of forbidden substrings.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fronthaul Compression in Massive MIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future generations of cellular systems presume to use an extremely high number of antennas to enable mm waves. Increasing the number of antennas requires a growth in connections between a remote radio head (RRH) and a baseband unit (BBU). Therefore, the traffic load between RRH and BBU has to grow, and the compression of interconnection between them becomes a serious problem. In this paper, we propose a compression scheme to reduce the bitrate of the fronthaul interface that connects BBU and RRU. Then we justify compression block size and mantissa length to guarantee the required error vector magnitude (EVM). The knowledge of propagation channel sparsity and the condition number of the channel matrix helps to achieve higher compression ratios without performance loss. Simulation results with a realistic propagation channel are provided to confirm theoretical derivations.</description>

      <title>Joint Resource-Power Allocation and UE Rank Selection in Multi-User MIMO Systems with Linear Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks aim to deliver data speeds much faster than 5G. This requires base stations with lots of antennas and a large operating bandwidth. These advanced base stations are expected to serve several multi-antenna user-equipment (UEs) simultaneously on the same time-frequency resources on both the uplink and the downlink. The UE data rates are affected by the following three main factors: UE rank, which refers to the number of data layers used by each UE, UE frequency allocation, which refers to the assignment of slices of the overall frequency band to use for each UE in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, and UE power allocation/control, which refers to the power allocated by the base station for data transmission to each UE on the downlink or the power used by the UE to send data on the uplink. Since multiple UEs are to be simultaneously served, the type of precoder used for downlink transmission and the type of receiver used for uplink reception predominantly influence these three aforementioned factors and the resulting overall UE throughput. This paper addresses the problem of jointly selecting these three parameters specifically when zero-forcing (ZF) precoders are used for downlink transmission and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) receivers are employed for uplink reception.</description>

      <title>Considering dynamical synergy and integrated information; the unusual case of minimum mutual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief note considers the problem of estimating temporal synergy and integrated information in dyadic dynamical processes. One of the standard estimators of dynamic synergy is based on the minimal mutual information between sets of elements, however, despite it's increasingly widespread use, the mathematical features of this redundancy function have largely gone unexplored. Here, we show that it has two previously unrecognized limitations: it cannot disambiguate between truly integrated systems and disintegrated systems with first-order autocorrelation. Second, paradoxically, there are some systems that become more synergistic when dis-integrated (as long as first-order autocorrelations are preserved). In these systems, integrated information can decrease while synergy simultaneously increases. We derive conditions under which this occurs and discuss the implications of these findings for past and future work in applied fields such as neuroscience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What will the future of cislunar communications be? The ever-expanding horizons of the space exploration missions, and the need for establishing sustainable space communication and navigation infrastructure necessitate to think this question thoroughly. In this article, we examine how some of the concepts of 6G technologies developed for terrestrial networks can be relevant in the context of cislunar networks. We discuss how 6G concepts, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, quantum-resistant physical layer security, private information read/write/cache networks, semantic and goal-oriented communications, information freshness based quality of communication metrics, multi-relay and cooperative networks, hold the potential to shape the future of cislunar communications.</description>

      <title>Unextendible entanglement of quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication relies on the existence of high quality quantum channels to exchange information. In practice, however, all communication links are affected by noise from the environment. Here we investigate the ability of quantum channels to perform quantum communication tasks by restricting the participants to use only local operations and one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC) along with the available quantum channel. In particular, a channel can be used to distill a highly entangled state between two parties, which further enables quantum or private communication. In this work, we invoke the framework of superchannels to study the distillation of a resourceful quantum state, such as a maximally entangled state or a private state, using multiple instances of a point-to-point quantum channel. We use the idea of $k$-extendibility to obtain a semidefinite relaxation of the set of one-way LOCC superchannels and define a class of entanglement measures for quantum channels that decrease monotonically under such superchannels; therefore these measures, dubbed collectively the ``unextendible entanglement of a channel'', yield upper bounds on several communication-theoretic quantities of interest in the regimes of resource distillation and zero error. We then generalize the formalism of $k$-extendibility to bipartite superchannels, thus obtaining functions that are monotone under two-extendible superchannels. This allows us to analyze probabilistic distillation of ebits or secret key bits from a bipartite state when using a resourceful quantum channel. Moreover, we propose semidefinite programs to evaluate several of these quantities, providing a computationally feasible method of comparison between quantum channels for resource distillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal quantum states pose a fundamental challenge in quantum information processing, as they cannot be distinguished with absolute certainty. Conventionally, the focus has been on minimizing error probability in quantum state discrimination tasks. However, another criterion known as quantum guesswork has emerged as a crucial measure in assessing the distinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states, when we are allowed to query a sequence of states. In this paper, we generalize well known properties in the classical setting that are relevant for the guessing problem. Specifically, we establish the pre and post Data Processing Inequalities. We also derive a more refined lower bound on quantum guesswork.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum channels, pivotal in information processing, describe transformations within quantum systems and enable secure communication and error correction. Ergodic and mixing properties elucidate their behavior. In this paper, we establish a sufficient condition for mixing based on a quantum Markov-Dobrushin inequality. We prove that if the Markov-Dobrushin constant of a quantum channel exceeds zero, it exhibits exponential mixing behavior. We explore limitations of some quantum channels, demonstrating that unistochastic channels are not mixing. Additionally, we analyze ergodicity of a class of mixed-unitary channels associated with finite groups of unitary operators. Finally, we apply our results to the qubit depolarizing channel.</description>

      <title>HIERVAR: A Hierarchical Feature Selection Method for Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series classification stands as a pivotal and intricate challenge across various domains, including finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. In contemporary research, there has been a notable upsurge in exploring feature extraction through random sampling. Unlike deep convolutional networks, these methods sidestep elaborate training procedures, yet they often necessitate generating a surplus of features to comprehensively encapsulate time series nuances. Consequently, some features may lack relevance to labels or exhibit multi-collinearity with others. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical feature selection method aided by ANOVA variance analysis to address this challenge. Through meticulous experimentation, we demonstrate that our method substantially reduces features by over 94% while preserving accuracy -- a significant advancement in the field of time series analysis and feature selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction is a technique used to transform data from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space, aiming to retain as much of the original information as possible. This approach is crucial in many disciplines like engineering, biology, astronomy, and economics. In this paper, we consider the following dimensionality reduction instance: Given an n-dimensional probability distribution p and an integer m&lt;n, we aim to find the m-dimensional probability distribution q that is the closest to p, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the measure of closeness. We prove that the problem is strongly NP-hard, and we present an approximation algorithm for it.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Regularized Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the phase retrieval problem in the situation where the vector to be recovered has an a priori structure that can encoded into a regularization term. This regularizer is intended to promote solutions conforming to some notion of simplicity or low complexity. We investigate both noiseless recovery and stability to noise and provide a very general and unified analysis framework that goes far beyond the sparse phase retrieval mostly considered in the literature. In the noiseless case we provide sufficient conditions under which exact recovery, up to global sign change, is possible. For Gaussian measurement maps, we also provide a sample complexity bound for exact recovery. This bound depends on the Gaussian width of the descent cone at the soughtafter vector which is a geometric measure of the complexity of the latter. In the noisy case, we consider both the constrained (Mozorov) and penalized (Tikhonov) formulations. We provide sufficient conditions for stable recovery and prove linear convergence for sufficiently small noise. For Gaussian measurements, we again give a sample complexity bound for linear convergence to hold with high probability. This bound scales linearly in the intrinsic dimension of the sought-after vector but only logarithmically in the ambient dimension.</description>

      <title>Matrix majorization in large samples with varying support restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that a matrix $P$ with non-negative entries majorizes another such matrix $Q$ if there is a stochastic matrix $T$ such that $Q=TP$. We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multi-partite divergences that generalize the R\'enyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Private Communication with Secret Block Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel private communication framework is proposed where privacy is induced by transmitting over a channel instances of linear inverse problems that are identifiable to the legitimate receiver but unidentifiable to an eavesdropper. The gap in identifiability is created in the framework by leveraging secret knowledge between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. Specifically, the case where the legitimate receiver harnesses a secret block structure to decode a transmitted block-sparse message from underdetermined linear measurements in conditions where classical compressed sensing would provably fail is examined. The applicability of the proposed scheme to practical multiple-access wireless communication systems is discussed. The protocol's privacy is studied under a single transmission, and under multiple transmissions without refreshing the secret block structure. It is shown that, under a specific scaling of the channel dimensions and transmission parameters, the eavesdropper can attempt to overhear the block structure from the fourth-order moments of the channel output. Computation of a statistical lower bound suggests that the proposed fourth-order moment secret block estimation strategy is near optimal. The performance of a spectral clustering algorithm is studied to that end, defining scaling laws on the lifespan of the secret key before the communication is compromised. Finally, numerical experiments corroborating the theoretical findings are conducted.</description>

      <title>The entropic doubling constant and robustness of Gaussian codebooks for additive-noise channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy comparison inequalities are obtained for the differential entropy $h(X+Y)$ of the sum of two independent random vectors $X,Y$, when one is replaced by a Gaussian. For identically distributed random vectors $X,Y$, these are closely related to bounds on the entropic doubling constant, which quantifies the entropy increase when adding an independent copy of a random vector to itself. Consequences of both large and small doubling are explored. For the former, lower bounds are deduced on the entropy increase when adding an independent Gaussian, while for the latter, a qualitative stability result for the entropy power inequality is obtained. In the more general case of non-identically distributed random vectors $X,Y$, a Gaussian comparison inequality with interesting implications for channel coding is established: For additive-noise channels with a power constraint, Gaussian codebooks come within a $\frac{{\sf snr}}{3{\sf snr}+2}$ factor of capacity. In the low-SNR regime this improves the half-a-bit additive bound of Zamir and Erez (2004). Analogous results are obtained for additive-noise multiple access channels, and for linear, additive-noise MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Advanced Transceiver Technologies for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accommodate new applications such as extended reality, fully autonomous vehicular networks and the metaverse, next generation wireless networks are going to be subject to much more stringent performance requirements than the fifth-generation (5G) in terms of data rates, reliability, latency, and connectivity. It is thus necessary to develop next generation advanced transceiver (NGAT) technologies for efficient signal transmission and reception. In this tutorial, we explore the evolution of NGAT from three different perspectives. Specifically, we first provide an overview of new-field NGAT technology, which shifts from conventional far-field channel models to new near-field channel models. Then, three new-form NGAT technologies and their design challenges are presented, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, flexible antennas, and holographic multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Subsequently, we discuss recent advances in semantic-aware NGAT technologies, which can utilize new metrics for advanced transceiver designs. Finally, we point out other promising transceiver technologies for future research.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Downlink NOMA Systems: Power Allocation and Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel communication paradigm employing movable antennas (MAs) within a multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink framework, where users are equipped with MAs. Initially, leveraging the far-field response, we delineate the channel characteristics concerning both the power allocation coefficient and positions of MAs. Subsequently, we endeavor to maximize the channel capacity by jointly optimizing power allocation and antenna positions. To tackle the resultant non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) scheme underpinned by successive convex approximation (SCA) to converge towards a stationary point. Through numerical simulations, our findings substantiate the superiority of the MA-assisted NOMA system over both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and conventional NOMA configurations in terms of average sum rate and outage probability.</description>

      <title>On Simultaneous Information and Energy Transmission through Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13691v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal rate at which information can be sent through a quantum channel when the transmitted signal must simultaneously carry some minimum amount of energy is characterized. To do so, we introduce the quantum-classical analogue of the capacity-power function and generalize results in classical information theory for transmitting classical information through noisy channels. We show that the capacity-power function for a classical-quantum channel, for both unassisted and private protocol, is concave and also prove additivity for unentangled and uncorrelated ensembles of input signals for such channels. This implies we do not need regularized formulas for calculation. We show these properties also hold for all noiseless channels when we restrict the set of input states to be pure quantum states. For general channels, we find that the capacity-power function is piece-wise concave. We give an elegant visual proof for this supported by numerical simulations. We connect channel capacity and properties of random quantum states. In particular, we obtain analytical expressions for the capacity-power function for the case of noiseless channels using properties of random quantum states under an energy constraint and concentration phenomena in large Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Channel Shaping Using Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: Analysis, Optimization, and Enhanced Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capability of a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to redistribute the singular values of point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels for achieving power and rate gains. We depart from the conventional Diagonal (D)-RIS with diagonal phase shift matrix and adopt a Beyond Diagonal (BD) architecture that offers greater wave manipulation flexibility through element-wise connections. Specifically, we first provide shaping insights by characterizing the channel singular value regions attainable by D-RIS and BD-RIS via a novel geodesic optimization. Analytical singular value bounds are then derived to explore their shaping limits in typical deployment scenarios. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) and a shaping-inspired low-complexity approach. Results show that compared to D-RIS, BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of all channel singular values, the trade-off in manipulating them, and thus the channel power and achievable rate. Those observations become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements and MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission at lower transmit power than D-RIS, hence achieving the asymptotic Degrees of Freedom (DoF) at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) thanks to its higher flexibility of shaping the distribution of channel singular values.</description>

      <title>The syzygy distinguisher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the error-correcting capability, hence better than that of generic decoding algorithms. Moreover it does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>
