      <title>The Modular Isomorphism Problem -- the alternative perspective on counterexamples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a result of impressive research arXiv:2106.07231, D.~Garcia-Lucas, A. del Rio and L. Margolis defined an infinite series of non-isomorphic $2$-groups $G$ and $H$, whose group algebras $\mathbb{F}G$ and $\mathbb{F}H$ over the field $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_2$ are isomorphic, solving negatively the long-standing Modular Isomorphism Problem (MIP). In this note we give a different perspective on their examples and show that they are special cases of a more general construction. We also show that this type of construction for $p&gt;2$ does not provide a similar counterexample to the MIP.</description>

      <title>Surface groups among cubulated hyperbolic and one-relator groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a non-positively curved cube complex with hyperbolic fundamental group. We prove that $\pi_1(X)$ has a non-free subgroup of infinite index unless $\pi_1(X)$ is either free or a surface group, answering a question of Wise. A similar result for one-relator groups follows, answering a question posed by several authors. The proof relies on a careful analysis of free and cyclic splittings of cubulated groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the capable and isoclinic properties of the tensor square in the context of multiplicative Lie algebras. We also developed the concept of isoclinic extensions and proved several results for multiplicative Lie algebras. Consequently, we demonstrate that covers of a multiplicative Lie algebra are mutually isoclinic.</description>

      <title>Distal Actions of Automorphisms of Nilpotent Groups $G$ on Sub_$G$ and Applications to Lattices in Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.01446v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a locally compact group $G$, we study the distality of the action of automorphisms $T$ of $G$ on ${\rm Sub}_G$, the compact space of closed subgroups of $G$ endowed with the Chabauty topology. For a certain class of discrete groups $G$, we show that $T$ acts distally on ${\rm Sub}_G$ if and only if $T^n$ is the identity map for some $n\in{\mathbb N}$. As an application, we get that for a $T$-invariant lattice $\Gamma$ in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group $G$, $T$ acts distally on ${\rm Sub}_G$ if and only if it acts distally on ${\rm Sub}_\Gamma$. This also holds for any closed $T$-invariant co-compact subgroup $\Gamma$. For a lattice $\Gamma$ in a simply connected solvable Lie group, we study conditions under which its automorphisms act distally on ${\rm Sub}_\Gamma$. We construct an example highlighting the difference between the behaviour of automorphisms on a lattice in a solvable Lie group from that in a nilpotent Lie group. For torsion-free compactly generated nilpotent (metrizable) groups $G$, we obtain the following characterisation: $T$ acts distally on ${\rm Sub}_G$ if and only if $T$ is contained in a compact subgroup of ${\rm Aut}(G)$. Using these results, we characterise the class of such groups $G$ which act distally on ${\rm Sub}_G$. We also show that any compactly generated distal group $G$ is Lie projective. As a consequence, we get some results on the structure of compactly generated nilpotent groups.</description>

      <title>Bit by Bit: Gravity Through the Lens of Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation reviews several recent advances at the intersection of quantum information and holography. In holography, properties of quantum systems admit a gravitational interpretation via the AdS/CFT correspondence. For holographic states, boundary entanglement entropy is dual to bulk geodesic areas, known as Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces. Furthermore, the viability to possess a holographic dual at all is constrained by entanglement structure. Accordingly, entanglement enables a coarse classification of states in a Hilbert space. Similarly, state transformation under operator groups also provides a classification on the Hilbert space. Stabilizer states, for example, are invariant under large sets of operations and consequently can be simulated on a classical computer. Cayley graphs offer a useful representation for a group of operators, where vertices represent group elements and edges represent generators. The orbit of a state under action of the group can also be represented as a "reachability graph", a quotient of the group Cayley graph. Reachability graphs can be dressed to encode entanglement information, making them a useful tool for studying entanglement dynamics. Quotienting a reachability graph by group elements that fix a state computable, e.g. entanglement entropy, builds a "contracted graph". Contracted graphs explicitly bound state parameter evolution in quantum circuits. In this thesis, an upper bound on entanglement entropy evolution in Clifford circuits is presented. Another important property of quantum systems is magic, which quantifies the difficulty of simulating a quantum state. Magic and entanglement play complementary roles when describing emergent phenomena in AdS/CFT. This work describes the interplay of entanglement and magic, offering holographic consequences for magic as cosmic brane back-reaction.</description>

      <title>Spatial models for boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that up to a null set, every infinite measure-preserving action of a locally compact Polish group can be turned into a continuous measure-preserving action on a locally compact Polish space where the underlying measure is Radon. We also investigate the distinction between spatial and boolean actions in the infinite measure-preserving setup. We finally obtain a streamlined proof of a recent result of Avraham-Re'em and Roy: Levy groups cannot admit nontrivial continous measure-preserving actions on Polish spaces when the measure is locally finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through a Hopf algebraic approach, we develop a framework for formal differentiation and integration and prove a correspondence theorem that comprises the Lazard correspondence, the Malcev correspondence and the formal integration of complete connected Lie algebras with characteristic 0. We then apply this theory to obtain a correspondence theorem for classes of left nilpotent skew braces on a nilpotent group and left nilpotent post-Lie rings on a nilpotent Lie ring.</description>

      <title>Group actions on orbits of an amenable equivalence relation and topological versions of Kesten's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish results connecting the uniform Liouville property of group actions on the classes of a countable Borel equivalence relation with amenability of this equivalence relation. We also study extensions of Kesten's theorem to certain classes of topological groups and prove a version of this theorem for amenable SIN groups. Furthermore, we discuss relationship between generalizations of Kesten's theorem and anticoncentration inequalities for the inverted orbits of random walks on the classes of an amenable equivalence relation. This allows us to construct an amenable Polish group that does not satisfy the limit conditions in combinatorial extensions of Kesten's theorem.</description>

      <title>The structure of a finite group and the maximum $\pi$-index of its elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of primes $\pi$, the $\pi$-index of an element $x$ of a finite group $G$ is the $\pi$-part of the index of the centralizer of $x$ in $G$. If $\pi=\{p\}$ is a singleton, we just say the $p$-index. If the $\pi$-index of $x$ is equal to $p_1^{k_1}\ldots p^{k_s}$, where $p_1,\ldots,p_s$ are distinct primes, then we set $\exp_\pi(x)=k_1+\ldots+k_s$. In this short note, we study how the number $\epsilon_\pi(G)=\max\{\epsilon_\pi(x):x\in G\}$ restricts the structure of the factor group $G/Z(G)$ of $G$ by its center. First, for a finite group $G$, we prove that $\phi_p(G/Z(G))\leq\epsilon_p(G)$, where $\phi_p(G/Z(G))$ is the Frattini length of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G/Z(G)$. Second, for a $\pi$-separable finite group $G$, we prove that $l_\pi(G/Z(G))\leq\epsilon_\pi(G)$, where $l_{\pi}(G/Z(G))$ is the $\pi$-length of $G/Z(G)$.</description>

      <title>Principal 2-blocks with wreathed defect groups up to splendid Morita equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13621v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify principal $2$-blocks of finite groups $G$ with Sylow $2$-subgroups isomorphic to a wreathed $2$-group $C_{2^n}\wr C_2$ with $n\geq 2$ up to Morita equivalence and up to splendid Morita equivalence. As a consequence, we obtain that Puig's Finiteness Conjecture holds for such blocks. Furthermore, we obtain a classification of such groups modulo $O_{2'}(G)$, which is a pure group theoretical result and of independent interest. Methods previously applied to blocks of tame representation type are used. They are, however, further developed in order to deal with blocks of wild representation type.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>
