      <title>Radon Partitions of Random Gaussian Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a probabilistic framework for Radon partitions, where our points are chosen independently from the $d$-dimensional normal distribution. For every point set we define a corresponding Radon polytope, which encodes all information about Radon partitions of our set - with Radon partitions corresponding to faces of the polytope. This allows us to derive expressions for the probability that a given partition of $N$ randomly chosen points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ forms a Radon partition. These expressions involve conic kinematic formulas and intrinsic volumes, and in general require repeated integration, though we obtain closed formulas in some cases. This framework can provide new perspectives on open problems that can be formulated in terms of Radon partitions, such as Reay's relaxed Tverberg conjecture.</description>

      <title>Counting with two-level polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine combinatorial counting functions with two parameters, $n$ and $q$. For fixed $q$, these functions are (quasi-)polynomial in $n$. As $q$ varies, the degree of this polynomial is itself polynomial in $q$, as are the leading coefficients. We carefully define these two-level polynomials, lay out their basic algebraic properties, and provide a schema for showing a function is a two-level polynomial. Using the schema, we prove that a variety of counting functions arising in different areas of combinatorics are two-level polynomials. These include chromatic polynomials for many infinite families of graphs, partitions of an integer into a given number of parts, placing non-attacking chess pieces on a board, Sidon sets, and Sheffer sequences (including binomial type and Appell sequences).</description>

      <title>Divided difference operators for Hessenberg representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivariant cohomology ring of a regular semisimple Hessenberg variety in type A is a free module over the equivariant cohomology ring of a point. When equipped with Tymoczko's dot action, it becomes a twisted representation of the symmetric group, and the character of this representation is given by the chromatic quasisymmetric function of an indifference graph. In this note, we use divided difference operators to decompose this representation as a direct sum of sub-representations in a way that categorifies the modular relation between chromatic quasisymmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Off-Diagonal Ramsey Numbers for Linear Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study off-diagonal Ramsey numbers $r(H, K_n^{(k)})$ of $k$-uniform hypergraphs, where $H$ is a fixed linear $k$-uniform hypergraph and $K_n^{(k)}$ is complete on $n$ vertices. Recently, Conlon et al.\ disproved the folklore conjecture that $r(H, K_n^{(3)})$ always grows polynomially in $n$. In this paper we show that much larger growth rates are possible in higher uniformity. In uniformity $k\ge 4$, we prove that for any constant $C&gt;0$, there exists a linear $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ for which $$r(H,K_n^{(k)}) \geq \twr_{k-2}(2^{(\log n)^C}).$$</description>

      <title>When does a tree activate the random graph?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ and $G$ be two graphs. A spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ is called weakly $F$-saturated if one can add to $H$ the edges of $G \setminus H$ in some order, so that whenever a new edge is added, a new copy of $F$ is formed. Obtaining lower bounds for the minimum size $\mathrm{wsat}(G,F)$ of such an $H$ is a classical problem in extremal combinatorics. In particular, in the past 40 years, various algebraic tools have been developed to prove lower bounds on the weak saturation number $\mathrm{wsat}(G,F)$. Our paper uncovers a new connection of weak saturation to topology of clique complexes, that allows to prove tight lower bounds in some cases when the algebraic tools are not efficient.
  It is easy to see that the smallest $K_3$-saturating graphs in $K_n$ are trees, thus $\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,K_3)=n-1$. In 2017, Kor\'andi and Sudakov proved that this is also the case in dense random graphs $G\sim G_{n,p}$, $p=\mathrm{const}\in(0,1)$, and posed the question of determining the smallest $p$ for which $G_{n,p}$ contains a $K_3$-saturating tree with high probability. Using the new topological connection, we show that this critical $p$ is of order $n^{-1/3-o(1)}$.
  Inspired by Gromov's local-to-global principle for hyperbolic groups, we further develop our topological approach and determine the critical probability up to a constant factor, for trees with diameter at most $n^{c}$, for some $c&gt;0$.
  The new connection also enables us to improve the best known upper bound on the threshold probability for simple connectivity of the 2-dimensional clique complex of $G_{n,p}$, due to Kahle.</description>

      <title>Longest increasing subsequences for distributions with atoms, and an inhomogeneous Hammersley process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous result by Hammersley and Versik-Kerov states that the length $L_n$ of the longest increasing subsequence among $n$ iid continuous random variables grows like $2\sqrt{n}$. We investigate here the asymptotic behavior of $L_n$ for distributions with atoms. For purely discrete random variables, we characterize the asymptotic order of $L_n$ through a variational problem and provide explicit estimates for classical distributions. The proofs rely on a coupling with an inhomogeneous version of the discrete-time continuous-space Hammersley process. This reveals that, in contrast to the continuous case, the discrete setting exhibits a wide range of growth rates between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $o(\sqrt{n})$, depending on the tail behavior of the distribution. We can then easily deduce the asymptotics of $L_n$ for a completely arbitrary distribution.</description>

      <title>On cubic vertex-transitive graphs of given girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of vertices of a graph is distinguishing if the only automorphism that preserves it is the identity. The minimal size of such sets, if they exist, is the distinguishing cost. The distinguishing costs of vertex transitive cubic graphs are well known if they are 1-arc-transitive, or if they have two edge orbits and either have girth 3 or vertex-stabilizers of order 1 or 2.
  There are many results about vertex-transitive cubic graphs of girth 4 with two edge orbits, but for larger girth almost nothing is known about %the existence or the distinguishing costs of such graphs. We prove that cubic vertex-transitive graphs of girth 5 with two edge orbits have distinguishing cost 2, and prove the non-existence of infinite 3-arc-transitive cubic graphs of girth 6.</description>

      <title>A Study of the Binary and Boolean Rank of Matrices with Small Constant Real Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the binary and Boolean rank of $0,1$ matrices that have a small rank over the reals. The relationship between these three rank functions is an important open question, and here we prove that when the real rank $d$ is a small constant, the gap between the real and the binary and Boolean rank is a small constant. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the Boolean and binary rank of matrices with real rank $1 \leq d \leq 4$, as well as determine the size of the maximal isolation set in each case. Furthermore, we prove that for $d = 3,4$, the circulant matrix defined by a row with $d-1$ consecutive ones followed by $d-1$ zeros, is the only matrix of size $(2d-2)\times (2d-2)$ with real rank $d$ and Boolean and binary rank and maximal isolation set of size $2d-2$, and this matrix achieves the maximal gap possible between the real and the binary and Boolean rank for these values of $d$.
  Our results can also be interpreted in other equivalent terms, such as finding the minimal number of bicliques needed to partition or cover the edges of a bipartite graph whose reduced adjacency matrix has real rank $1 \leq d \leq 4$. We use a combination of combinatorial and algebraic techniques combined with the assistance of a computer program.</description>

      <title>Judicious Partitions in Edge-Weighted Graphs with Bounded Maximum Weighted Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate bounds for the following judicious $k$-partitioning problem: Given an edge-weighted graph $G$, find a $k$-partition $(V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_k)$ of $V(G)$ such that the total weight of edges in the heaviest induced subgraph, $\max_{i=1}^k w(G[V_i])$, is minimized. In our bounds, we also take into account the weight $w(V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k)$ of the cut induced by the partition (i.e., the total weight of edges with endpoints in different parts) and show the existence of a partition satisfying tight bounds for both quantities simultaneously. We establish such tight bounds for the case $k=2$ and, to the best of our knowledge, present the first (even for unweighted graphs) completely tight bound for $k=3$. We also show that, in general, these results cannot be extended to $k \geq 4$ without introducing an additional lower-order term, and we propose a corresponding conjecture. Moreover, we prove that there always exists a $k$-partition satisfying $\max \left\{ w(G[V_i]) : i \in [k] \right\} \leq \frac{w(G)}{k^2} + \frac{k - 1}{2k^2} \Delta_w(G),$ where $\Delta_w(G)$ denotes the maximum weighted degree of $G$. This bound is tight for every integer $k\geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ryser conjectured that every $r$-edge-coloured complete graph can be covered by $r-1$ monochromatic trees. Motivated by a question of Austin in analysis, Mili\'cevi\'c predicted something stronger -- that every $r$-edge-coloured complete graph can be covered by $r-1$ monochromatic trees \emph{of bounded diameter}. Here we show that the two conjectures are equivalent. As immediate corollaries we obtain new results about Mili\'cevi\'c's Conjecture, most notably that it is true for $r=5$. We also obtain several new cases of a generalization of Mili\'cevi\'c's Conjecture to non-complete graphs due to DeBiasio-Kamel-McCourt-Sheats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tropical $n$-gonal construction was introduced in recent work by the first author and D.~Zakharov and structural results for $n = 2,3$ were established. In this article we explore the construction for $n = 4$ and prove a tropical analogue of Donagi's theorem which states that the tetragonal construction is a triality which preserves Prym varieties. This confirms the speculations in previous work and establishes new results on the non-injectivity of the tropical Prym-Torelli morphism. Finally, we demonstrate that the tropical $n$-gonal construction is poorly behaved under edge contractions, thus preventing any immediate moduli-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a relatively simple characterization of simplicial $d$-spheres on $d+4$ vertices; our criteria are in terms of the intersection patterns of a simplicial complex's minimal non-faces. Namely, let $\Sigma$ be a simplicial complex with vertex set $[d+4]$ and let $\mathcal{F}=\{A_0,\ldots, A_{n-1}\}$ be its family of minimal non-faces, indices taken in $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Then $\Sigma$ is a $d$-sphere if and only if the following hold: $n\geq 3$ is odd, successive $A_i$ are disjoint, and the alternating $(\frac{n-1}{2})$-fold intersections $A_i\cap A_{i+2} \cap A_{i+4} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i+n-3}$ partition $[d+4]$.</description>

      <title>A simple layered-wheel-like construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in characterizing the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth and pathwidth. While this has recently been resolved for pathwidth, the case of treewidth remains open, and prior work has reduced the problem to understanding the layered-wheel-like obstructions -- graphs that contain large complete minor models with each branching set inducing a path; exclude large walls as induced minors; exclude large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors; and exclude large complete subgraphs.
  There are various constructions of such graphs, but they are all rather involved. In this paper, we present a simple construction of layered-wheel-like graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. Three notable features of our construction are: (a) the vertices of degree at least four can be made to be arbitrarily far apart; (b) the girth can be made to be arbitrarily large; and (c) every outerstring induced subgraph of the graphs from our construction has treewidth bounded by an absolute constant. In contrast, among several previously known constructions of layered wheels, none achieves (a); at most one satisfies either (b) or (c); and none satisfies both (b) and (c) simultaneously.
  In particular, this is related to a former conjecture of Trotignon, that every graph with large enough treewidth, excluding large walls and large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors, and large complete subgraphs, must contain an outerstring induced subgraph of large treewidth. Our construction provides the first counterexample to this conjecture that can also be made to have arbitrarily large girth.</description>

      <title>On the multiplicity of 1 as a Laplacian eigenvalue of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with $p(G)$ pendant vertices and $q(G)$ quasi-pendant vertices. Denote by $m_{L(G)}(\lambda)$ the multiplicity of $\lambda$ as a Laplacian eigenvalue of $G$. Let $\overline{G}$ be the reduced graph of $G$, which can be obtained from $G$ by deleting some pendant vertices such that $p(\overline{G})=q(\overline{G})$. We first prove that $m_{L(G)}(1)=p(G)-q(G)+m_{L(\overline{G})}(1)$. Since deleting pendant path $P_3$ does not change the multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalue 1 of a graph, we further focus on reduced graphs without pendant path $P_3$. Let $T$ be a reduced tree on $n(\geq 6)$ vertices without pendant path $P_3$, then it is proved that $$m_{L(T)}(1)\leq \frac{n-6}{4},$$ and all the trees attaining the upper bound are characterized completely. As an application, for a reduced unicyclic graph $G$ of order $n\geq 10$ without pendant path $P_3$, we get $$m_{L(G)}(1)\leq \frac{n}{4},$$ and all the unicyclic graphs attaining the upper bound are determined completely.</description>

      <title>A proof of the $q$-Foulkes conjecture for Gaussian coefficients when $a$ divides $c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foulkes' conjecture has several generalisations due to Doran, Abdesselam--Chipalkatti, Bergeron, and Troyka. For the special linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$, these assert that given $a \le c \le d \le b$ with $ab=cd$, the $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representation $\mathrm{Sym}^a\mathrm{Sym}^b\mathbb{C}^2$ is a subrepresentation of $\mathrm{Sym}^c\mathrm{Sym}^d\mathbb{C}^2$. We present a short proof in the case where $a$ divides $c$ or $d$, which includes all prime values of $a$. This is the first proof in this family of conjectures valid for infinitely many values of $a$; previously only the cases $a=2$ and $a=3$ were known.</description>

      <title>An order-theoretic circuit syntax and characterisation of the concept lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take an order-theoretic approach to circuit (string diagram) syntax, treating a circuit as a partial order with additional input-output structure. We define morphisms between circuits and prove a factorisation theorem showing that these can, in the finite case, be regarded as formalising a notion of syntactical circuit rewrites, with quotient maps in particular corresponding to gate composition. We then consider the connectivity of a circuit, expressed as a binary relation between its inputs and outputs, and characterise the concept lattice from formal concept analysis as the unique smallest circuit that admits morphisms from all other circuits with the same connectivity. This has significance for quantum causality, particularly to the study of causal decompositions of unitary transformations. We close by constructing the circuit characterised by the dual statement.</description>

      <title>Comparing the $\mathrm{v}$-number and $h$-polynomials of edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the $\mathrm{v}$-numbers and the degree of the $h$-polynomials associated with edge ideals of connected graphs. We prove that the $\mathrm{v}$-number can be arbitrarily larger or smaller than the degree of the $h$-polynomial for the edge ideal of a connected graph. We also establish that for any pair of positive integers $(v,d)$ with $v \leq d$, there exists a connected graph $H(v,d)$ with the $\mathrm{v}$-number equal to $v$ and the degree of $h$-polynomial equal to $d$. Additionally, we show that the sum of the $\mathrm{v}$-number and the degree of the $h$-polynomial is bounded above by $n$, the number of vertices of $G$, and we classify all graphs for which this sum is exactly $n$. Finally, we show that all thirteen possible inequalities among the three invariants, the $\mathrm{v}$-number, the degree of the $h$-polynomial, and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, can occur in the case of edge ideals of connected graphs. Many of these examples rely on a minimal example of a graph whose $\mathrm{v}$-number is more than the degree of its $h$-polynomial. Using a computer search, we show that there are exactly two such graphs on 11 vertices and 25 edges, and no smaller example on fewer vertices, or 11 vertices and less than 25 edges.</description>

      <title>Discrete Boltzmann distributions via multisets and their coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the combinatorics that gives rise to the Boltzmann probability distribution. Despite being one of the most important distributions in physics and other fields of science, the mathematics of the underlying model of particles at different energy levels is underexplored. This paper gives a reconstruction, using multisets with fixed sums as mathematical representations. Counting (the coefficients of) such multisets gives a general description of binomial, trinomial, quadrinomial etc.\ coefficients, here called N-nomials. These coefficients give rise to multiple discrete Boltzmann distributions that are linked to explanations in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Largest zero-dimensional intersection of $r$ degree $d$ hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose we have $r$ hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^m$ of degree $d$, whose defining polynomials are linearly independent, and their intersection has dimension $0$. Then what is the largest possible intersection of the $r$ hypersurfaces? We conjecture an exact formula for this problem and prove it when $m=2$. We show that this can be used to compute the generalized hamming weights of the projective Reed-Muller code $\operatorname{PRM}_q(d,2)$ and hence settle a conjecture of Beelen, Datta and Ghorpade for $m=2$.</description>

      <title>Minimal balanced collections and their applications to core stability and other topics of game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal balanced collections are a generalization of partitions of a finite set of n elements and have important applications in cooperative game theory and discrete mathematics. However, their number is not known beyond n = 4. In this paper we investigate the problem of generating minimal balanced collections and implement the Peleg algorithm, permitting to generate all minimal balanced collections till n = 7. Secondly, we provide practical algorithms to check many properties of coalitions and games, based on minimal balanced collections, in a way which is faster than linear programming-based methods. In particular, we construct an algorithm to check if the core of a cooperative game is a stable set in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern. The algorithm implements a theorem according to which the core is a stable set if and only if a certain nested balancedness condition is valid. The second level of this condition requires generalizing the notion of balanced collection to balanced sets.</description>

      <title>Entrywise transforms preserving matrix positivity and non-positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize real and complex functions which, when applied entrywise to square matrices, yield a positive definite matrix if and only if the original matrix is positive definite. We refer to these transformations as sign preservers. Compared to classical work on entrywise preservers of Schoenberg and others, we completely resolve this problem in the harder fixed dimensional setting, extending a similar recent classification of sign preservers obtained for matrices over finite fields. When the matrix dimension is fixed and at least $3$, we show that the sign preservers are precisely the positive scalar multiples of the continuous automorphisms of the underlying field. This is in contrast to the $2 \times 2$ case where the sign preservers are extensions of power functions. These results are built on our classification of $2 \times 2$ entrywise positivity preservers over broader complex domains. Our results yield a complementary connection with a work of Belton, Guillot, Khare, and Putinar (2023) on negativity-preserving transforms. We also extend our sign preserver results to matrices with a structure of zeros, as studied by Guillot, Khare, and Rajaratnam for the entrywise positivity preserver problem. Finally, in the spirit of sign preservers, we address a natural extension to monotone maps, classically studied by Loewner and many others.</description>

As applications, we derive bounds for additive energies and sumsets. We also investigate the non-diagonal regime $p\neq q$, providing necessary conditions for the inequality to hold, along with partial results in the case $r = 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study a collection of matroid isomorphism games corresponding to various axiomatic characterizations of matroids. These are nonlocal games played between two cooperative players. Each game is played on two matroids, and the matroids are isomorphic if and only if the game has a perfect classical winning strategy. We define notions of quantum isomorphism in terms of perfect quantum commuting strategies, and we find a pair of nonisomorphic matroids that are quantum isomorphic. We also give a purely algebraic characterization of quantum isomorphic matroids. Finally, we use this notion of quantum isomorphism to describe a new type of quantum automorphism group of a matroid and derive a sufficient condition for a matroid to have nonclassical quantum automorphism.</description>

Abstract: Katona and Varga showed that for any rational number $t \in (1/2,1]$, no chordal graph is minimally $t$-tough, while Katona and Khan characterized all minimally $t$-tough, chordal graphs with $t \le 1/2$. We conjecture that no chordal graph is minimally $t$-tough for any $t&gt;1$ and prove several results supporting the conjecture. In particular, we show that for any $t&gt;1/2$, no strongly chordal graph is minimally $t$-tough%, no split graph is minimally $t$-tough, and no chordal graph with a universal vertex is minimally $t$-tough.</description>

Abstract: A common problem in graph colouring seeks to decompose the edge set of a given graph into few similar and simple subgraphs, under certain divisibility conditions. In 1987 Wormald conjectured that the edges of every cubic graph on $4n$ vertices can be partitioned into two isomorphic linear forests. We prove this conjecture for large connected cubic graphs. Our proof uses a wide range of probabilistic tools in conjunction with intricate structural analysis, and introduces a variety of local recolouring techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1999, Pitman and Stanley introduced the polytope bearing their name along with a study of its faces, lattice points, and volume. The Pitman-Stanley polytope is well-studied due to its connections to probability, parking functions, the generalized permutahedra, and flow polytopes. Its lattice points correspond to plane partitions of skew shape with entries 0 and 1. Pitman and Stanley remarked that their polytope can be generalized so that lattice points correspond to plane partitions of skew shape with entries $0,1, \ldots , m$. Since then, this generalization has been untouched. We study this generalization and show that it can also be realized as a flow polytope of a grid graph. We give multiple characterizations of its vertices in terms of plane partitions of skew shape and integer flows. For a fixed skew shape, we show that the number of vertices of this polytope is a polynomial in $m$ whose leading term, in certain cases, counts standard Young tableaux of a shifted shape. Moreover, we give formulas for the number of faces, as well as generating functions for the number of vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve an algebraic version of Schoenberg's celebrated theorem [Duke Math.J., 1942] characterizing entrywise matrix transforms that preserve positive definiteness. Compared to the classical real and complex settings, we consider matrices with entries in a finite field and obtain a complete characterization of such preservers for matrices of a fixed dimension. When the dimension of the matrices is at least $3$, we prove that, surprisingly, the positivity preservers are precisely the positive multiples of the field's automorphisms. We also obtain characterizations of preservers for matrices of dimension $2$ over a finite field with $q$ elements, unless $q \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $q$ is not a square. Our proofs build on several novel connections between positivity preservers and field automorphisms via the works of Weil, Carlitz, and Muzychuk-Kov\'acs, and via the structure of cliques in Paley graphs.</description>

      <title>Quasisymmetric Schur $Q$-functions and peak Young quasisymmetric Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between quasisymmetric Schur $Q$-functions and peak Young quasisymmetric Schur functions. We introduce a bijection on $\mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)$ such that $\{\mathrm{w}_{\rm c}(T) \mid T \in \mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)\}$ and $\{\mathrm{w}_{\rm r}(T) \mid T \in \mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)\}$ share identical descent distributions. Here, $\mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)$ is the set of standard peak immaculate tableaux of shape $\alpha$, and $\mathrm{w}_{\rm c}$ and $\mathrm{w}_{\rm r}$ denote column reading and row reading, respectively. By combining this equidistribution with the algorithm developed by Allen, Hallam, and Mason, we demonstrate that the transition matrix from the basis of quasisymmetric Schur $Q$-functions to the basis of peak Young quasisymmetric Schur functions is upper triangular, with entries being non-negative integers. Furthermore, we provide explicit descriptions of the expansion of peak Young quasisymmetric Schur functions in specific cases, in terms of quasisymmetric Schur $Q$-functions. We also investigate the combinatorial properties of standard peak immaculate tableaux, standard Young composition tableaux, and standard peak Young composition tableaux. We provide a hook length formula for $\mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)$ and show that standard Young composition tableaux and standard peak Young composition tableaux can be bijectively mapped to specific words in a familiar form. Especially, cases of compositions with rectangular shape are examined in detail.</description>

      <title>Keys and Evacuation via Virtualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relation between the key map and virtualization of crystals. Namely, we prove that virtualization between crystals in any two finite Cartan types commutes with the left and right key maps, thus embedding Demazure crystals and atoms correspondingly. In particular, this implies that the key map in any finite Cartan type can be reduced to the key map in a simply-laced type, provided an appropriate virtualization exists, generalizing the work of Azenhas--Santos. As an application, we study these maps in the context of orthogonal Kashiwara--Nakashima tableaux and show that the virtualizations from type B into C considered independently by Fujita and Pappe--Pfannerer--Schilling--Simone coincide with the splitting map of De Concini and Lecouvey. As a consequence, this enables us to give a new and purely combinatorial definition of orthogonal evacuation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Lower Bounds for the Feedback Arc Set Problem in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a directed graph, the Minimal Feedback Arc Set (FAS) problem asks for a minimal set of arcs in a directed graph, which, when removed, results in an acyclic graph. Equivalently, the FAS problem asks to find an ordering of the vertices that minimizes the number of feedback arcs. This is considered an algorithmic problem of central importance in discrete mathematics, with varied applications to problems in computer science and operations research. Berger and Shor, in 1990, developed upper bounds for the FAS problem in general directed graphs. Here we find asymptotic lower bounds for the FAS problem in a class of random graphs given by the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model G(n,M), with n vertices and M (undirected) edges, the latter randomly chosen. Each edge is then randomly given a direction to form our directed graph. Our interest is in developing a $\textit{lower}$ bound for the minimal feedback arc set that holds with probability 1 as $n\rightarrow \infty$. We show that $$Pr\left(\textbf{Y}^* \le M \left( \frac{1}{2} -\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{2\Delta_{av}}}\right)\right)$$ approaches zero exponentially in $n$, with $\textbf{Y}^*$ the (random) size of the minimal feedback set and $\Delta_{av}=M/n$ the average vertex degree.
  We subsequently apply our lower bounds to a set of experimental FAS data on related random graphs, as developed by Kathrin Hanauer. Not only does our formula provide a reasonably close lower bound for the minimal set, but the approximation that lies midway between our lower bound and the obvious upper bound of $M/2$ is remarkably close to the computed FAS data over a range of experiments, suggesting that this approximation may in fact be asymptotic to the minimal number of feedback arcs, for large $n$, and an excellent estimate even for moderate values.</description>

      <title>Equivalence classes of lower and upper descent weak Bruhat intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Int}(n)$ denote the set of nonempty left weak Bruhat intervals in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$. We investigate the equivalence relation $\overset{D}{\simeq}$ on $\mathrm{Int}(n)$, where $I \overset{D}{\simeq} J$ if and only if there exists a descent-preserving poset isomorphism between $I$ and $J$. For each equivalence class $C$ of $(\mathrm{Int}(n), \overset{D}{\simeq})$, a partial order $\preceq$ is defined by $[\sigma, \rho]_L \preceq [\sigma', \rho']_L$ if and only if $\sigma \preceq_R \sigma'$. Kim-Lee-Oh (2023) showed that the poset $(C, \preceq)$ is isomorphic to a right weak Bruhat interval.
  In this paper, we focus on lower and upper descent weak Bruhat intervals, specifically those of the form $[w_0(S), \sigma]_L$ or $[\sigma, w_1(S)]_L$, where $w_0(S)$ is the longest element in the parabolic subgroup $\mathfrak{S}_S$ of $\mathfrak{S}_n$, generated by $\{s_i \mid i \in S\}$ for a subset $S \subseteq [n-1]$, and $w_1(S)$ is the longest element among the minimal-length representatives of left $\mathfrak{S}_{[n-1] \setminus S}$-cosets in $\mathfrak{S}_n$. We begin by providing a poset-theoretic characterization of the equivalence relation $\overset{D}{\simeq}$. Using this characterization, the minimal and maximal elements within an equivalence class $C$ are identified when $C$ is a lower or upper descent interval. Under an additional condition, a detailed description of the structure of $(C, \preceq)$ is provided. Furthermore, for the equivalence class containing $[w_0(S), \sigma]_L$, an injective hull of ${\sf B}([w_0(S), \sigma]_L)$ is given, and for the equivalence class containing $[\sigma, w_1(S)]_L$, a projective cover of ${\sf B}([\sigma, w_1(S)]_L)$ is given.</description>

      <title>4-tangrams are 4-avoidable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tangram is a word in which every letter occurs an even number of times. Thus it can be cut into parts that can be arranged into two identical words. The \emph{cut number} of a tangram is the minimum number of required cuts in this process. Tangrams with cut number one corresponds to squares. For $k\ge1$, let $t(k)$ denote the minimum size of an alphabet over which an infinite word avoids tangrams with cut number at most~$k$. The existence of infinite ternary square-free words shows that $t(1)=t(2)=3$. We show that $t(3)=t(4)=4$, answering a question from D\k{e}bski, Grytczuk, Pawlik, Przyby\l{}o, and \'Sleszy\'nska-Nowak.</description>

      <title>Exploring the unleaved tree of numerical semigroups up to a given genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm to explore or count the numerical semigroups of a given genus which uses the unleaved version of the tree of numerical semigroups. In the unleaved tree there are no leaves rather than the ones at depth equal to the genus in consideration. For exloring the unleaved tree we present a new encoding system of a numerical semigroup given by the gcd of its left elements and its shrinking, that is, the semigroup generated by its left elements divided by their gcd. We show a method to determine the right generators and strong generators of a semigroup by means of the gcd and the shrinking encoding, as well as a method to encode a semigroup from the encoding of its parent or of its predecessor sibling. With the new algorithm we obtained $n_{76}=29028294421710227$ and $n_{77}=47008818196495180$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any $\Delta \geq 3$, there is no bound computable from $(\varepsilon, r)$ on the size of a graph required to approximate a graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ up to $\varepsilon$ error in $r$-neighborhood statistics. This provides a negative answer to a question posed by Lov\'asz. Our result is a direct consequence of the recent celebrated work of Bowen, Chapman, Lubotzky, and Vidick, which refutes the Aldous--Lyons conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices'', an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle. The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</description>

      <title>Connectivity of a Family of Bilateral Agreement Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilateral agreement based random undirected graphs were introduced and analyzed by La and Kabkab in 2015. The construction of the graph with $n$ vertices in this model uses a (random) preference order on other $n-1$ vertices and each vertex only prefers the top $k$ other vertices using its own preference order; in general, $k$ can be a function of $n$. An edge is constructed in the ensuing graph if and only if both vertices of a potential edge prefer each other. This random graph is a generalization of the random $k^{th}$-nearest neighbor graphs of Cooper and Frieze that only consider unilateral preferences of the vertices. Moharrami \emph{et al.} studied the emergence of a giant component and its size in this new random graph family in the limit of $n$ going to infinity when $k$ is finite. Connectivity properties of this random graph family have not yet been formally analyzed. In their original paper, La and Kabkab conjectured that for $k(t)=t \log n$, with high probability connectivity happens at $t&gt;1$ and the graph is disconnected for $t&lt;1$. We provide a proof for this conjecture. We will also introduce an asymptotic for the average degree of this graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new explicit connections between classical (scalar) and matrix Gegenbauer polynomials, which result in new symmetries of the latter and further give access to several properties that have been out of reach before: generating functions, distribution of zeros for individual entries of the matrices and new type of differential-difference structure. We further speculate about other potentials of the connection formulas found. Part of our proofs makes use of creative telescoping in a matrix setting$-$the strategy which is not yet developed algorithmically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are useful in representing the evolutionary history of taxa. In certain scenarios, one requires a way to compare different networks. In practice, this can be rather difficult, except within specific classes of networks. In this paper, we derive metrics for the class of \emph{orchard networks} and the class of \emph{strongly reticulation-visible} networks, from variants of so-called \emph{$\mu$-representations}, which are vector representations of networks. For both network classes, we impose degree constraints on the vertices, by considering \emph{semi-binary} networks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the harmonic descent chain and applications to critical beta-splitting trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the connection to a probabilistic model of phylogenetic trees introduced by Aldous, we study the recursive sequence governed by the rule $x_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{h_{n-1}(n-i)} x_i$ where $h_{n-1} = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1/j$, known as the harmonic descent chain. While it is known that this sequence converges to an explicit limit $x$, not much is known about the rate of convergence. We first show that a class of recursive sequences including the above are decreasing and use this to bound the rate of convergence. Moreover, for the harmonic descent chain we prove the asymptotic $x_n - x = n^{-\gamma_* + o(1)}$ for an implicit exponent $\gamma_*$. As a consequence, we deduce central limit theorems for various statistics of the critical beta-splitting random tree. This answers a number of questions of Aldous, Janson, and Pittel.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy law for certain classes of phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many classes of phylogenetic networks have been proposed in the literature. A feature of several of these classes is that if one restricts a network in the class to a subset of its leaves, then the resulting network may no longer lie within this class. This has implications for their biological applicability, since some species -- which are the leaves of an underlying evolutionary network -- may be missing (e.g., they may have become extinct, or there are no data available for them) or we may simply wish to focus attention on a subset of the species. On the other hand, certain classes of networks are 'closed' when we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all phylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled networks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks that have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the number of reticulations, height, etc) bounded by some fixed value. It is easily shown that a closed subclass of phylogenetic trees is either all trees or a vanishingly small proportion of them (as the number of leaves grows). In this short paper, we explore whether this dichotomy phenomenon holds for other classes of phylogenetic networks, and their subclasses.</description>

Abstract: The BHR (Buratti-Horak-Rosa) Conjecture (2006) proposes that for every p and a multiset L of (p-1) positive integers modulo p, there exists a Hamiltonian path in the Complete Graph Kp with consecutive edge lengths given by the elements of L. In this article, we outline an approach to the conjecture based on frequency partitions and local/global adjustment operations and backtracking. We describe the mathematical strategy, experimental evidence, and implementation in a Python Program to explore valid Hamiltonian paths p &lt; 37. This is a result an improvement over by Mariusz Meszka for all primes up to 23 (included) with the aid of a computer.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator systems of matrices can be viewed as quantum analogues of finite graphs. This analogy suggests many natural combinatorial questions in linear algebra. We determine the quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$ and the lower quantum Tur\'an numbers $T^\downarrow(n, m)$ with $m \geq n/4$. In particular, we conclude that $QR(2,2) = 4$ and confirm Weaver's conjecture that $T^\downarrow(4, 1) = 4$. We also obtain a new result for the existence of anticliques in quantum graphs of low dimension.</description>
