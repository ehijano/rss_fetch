      <title>Fracture toughness and auxeticity in disordered metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auxetic metamaterials are commonly thought to exhibit favorable mechanical properties, notably high energy absorption. Here we investigate disordered metamaterials obtained from random beam networks by optimizing simultaneously auxeticity and the energy absorbed before fracture. By giving different weights to these optimization targets, we demonstrate that the optimal configurations are connected along a Pareto front where high auxeticity implies comparatively low energy absorption and vice versa. We study the mechanical properties of the resulting metamaterials and characterize the different deformation modes obtained for distinct optimization targets. The simulation and optimization results are validated by comparison with the deformation behavior of additively manufactured samples. Our work provides an illustration of the potentials and limitations of multi-objective optimization in the design of disordered mechanical metamaterials</description>

      <title>A Spin Glass Characterization of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection, safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of topological zero modes on a 41-qubit superconducting processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05341v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of different exotic topological phases of quantum matter on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processor is attracting growing interest. Here, we develop a one-dimensional 43-qubit superconducting quantum processor, named as Chuang-tzu, to simulate and characterize emergent topological states. By engineering diagonal Aubry-Andr$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$-Harper (AAH) models, we experimentally demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states. Our results establish a versatile hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological systems in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06565v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the nature of hydrodynamical transport properties in quantum dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter. Experimentally simulating infinite-temperature transport on large-scale complex quantum systems is of considerable interest. Here, using a controllable and coherent superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally realize the analog quantum circuit, which can efficiently prepare the Haar-random states, and probe spin transport at infinite temperature. We observe diffusive spin transport during the unitary evolution of the ladder-type quantum simulator with ergodic dynamics. Moreover, we explore the transport properties of the systems subjected to strong disorder or a tilted potential, revealing signatures of anomalous subdiffusion in accompany with the breakdown of thermalization. Our work demonstrates a scalable method of probing infinite-temperature spin transport on analog quantum simulators, which paves the way to study other intriguing out-of-equilibrium phenomena from the perspective of transport.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence Extracts Structure-Function Relationships from Plants for New Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Randomly twisted bilayer graphene -- the cascade transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is known to have disorder in its twist angle. We show that in terms of a Dirac equation with a random gauge potential ${\bf A}({\bf r})$ this disorder becomes huge when the average twist angle is near the magic angle where the Dirac velocity vanishes. The density of states (DOS) then diverges at the Dirac point as $\rho(E)\sim E^{(2/z)-1}$ with $z\gg 1$ and we deduce that all electrons occupy energies very near $E=0$. We prove a sum rule on the disorder averaged eigenfunctions from which we deduce that each added electron contributes equal intraband Coulomb interaction energy. The various bands in TBG are related by either ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow {\bf A}({-\bf r})$ or ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow -{\bf A}({\bf r})$ which affects the interband interaction energy. We find, within Hartree-Fock, jumps in the chemical potential at each integer filling, accounting for the cascade transitions.</description>

      <title>Aging in a two-dimensional swarmalator crystal with delayed interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delay can have a significant impact on the properties of collective organization of active matter. In the previous paper [1], we discussed delay-induced breathing in a system of swarmalators - a model coupling particles' internal phases to spatial interactions. Here we build on that study to investigate the aging phenomenon in this system. It is the aging of a two-dimensional crystal with defects and inhomogeneous lattice constants, and takes place after the breathing transients subside. We show that aging proceeds through the gradual elimination of five-fold and seven-fold coordination number defects, which merge pairwise or migrate to the cluster boundary, incrementally increasing the hexatic order parameter in the bulk. Despite this process, defects usually do not fully disappear; some residual number of defects remain frozen in the interior. However, we found that it is possible to achieve a nearly total elimination of coordination number defects at sufficiently low delay - when the surface of the cluster develops a sufficeintly thick fluidized ``boiling layer''. This mechanism of boundary-mediated annealing reveals a non-equilibrium pathway to achieving high crystalline order in the bulk, and raises a tantalizing possibility for controlling defects in active matter with free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Estimating classical mutual information between quantum subsystems with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing correlations in a quantum system on the basis of the results of the projective measurements can be performed with different means including the calculation of the classical mutual information. Generally, estimating such information-entropy-based quantities requires having complete statistics of the system's states. Here we explore the possibility to reconstruct the classical mutual information and specific entropy of a quantum system with neural network approach on the basis of limited number of projective measurements. As a prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space. In addition, the phase diagram of the considered quantum system is reconstructed with a special focus on discriminating various types of disordered states.</description>

      <title>Observation and Modulation of the Quantum Mpemba Effect on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) emerges as a counterintuitive phenomenon: systems exhibiting greater initial symmetry breaking restore symmetry faster than those with less. While theoretical exploration of QME has surged, experimental studies on its multidimensional modulation remain limited. Here, we report the observation and control of QME using a superconducting processor featuring a unique fully connected, tunable-coupling architecture that enables precise modulation from short- to long-range interactions. This platform allows independent manipulation of coupling regimes, on-site potentials, and initial states, elucidating their roles in QME. To quantify symmetry restoration, we employ entanglement asymmetry (EA) -- the relative entropy between a subsystem reduced density matrix and its symmetric projection -- as a sensitive probe of symmetry breaking. In strong short-range coupling regimes, EA crossovers during quenches from tilted N\'{e}el states confirm the presence of QME. In contrast, in intermediate coupling regimes, synchronized EA and entanglement entropy dynamics reveal the suppression of QME. Remarkably, QME reemerges with the introduction of on-site linear potentials or quenches from tilted ferromagnetic states, the latter proving robust against on-site disorder. Our study provides the first demonstration of flexible QME modulation on a superconducting platform with multiple controllable parameters, shedding light on quantum many-body non-equilibrium dynamics and opening avenues for quantum information applications.</description>

Abstract: In these notes we discuss tools and concepts that emerge when studying high-dimensional random landscapes, i.e., random functions on high-dimensional spaces. As an illustrative example, we consider an inference problem in two forms: low-rank matrix estimation (Case 1) and low-rank tensor estimation (Case 2). We show how to map the inference problem onto the optimization problem of a high-dimensional landscape, which exhibits distinct geometrical properties in the two cases. We discuss methods for characterizing typical realizations of these landscapes and their optimization through local dynamics. We conclude by highlighting connections between the landscape problem and Large Deviation Theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} models featuring tunable quasidisordered potentials and a mobility edge that separates extended and localized states, with critical states for the mobility edge confirmed through finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical results demonstrate that extended, critical, and localized states can be distinguished via their phase-space representations, particularly the Wigner distribution. The associated Wigner entropy, derived from this distribution, peaks at the critical state, enabling precise localization of the mobility edge. Additionally, wave-packet dynamics reveal anomalous transport behaviors, including superdiffusion and subdiffusion, bridging ballistic transport and the absence of diffusion.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here, we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called alpha and beta relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the alpha process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a beta process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (alpha) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no beta relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective.</description>

Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schr\"odinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.</description>
