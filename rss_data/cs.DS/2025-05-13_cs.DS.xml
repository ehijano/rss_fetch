      <title>An Improved Algorithm for a Bipartite Traveling Tournament in Interleague Sports Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bipartite traveling tournament problem (BTTP) addresses inter-league sports scheduling, which aims to design a feasible bipartite tournament between two $n$-team leagues under some constraints such that the total traveling distance of all participating teams is minimized. Since its introduction, several methods have been developed to design feasible schedules for NBA, NPB and so on. In terms of solution quality with a theoretical guarantee, previously only a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation is known for the case that $n\equiv 0 \pmod 3$. Whether there are similar results for the cases that $n\equiv 1 \pmod 3$ and $n\equiv 2 \pmod 3$ was asked in the literature. In this paper, we answer this question positively by proposing a $(3/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for any $n$ and any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, which also improves the previous approximation ratio for the case that $n\equiv 0 \pmod 3$.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguring Multiple Connected Components with Size Multiset Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel generalization of Independent Set Reconfiguration (ISR): Connected Components Reconfiguration (CCR). In CCR, we are given a graph $G$, two vertex subsets $A$ and $B$, and a multiset $\mathcal{M}$ of positive integers. The question is whether $A$ and $B$ are reconfigurable under a certain rule, while ensuring that each vertex subset induces connected components whose sizes match the multiset $\mathcal{M}$. ISR is a special case of CCR where $\mathcal{M}$ only contains 1. We also propose new reconfiguration rules: component jumping (CJ) and component sliding (CS), which regard connected components as tokens. Since CCR generalizes ISR, the problem is PSPACE-complete. In contrast, we show three positive results: First, CCR-CS and CCR-CJ are solvable in linear and quadratic time, respectively, when $G$ is a path. Second, we show that CCR-CS is solvable in linear time for cographs. Third, when $\mathcal{M}$ contains only the same elements (i.e., all connected components have the same size), we show that CCR-CJ is solvable in linear time if $G$ is chordal. The second and third results generalize known results for ISR and exhibit an interesting difference between the reconfiguration rules.</description>

      <title>Improved Mixing of Critical Hardcore Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hardcore model is one of the most classic and widely studied examples of undirected graphical models. Given a graph $G$, the hardcore model describes a Gibbs distribution of $\lambda$-weighted independent sets of $G$. In the last two decades, a beautiful computational phase transition has been established at a precise threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta)$ where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree, where the task of sampling independent sets transfers from polynomial-time solvable to computationally intractable. We study the critical hardcore model where $\lambda = \lambda_c(\Delta)$ and show that the Glauber dynamics, a simple yet popular Markov chain algorithm, mixes in $\tilde{O}(n^{7.44 + O(1/\Delta)})$ time on any $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $\Delta\geq3$, significantly improving the previous upper bound $\tilde{O}(n^{12.88+O(1/\Delta)})$ by the recent work arXiv:2411.03413. The core property we establish in this work is that the critical hardcore model is $O(\sqrt{n})$-spectrally independent, improving the trivial bound of $n$ and matching the critical behavior of the Ising model. Our proof approach utilizes an online decision-making framework to study a site percolation model on the infinite $(\Delta-1)$-ary tree, which can be interesting by itself.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Locality Testing via Trotterized Postselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (tolerant) Hamiltonian locality testing problem, introduced in [Bluhm, Caro,Oufkir `24], is to determine whether a Hamiltonian $H$ is $\varepsilon_1$-close to being $k$-local (i.e. can be written as the sum of weight-$k$ Pauli operators) or $\varepsilon_2$-far from any $k$-local Hamiltonian, given access to its time evolution operator and using as little total evolution time as possible, with distance typically defined by the normalized Frobenius norm. We give the tightest known bounds for this problem, proving an $\text{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_2}{(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1)^5}}\right)$ evolution time upper bound and an $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1}\right)$ lower bound. Our algorithm does not require reverse time evolution or controlled application of the time evolution operator, although our lower bound applies to algorithms using either tool.
  Furthermore, we show that if we are allowed reverse time evolution, this lower bound is tight, giving a matching $\text{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1}\right)$ evolution time algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generic vector memory based accelerator is considered which supports DIT and DIF FFT with fixed datapath. The regular mixed-radix factorization of the DFT matrix coherent with the accelerator architecture is proposed and the correction proof is presented. It allows better understanding of architecture requirements and simplifies the developing and proving correctness of more complicated algorithms and conflict-free addressing schemes.</description>

      <title>Exact Spin Elimination in Ising Hamiltonians and Energy-Based Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact spin-elimination technique that reduces the dimensionality of both quadratic and k-local Ising Hamiltonians while preserving their original ground-state configurations. By systematically replacing each removed spin with an effective interaction among its neighbors, our method lowers the total spin count without invoking approximations or iterative recalculations. This capability is especially beneficial for hardware-constrained platforms, classical or quantum, that can directly implement multi-body interactions but have limited qubit or spin resources. We demonstrate three key advances enabled by this technique. First, we handle larger instances of benchmark problems such as Max-Cut on cubic graphs without exceeding a 2-local interaction limit. Second, we reduce qubit requirements in QAOA-based integer factorization on near-term quantum devices, thus extending the feasible range of integers to be factorized. Third, we improve memory capacity in Hopfield associative memories and enhance memory retrieval by suppressing spurious attractors, enhancing retrieval performance. Our spin-elimination procedure trades local spin complexity for higher-order couplings or higher node degrees in a single pass, opening new avenues for scaling up combinatorial optimization and energy-based machine learning on near-term hardware. Finally, these results underscore that the next-generation physical spin machines will likely capitalize on k-local spin Hamiltonians to offer an alternative to classical computations.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for the Expanding Search Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A searcher is tasked with exploring a graph with edge lengths and vertex weights, starting from a designated vertex. Initially, only the starting vertex is considered explored. At each step, the searcher adds an edge to the solution, connecting an unexplored vertex to an explored one. The time required to add an edge equals its length. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of exploration times for all vertices. We demonstrate that this problem is hard to approximate and present algorithms with improved approximation guarantees. Specifically, we provide a $(2\mathrm{e} + \varepsilon)$-approximation for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for the general case. On instances where the vertex weights are binary, we achieve a $2\mathrm{e}$-approximation. Finally, we develop a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for Euclidean graphs. Previously, only an $8$-approximation was known for all these cases.</description>

      <title>New Algorithms for Incremental Minimum Spanning Trees and Temporal Graph Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Processing graphs with temporal information (the temporal graphs) has become increasingly important in the real world. In this paper, we study efficient solutions to temporal graph applications using new algorithms for Incremental Minimum Spanning Trees (MST). The first contribution of this work is to formally discuss how a broad set of setting-problem combinations of temporal graph processing can be solved using incremental MST, along with their theoretical guarantees. Despite the importance of the problem, we observe a gap between theory and practice for efficient incremental MST algorithms. While many classic data structures, such as the link-cut tree, provide strong bounds for incremental MST, their performance is limited in practice. Meanwhile, existing practical solutions used in applications do not have any non-trivial theoretical guarantees. Our second and main contribution includes new algorithms for incremental MST that are efficient both in theory and in practice. Our new data structure, the AM-tree, achieves the same theoretical bound as the link-cut tree for temporal graph processing and shows strong performance in practice. In our experiments, the AM-tree has competitive or better performance than existing practical solutions due to theoretical guarantees, and can be significantly faster than the link-cut tree (7.8-11x in updates and 7.7-13.7x in queries).</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Representation of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel normal form representation of Boolean functions in terms of products of binary matrices, hereafter referred to as the Binary Matrix Product (BMP) representation. BMPs are analogous to the Tensor-Trains (TT) and Matrix Product States (MPS) used, respectively, in applied mathematics and in quantum many-body physics to accelerate computations that are usually inaccessible by more traditional approaches. BMPs turn out to be closely related to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a powerful compressed representation of Boolean functions invented in the late 80s by Bryant that has found a broad range of applications in many areas of computer science and engineering. We present a direct and natural translation of BMPs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and derive an elementary set of operations used to manipulate and combine BMPs that are analogous to those introduced by Bryant for BDDs. Both BDDs and BMPs are practical tools when the complexity of these representations, as measured by the maximum bond dimension of a BMP (or the accumulated bond dimension across the BMP matrix train) and the number of nodes of a BDD, remains polynomial in the number of bits, $n$. In both cases, controlling the complexity hinges on optimizing the order of the Boolean variables. BMPs offer the advantage that their construction and manipulation rely on simple linear algebra -- a compelling feature that can facilitate the development of open-source libraries that are both more flexible and easier to use than those currently available for BDDs. An initial implementation of a BMP library is available on GitHub, with the expectation that the close conceptual connection to TT and MPS techniques will motivate further development of BMP methods by researchers in these fields, potentially enabling novel applications to classical and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the Banded Matrix Factorization Mechanism for Differentially Private ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated noise mechanisms such as DP Matrix Factorization (DP-MF) have proven to be effective alternatives to DP-SGD in large-epsilon few-epoch training regimes. Significant work has been done to find the best correlated noise strategies, and the current state-of-the-art approach is DP-BandMF, which optimally balances the benefits of privacy amplification and noise correlation. Despite it's utility advantages, severe scalability limitations prevent this mechanism from handling large-scale training scenarios where the number of training iterations may exceed $10^4$ and the number of model parameters may exceed $10^7$. In this work, we present techniques to scale up DP-BandMF along these two dimensions, significantly extending it's reach and enabling it to handle settings with virtually any number of model parameters and training iterations, with negligible utility degradation.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic aspects of semistability of quiver representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding the semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding the maximizers of King's criterion, and computing the Harder--Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we refer to as King cones. For rank-one representations, we demonstrate that these King cones can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, enabling us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability in strongly polynomial time. Our approach employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Formally, given a mixed state $\rho$ that either has fidelity at least $\varepsilon_1$ with some stabilizer pure state or fidelity at most $\varepsilon_2$ with all such states, where $\varepsilon_2 \leq \varepsilon_1^{O(1)}$, our algorithm distinguishes the two cases with sample complexity $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$ and time complexity $O(n \cdot \text{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1))$.</description>
