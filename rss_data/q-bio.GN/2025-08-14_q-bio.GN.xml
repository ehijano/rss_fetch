      <title>Deep Generative Models for Discrete Genotype Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models open new avenues for simulating realistic genomic data while preserving privacy and addressing data accessibility constraints. While previous studies have primarily focused on generating gene expression or haplotype data, this study explores generating genotype data in both unconditioned and phenotype-conditioned settings, which is inherently more challenging due to the discrete nature of genotype data. In this work, we developed and evaluated commonly used generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and proposed adaptation tailored to discrete genotype data. We conducted extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including all chromosomes from cow and multiple chromosomes from human. Model performance was assessed using a well-established set of metrics drawn from both deep learning and quantitative genetics literature. Our results show that these models can effectively capture genetic patterns and preserve genotype-phenotype association. Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of these models and offer practical guidelines for future research in genotype simulation. We have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/SihanXXX/DiscreteGenoGen.</description>

      <title>miRKatAI: An Integrated Database and Multi-agent AI system for microRNA Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRs) are robust regulators of gene expression, implicated in most biological processes. microRNAs predominantly downregulate the expression of genes post-transcriptionally and each miR is predicted to target several hundred genes. The accurate identification and annotation of miR-mRNA target interactions is central to understanding miRs function and their therapeutic potential. However, computational target prediction is challenging due to imperfect complementarity of miRs with their targets and the growing volume and heterogeneity of experimental data present challenges in accessing, integrating, and analysing miR-target interaction information across biological contexts. This creates a need for integrated resources and intelligent query tools.
  We present the miRKat Suite, comprising miRKatDB, a comprehensive, curated database of predicted and validated miR-target interactions and associated annotations, and miRKatAI, a multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) and LangGraph. miRKatDB integrates data from multiple publicly available sources, providing a comprehensive foundation for miR studies, including miR target genes and changes in levels of tissue expression previously reported. miRKatAI offers a natural language interface for complex querying of miRKatDB, facilitates grounded information retrieval from established sources in the field, and supports basic data visualisation. The miRKat Suite aims to accelerate miR research by streamlining data access, enhancing exploratory analysis, and supporting hypothesis generation.</description>
