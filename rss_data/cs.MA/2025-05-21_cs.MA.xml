      <title>HALO: Hierarchical Autonomous Logic-Oriented Orchestration for Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in diverse task scenarios. Nonetheless, existing agentic systems typically rely on predefined agent-role design spaces and static communication structures, limiting their adaptability as well as flexibility in complex interaction environments and leading to subpar performance on highly specialized and expert-level tasks. To address these issues, we introduce HALO, a multi-agent collaboration framework based on a hierarchical reasoning architecture. Specifically, we incorporate a high-level planning agent for task decomposition, mid-level role-design agents for subtask-specific agent instantiation, and low-level inference agents for subtask execution. Particularly, subtask execution is reformulated as a structured workflow search problem, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) systematically explores the agentic action space to construct optimal reasoning trajectories. Additionally, as the majority of users lack expertise in prompt engineering, we leverage an Adaptive Prompt Refinement module to transform raw queries into task-specific prompts. Empirical evaluations on Code Generation (HumanEval), General Reasoning (MMLU), and Arithmetic Reasoning (MATH) benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of HALO, yielding a 14.4% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, HALO achieves up to 13.3% performance gain on the Moral Scenarios subject in the MMLU benchmark and up to 19.6% performance gain on the Algebra subarea in the MATH benchmark, indicating its advanced proficiency in tackling highly specialized and expert-level tasks.

      <title>ACPs: Agent Collaboration Protocols for the Internet of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, the proliferation of autonomous agents has introduced new challenges in interoperability, scalability, and coordination. The Internet of Agents (IoA) aims to interconnect heterogeneous agents through standardized communication protocols, enabling seamless collaboration and intelligent task execution. However, existing agent communication protocols such as MCP, A2A, and ANP remain fragmented and scenario-specific. To address this gap, we propose Agent Collaboration Protocols (ACPs), a comprehensive protocol suite for the IoA. ACPs include registration, discovery, interaction, and tooling protocols to support trustable access, capability orchestration, and workflow construction. We present the architecture, key technologies, and application workflows of ACPs, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a collaborative restaurant booking scenario. ACPs lay the foundation for building a secure, open, and scalable agent internet infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Origin-Destination Pattern Effects on Large-Scale Mixed Traffic Control via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a major challenge for modern urban transportation, diminishing both efficiency and quality of life. While autonomous driving technologies and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise for improving traffic control, most prior work has focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections. Large-scale mixed traffic control, involving both human-driven and robotic vehicles, remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for managing large-scale mixed traffic networks, where intersections are controlled either by traditional traffic signals or by robotic vehicles. We evaluate our approach on a real-world network of 14 intersections in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA, using average vehicle waiting time as the primary measure of traffic efficiency. Results demonstrate that strategically adjusting major origin-destination (OD) flow patterns can effectively reduce congestion, offering a new pathway for enhancing urban mobility.</description>

      <title>MLZero: A Multi-Agent System for End-to-end Machine Learning Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing AutoML systems have advanced the automation of machine learning (ML); however, they still require substantial manual configuration and expert input, particularly when handling multimodal data. We introduce MLZero, a novel multi-agent framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables end-to-end ML automation across diverse data modalities with minimal human intervention. A cognitive perception module is first employed, transforming raw multimodal inputs into perceptual context that effectively guides the subsequent workflow. To address key limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinated code generation and outdated API knowledge, we enhance the iterative code generation process with semantic and episodic memory. MLZero demonstrates superior performance on MLE-Bench Lite, outperforming all competitors in both success rate and solution quality, securing six gold medals. Additionally, when evaluated on our Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark, which includes 25 more challenging tasks spanning diverse data modalities, MLZero outperforms the competing methods by a large margin with a success rate of 0.92 (+263.6\%) and an average rank of 2.28. Our approach maintains its robust effectiveness even with a compact 8B LLM, outperforming full-size systems from existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Personalized and Resilient Distributed Learning Through Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies.</description>

      <title>Empowering LLMs in Task-Oriented Dialogues: A Domain-Independent Multi-Agent Framework and Fine-Tuning Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention across various industries and achieved significant results. Current approaches condense complex procedural workflows into a single agent to achieve satisfactory performance on large-scale LLMs. However, these approaches face challenges to achieve comparable performance on fine-tuned lightweight LLMs, due to their limited capabilities in handling multiple complex logic. In this work, we design a Domain-Independent Multi-Agent Framework (DIMF), which contains Intent Classification Agent, Slot Filling Agent and Response Agent. This approach simplifies the learning complexity and enhances the generalization ability by separating the tasks into domain-independent components. In this framework, we enhance the capabilities in contextual understanding using the Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) method, and propose a simple and effective Data Distribution Adaptation (DDA) method to mitigate degradation issues during DPO training. Experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ datasets show that our proposed method achieves a better average performance among all the baselines. Extensive analysis also demonstrates that our proposed framework exhibits excellent generalizability and zero-shot capability.</description>

      <title>Modelling Real-time Systems with Bigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRSs) are a graph-rewriting formalism describing systems evolving in two dimensions: spatially, e.g. a person in a room, and non-spatially, e.g. mobile phones communicating regardless of location. Despite use in domains including communication protocols, agent programming, biology, and security, there is no support for real-time systems. We extend BRSs to support real-time systems with a modelling approach that uses multiple perspectives to represent digital clocks. We use Action BRSs, a recent extension of BRSs, where the resulting transition system is a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This allows a natural representation of the choices in each system state: to either allow time to pass or perform a specific action. We implement our proposed approach using the BigraphER toolkit, and demonstrate the effectiveness through multiple examples including modelling cloud system requests.</description>

      <title>An agentic system with reinforcement-learned subsystem improvements for parsing form-like documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting alphanumeric data from form-like documents such as invoices, purchase orders, bills, and financial documents is often performed via vision (OCR) and learning algorithms or monolithic pipelines with limited potential for systemic improvements. We propose an agentic AI system that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents and a reinforcement learning (RL) driver agent to automate consistent, self-improving extraction under LLM inference uncertainty. Our work highlights the limitations of monolithic LLM-based extraction and introduces a modular, multi-agent framework with task-specific prompts and an RL policy of rewards and penalties to guide a meta-prompting agent to learn from past errors and improve prompt-based actor agents. This self-corrective adaptive system handles diverse documents, file formats, layouts, and LLMs, aiming to automate accurate information extraction without the need for human intervention. Results as reported on two benchmark datasets of SOIRE, and CORD, are promising for the agentic AI framework.</description>

      <title>Prompt Stability Matters: Evaluating and Optimizing Auto-Generated Prompt in General-Purpose Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic prompt generation plays a crucial role in enabling general-purpose multi-agent systems to perform diverse tasks autonomously. Existing methods typically evaluate prompts based on their immediate task performance, overlooking the intrinsic qualities that determine their reliability. This outcome-centric view not only limits interpretability but also fails to account for the inherent stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we bring attention to prompt stability-the consistency of model responses across repeated executions-as a key factor for building robust and effective prompt generation systems. To quantify this, we propose semantic stability as a criterion for assessing the response consistency of prompts, and fine-tune a LLaMA-based evaluator to measure it automatically across tasks. These components have enabled us to develop the first stability-aware general-purpose prompt generation system that leverages stability feedback to iteratively enhance both prompt quality and system-level performance. Furthermore, we establish a logical chain between prompt stability and task success by analyzing the structural dependencies within our system, proving stability as a necessary condition for effective system-level execution. Empirical results across general and domain-specific tasks demonstrate that our stability-aware framework improves both accuracy and output consistency. By shifting the focus from one-off results to persistent reliability, our work offers a new perspective on prompt design and contributes practical tools for building more trustworthy general-purpose systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Obvious Manipulability in Additively Separable and Fractional Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the design of Non-Obviously Manipulable (NOM) mechanisms, mechanisms that bounded rational agents may fail to recognize as manipulable, for two relevant classes of succinctly representable Hedonic Games: Additively Separable and Fractional Hedonic Games. In these classes, agents have cardinal scores towards other agents, and their preferences over coalitions are determined by aggregating such scores. This aggregation results in a utility function for each agent, which enables the evaluation of outcomes via the utilitarian social welfare. We first prove that, when scores can be arbitrary, every optimal mechanism is NOM; moreover, when scores are limited in a continuous interval, there exists an optimal mechanism that is NOM. Given the hardness of computing optimal outcomes in these settings, we turn our attention to efficient and NOM mechanisms. To this aim, we first prove a characterization of NOM mechanisms that simplifies the class of mechanisms of interest. Then, we design a NOM mechanism returning approximations that asymptotically match the best-known approximation achievable in polynomial time. Finally, we focus on discrete scores, where the compatibility of NOM with optimality depends on the specific values. Therefore, we initiate a systematic analysis to identify which discrete values support this compatibility and which do not.</description>

      <title>Model Cards for AI Teammates: Comparing Human-AI Team Familiarization Methods for High-Stakes Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare three methods of familiarizing a human with an artificial intelligence (AI) teammate ("agent") prior to operation in a collaborative, fast-paced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) environment. In a between-subjects user study (n=60), participants either read documentation about the agent, trained alongside the agent prior to the mission, or were given no familiarization. Results showed that the most valuable information about the agent included details of its decision-making algorithms and its relative strengths and weaknesses compared to the human. This information allowed the familiarization groups to form sophisticated team strategies more quickly than the control group. Documentation-based familiarization led to the fastest adoption of these strategies, but also biased participants towards risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores. Participants familiarized through direct interaction were able to infer much of the same information through observation, and were more willing to take risks and experiment with different control modes, but reported weaker understanding of the agent's internal processes. Significant differences were seen between individual participants' risk tolerance and methods of AI interaction, which should be considered when designing human-AI control interfaces. Based on our findings, we recommend a human-AI team familiarization method that combines AI documentation, structured in-situ training, and exploratory interaction.</description>

      <title>Divide by Question, Conquer by Agent: SPLIT-RAG with Question-Driven Graph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems empower large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, yet struggle with efficiency-accuracy trade-offs when scaling to large knowledge graphs. Existing approaches often rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>MAS-KCL: Knowledge component graph structure learning with large language model-based agentic workflow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) are the fundamental units of knowledge in the field of education. A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies between KCs. An accurate KC graph can assist educators in identifying the root causes of learners' poor performance on specific KCs, thereby enabling targeted instructional interventions. To achieve this, we have developed a KC graph structure learning algorithm, named MAS-KCL, which employs a multi-agent system driven by large language models for adaptive modification and optimization of the KC graph. Additionally, a bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated into the algorithm, where AI agents leverage this mechanism to assess the value of edges within the KC graph and adjust the distribution of generation probabilities for different edges, thereby accelerating the efficiency of structure learning. We applied the proposed algorithm to 5 synthetic datasets and 4 real-world educational datasets, and experimental results validate its effectiveness in learning path recognition. By accurately identifying learners' learning paths, teachers are able to design more comprehensive learning plans, enabling learners to achieve their educational goals more effectively, thus promoting the sustainable development of education.</description>

      <title>Upgrading Democracies with Fairer Voting Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voting methods are instrumental design element of democracies. Citizens use them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision. However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to people's voting choices. Despite the significance and inter-disciplinary scientific progress on voting methods, several democracies keep relying on outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well, while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a proportional representation of voters' preferences. By rigorously assessing a new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland, we unravel the striking voting outcomes of fair voting methods: more winning projects with the same budget and broader geographic and preference representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters who used to be under-represented, while promoting novel project ideas. We provide profound causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very technical specialized explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism and compromise. These findings come with a global momentum to unleash a new and long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning vs. Fixed-Time Control for Traffic Signal Optimization: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</description>

      <title>Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.</description>

      <title>Attention Mechanism for LLM-based Agents Dynamic Diffusion under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have been used to simulate human society using multi-agent systems. Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability, and diffusion diversity. In this paper, we first propose a general framework for exploring multi-agent information diffusion. We identified LLMs' deficiency in the perception and utilization of social relationships, as well as diverse actions. Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of the LLM attention mechanism. Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. Additionally, we explore the information diffusion features in the asymmetric open environment by observing the evolution of information gaps, diffusion patterns, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Strategy Synthesis for Swarms of Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady-state synthesis aims to construct a policy for a given MDP $D$ such that the long-run average frequencies of visits to the vertices of $D$ satisfy given numerical constraints. This problem is solvable in polynomial time, and memoryless policies are sufficient for approximating an arbitrary frequency vector achievable by a general (infinite-memory) policy.
  We study the steady-state synthesis problem for multiagent systems, where multiple autonomous agents jointly strive to achieve a suitable frequency vector. We show that the problem for multiple agents is computationally hard (PSPACE or NP hard, depending on the variant), and memoryless strategy profiles are insufficient for approximating achievable frequency vectors. Furthermore, we prove that even evaluating the frequency vector achieved by a given memoryless profile is computationally hard. This reveals a severe barrier to constructing an efficient synthesis algorithm, even for memoryless profiles. Nevertheless, we design an efficient and scalable synthesis algorithm for a subclass of full memoryless profiles, and we evaluate this algorithm on a large class of randomly generated instances. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement against a naive algorithm based on strategy sharing.</description>

      <title>IG Parser: A Software Package for the Encoding of Institutional Statements using the Institutional Grammar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of IG Parser, a software that facilitates qualitative content analysis of formal (e.g., legal) rules or informal (e.g., social) norms, and strategies (such as conventions) -- referred to as institutions -- that govern social systems and operate configurally to describe institutional systems. To this end, the IG Parser employs a distinctive syntax that ensures rigorous encoding of natural language, while automating the transformation into various formats that support the downstream analysis using diverse analytical techniques. The conceptual core of the IG Parser is an associated syntax, IG Script, that operationalizes the conceptual foundations of the Institutional Grammar, and more specifically the Institutional Grammar 2.0, an analytical paradigm for institutional analysis. This article presents the IG Parser, including its conceptual foundations, the syntax specification of IG Script, and its architectural principles. This overview is augmented with selective illustrative examples that highlight its use and the associated benefits.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Inference through Bayesian and Inverse Bayesian Inference with Symmetry-Bias in Nonstationary Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel inference framework, designated as Bayesian and inverse Bayesian (BIB) inference, which concurrently performs both conventional and inverse Bayesian updates by integrating symmetry bias into Bayesian inference. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated through a sequential estimation task involving observations sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a stochastically time-varying mean. Conventional Bayesian inference entails a fundamental trade-off between adaptability to abrupt environmental shifts and estimation accuracy during stable intervals. The BIB framework addresses this limitation by dynamically modulating the learning rate through inverse Bayesian updates, thereby enhancing adaptive flexibility. The BIB model generated spontaneous bursts in the learning rate during sudden environmental transitions, transiently entering a high-sensitivity state to accommodate incoming data. This intermittent burst-relaxation pattern functions as a dynamic mechanism that balances adaptability and accuracy. Further analysis of burst interval distributions demonstrated that the BIB model consistently produced power-law distributions under diverse conditions. Such robust scaling behavior, absent in conventional Bayesian inference, appears to emerge from a self-regulatory mechanism driven by inverse Bayesian updates. These results present a novel computational perspective on scale-free phenomena in natural systems and offer implications for designing adaptive inference systems in nonstationary environments.</description>
