      <title>Crossing penalised CAViaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic quantiles, or Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk (CAViaR) models, have been extensively studied at the individual level. However, efforts to estimate multiple dynamic quantiles jointly have been limited. Existing approaches either sequentially estimate fitted quantiles or impose restrictive assumptions on the data generating process. This paper fills this gap by proposing an objective function for the joint estimation of all quantiles, introducing a crossing penalty to guide the process. Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application on the FTSE100 validate the effectiveness of the method, offering a flexible and robust approach to modelling multiple dynamic quantiles in time-series data.</description>

      <title>Lead Times in Flux: Analyzing Airbnb Booking Dynamics During Global Upheavals (2018-2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-term shifts in booking behaviors can disrupt forecasting in the travel and hospitality industry, especially during global crises. Traditional metrics like average or median lead times often overlook important distribution changes. This study introduces a normalized L1 (Manhattan) distance to assess Airbnb booking lead time divergences from 2018 to 2022, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic across four major U.S. cities. We identify a two-phase disruption: an abrupt change at the pandemic's onset followed by partial recovery with persistent deviations from pre-2018 patterns. Our method reveals changes in travelers' planning horizons that standard statistics miss, highlighting the need to analyze the entire lead-time distribution for more accurate demand forecasting and pricing strategies. The normalized L1 metric provides valuable insights for tourism stakeholders navigating ongoing market volatility.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Limits for Nearly Unstable Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish general scaling limits for nearly unstable Hawkes processes in a mean-field regime by extending the method introduced by Jaisson and Rosenbaum. Under a mild asymptotic criticality condition on the self-exciting kernels $\{\phi^n\}$, specifically $\|\phi^n\|_{L^1} \to 1$, we first show that the scaling limits of these Hawkes processes are necessarily stochastic Volterra diffusions of affine type. Moreover, we establish a propagation of chaos result for Hawkes systems with mean-field interactions, highlighting three distinct regimes for the limiting processes, which depend on the asymptotics of $n(1-\|\phi^n\|_{L^1})^2$. These results provide a significant generalization of the findings by Delattre, Fournier and Hoffmann.</description>

      <title>Zero-Coupon Treasury Rates and Returns using the Volatility Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multivariate autoregressive stochastic volatility model for the first 3 principal components (level, slope, curvature) of 10 series of zero-coupon Treasury bond rates with maturities from 1 to 10 years. We fit this model using monthly data from 1990. Unlike classic models with hidden stochastic volatility, here it is observed as VIX: the volatility index for the S&amp;P 500 stock market index. Surprisingly, this stock index volatility works for Treasury bonds, too. Next, we prove long-term stability and the Law of Large Numbers. We express total returns of zero-coupon bonds using these principal components. We prove the Law of Large Numbers for these returns. All results are done for discrete and continuous time.</description>

      <title>Sparse Asymptotic PCA: Identifying Sparse Latent Factors Across Time Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel sparse latent factor modeling framework using sparse asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA) to analyze the co-movements of high-dimensional panel data over time. Unlike existing methods based on sparse PCA, which assume sparsity in the loading matrices, our approach posits sparsity in the factor processes while allowing non-sparse loadings. This is motivated by the fact that financial returns typically exhibit universal and non-sparse exposure to market factors. Unlike the commonly used $\ell_1$-relaxation in sparse PCA, the proposed sparse APCA employs a truncated power method to estimate the leading sparse factor and a sequential deflation method for multi-factor cases under $\ell_0$-constraints. Furthermore, we develop a data-driven approach to identify the sparsity of risk factors over the time horizon using a novel cross-sectional cross-validation method. We establish the consistency of our estimators under mild conditions as both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $T$ grow. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. Empirically, we apply our method to daily S&amp;P 500 stock returns (2004--2016) and identify nine risk factors influencing the stock market.</description>
