      <title>Isomorphism types of definable (maximal) cofinitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kastermans proved that consistently $\bigoplus_{\aleph_1} \mathbb{Z}_2$ has a cofinitary representation. We present a short proof that $\bigoplus_{\mathfrak{c}} \mathbb{Z}_2$ always has an arithmetic cofinitary representation. Further, for every finite group $F$ we construct an arithmetic maximal cofinitary group of isomorphism type $(\ast_{\mathfrak{c}} \mathbb{Z}) \times F$. This answers an implicit question by Schrittesser and Mejak whether one may construct definable maximal cofinitary groups not decomposing into free products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variant of the Kurepa family. We then use one such family to construct a ccc indestructible property associated with a complete coherent Suslin tree $S$. Moreover, in every ccc forcing extension that preserves Suslin of $S$, forcing with $S$ induces a strong negative partition relation.</description>

      <title>Manifold classification from the descriptive viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider classification problems for manifolds and discrete subgroups of Lie groups from a descriptive set-theoretic point of view. This work is largely foundational in conception and character, recording both a framework for general study and Borel complexity computations for some of the most fundamental classes of manifolds. We show, for example, that for all $n\geq 0$, the homeomorphism problem for compact topological $n$-manifolds is Borel equivalent to the relation $=_{\mathbb{N}}$ of equality on the natural numbers, while the homeomorphism problem for noncompact topological $2$-manifolds is of maximal complexity among equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures. A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan--Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck--Zimmer and Andretta--Camerlo--Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth--Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $=_{\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy. We close with a survey of the most immediate open questions.</description>

      <title>On the word problem for just infinite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we establish that the word problem is algorithmically decidable for finitely generated just infinite groups given by a recursively enumerable set of relations. The proof does not use the Wilson--Grigorchuk theorem on the classification of just infinite groups, and the argument proceeds directly from the definition, using ideas from classical results on decidability of the word problem: Kuznetsov's theorem on simple groups and the Dyson--Mostowski theorem on residually finite groups.</description>

      <title>The Radon--Nikodym topography of acyclic measured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study locally countable acyclic measure-class-preserving (mcp) Borel graphs by analyzing their "topography" -- the interaction between the geometry and the associated Radon--Nikodym cocycle. We identify three notions of topographic significance for ends in such graphs and show that the number of nonvanishing ends governs both amenability and smoothness. More precisely, we extend the Adams dichotomy from the pmp to the mcp setting, replacing the number of ends with the number of nonvanishing ends: an acyclic mcp graph is amenable if and only if a.e. component has at most two nonvanishing ends, while it is nowhere amenable exactly when a.e. component has a nonempty perfect (closed) set of nonvanishing ends. We also characterize smoothness: an acyclic mcp graph is essentially smooth if and only if a.e. component has no nonvanishing ends. Furthermore, we show that the notion of nonvanishing ends depends only on the measure class and not on the specific measure.
  At the heart of our analysis lies the study of acyclic countable-to-one Borel functions. Our critical result is that, outside of the essentially two-ended setting, all back ends in a.e. orbit are vanishing and admit cocycle-finite geodesics. We also show that the number of barytropic ends controls the essential number of ends for such functions. This leads to a surprising topographic characterization of when such functions are essentially one-ended.
  Our proofs utilize mass transport, end selection, and the notion of the Radon--Nikodym core for acyclic mcp graphs, a new concept that serves as a guiding framework for our topographic analysis.</description>

      <title>The Logical Structure of Physical Laws: A Fixed Point Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalise the self referential definition of physical laws using monotone operators on a lattice of theories, resolving the pathologies of naive set theoretic formulations. By invoking Tarski fixed point theorem, we identify physical theories as least fixed points of admissibility constraints derived from Galois connections. We demonstrate that QED and General Relativity can be represented in such a logical structure with respect to their symmetry and locality principles.</description>

      <title>Simple Models of Randomization and Preservation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to present a new and more uniform model-theoretic/combinatorial proof of the theorem ([5]): The randomization $T^{R}$ of a complete first-order theory $T$ with $NIP$ is a (complete) first-order continuous theory with $NIP$. The proof method is based on the significant use of a particular type of models of $T^{R}$, namely simple models, certain indiscernible arrays, and Rademacher mean width. Using simple models of $T^R$ gives the advantage of re-proving this theorem in a simpler and quantitative manner. We finally turn our attention to $NSOP$ in randomization. We show that based on the definition of $NSOP$ given [13], $T^R$ is stable if and only if it is $NIP$ and $NSOP$.</description>

Abstract: We present a formalization of Borel determinacy in the Lean 4 theorem prover. The formalization includes a definition of Gale-Stewart games and a proof of Martin's theorem stating that Borel games are determined.

      <description>arXiv:2506.20874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate pre-local tabularity in normal extensions of the logic $\mathrm{S4}\times \mathrm{S4}$. We show that there are exactly four pre-locally tabular logics in normal extensions of products of finite height, and that every non-locally tabular logic in this family is contained in one of them. We also give an axiomatic criterion of local tabularity above the logic of products with Noetherian skeletons. Finally, we discuss examples of pre-locally tabular extensions of $\mathrm{S4}\times \mathrm{S4}$ outside this class, including logics with the converse and universal modalities.</description>

      <title>The fractal Goodstein principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14768v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original Goodstein process is based on writing numbers in hereditary $b$-exponential normal form: that is, each number $n$ is written in some base $b\geq 2$ as $n=b^ea+r$, with $e$ and $r$ iteratively being written in hereditary $b$-exponential normal form. We define a new process which generalises the original by writing expressions in terms of a hierarchy of bases $B$, instead of a single base $b$. In particular, the `digit' $a$ may itself be written with respect to a smaller base $b'$. We show that this new process always terminates, but termination is independent of Kripke-Platek set theory, or other theories of Bachmann-Howard strength.</description>

      <title>Cubic Incompleteness: Hilbert's Tenth Problem at Degree Three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00759v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the cubic fragment $\mathcal D_3$ over $\mathbb N$ by isolating the uniform closure principle any total correct cubic solver would have to realize. In $\mathsf{HA}$ we give a fully constructive, additive and degree-controlled encoding of bounded verification: for each externally fixed bound, we effectively produce a finite system of degree-3 Diophantine equations whose solutions represent the existence of the corresponding finite proof or computation trace. The encoding is purely syntactic, using "gadgets" and "Carryless Pairing". In a classical metatheory (e.g. $\mathsf{PA}$) we show that the global solver hypothesis implies a uniform operator eliminating the bound inside $\mathcal D_3$, which is incompatible with standard non-uniformity/realizability constraints. Hence no uniform cubic can exist clasically.</description>

      <title>Algebraic independence of the solutions of the classical Lotka-Volterra system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$ be distinct non-constant and non-degenerate solutions of the classical Lotka-Volterra system \begin{equation}\notag \begin{split} x'&amp;= axy + bx\\ y'&amp;= cxy + dy, \end{split} \end{equation} where $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$. We show that if $d$ and $b$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$, then the solutions are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{C}$, that is $tr.deg_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}(x_1,y_1,\ldots,x_n,y_n)=2n$. As a main part of the proof, we show that the set defined by the system in universal differential fields, with $d$ and $b$ linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$, is strongly minimal and geometrically trivial. Our techniques also allows us to obtain partial results for some of the more general $2d$-Lotka-Volterra system.</description>

      <title>Decomposing graphs into stable and ordered parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connections between structural graph theory and finite model theory recently gained a lot of attention. In this setting, many interesting questions remain on the properties of dependent (NIP) hereditary classes of graphs, in particular related to first-order transductions. In this paper, we study modelizations (which are strong forms of transduction pairings) of classes of graphs by classes of structures. In particular, we consider models obtained by coupling a partial order and a colored graph (thus forming a partially ordered colored graph). Motivated by Simon's decomposition theorem of dependent types into a stable part and a distal (order-like) part, we conjecture that every dependent hereditary class of graphs admits a modelization in a monadically dependent coupling of a class of posets with bounded treewidth cover graphs and a monadically stable class of colored graphs. In this paper, we consider the first non-trivial case (classes with bounded linear cliquewidth) and prove that the conjecture holds in a strong form, the model class being a monadically dependent coupling of a class of disjoint unions of chains and a class of colored graphs with bounded pathwidth. We extend our study to classes that admit bounded-size bounded linear cliquewidth decompositions and prove that they have a modelization in a monadically dependent coupling of a class of disjoint unions of chains and a class of colored graphs with bounded expansion, the model class also admitting bounded-size bounded linear cliquewidth decompositions.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial behavior via constructibility in multigraded algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Piecewise quasipolynomial growth of Presburger counting functions combines with tame persistent homology module theory to conclude piecewise quasipolynomial behavior of constructible families of finely graded modules over constructible commutative semigroup rings. Functorial preservation of constructibility for families under local cohomology, $\operatorname{Tor}$, and $\operatorname{Ext}$ yield piecewise quasipolynomial, quasilinear, or quasiconstant growth statements for length of local cohomology, $a$-invariants, regularity, depth; length of $\operatorname{Tor}$ and Betti numbers; length of $\operatorname{Ext}$ and Bass numbers; associated primes via $v$-invariants; and extended degrees, including the usual degree, Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity, arithmetic degree, and homological degree.</description>
