      <title>Kolmogorov Scaling for Total Energy and Cross Helicity in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of scaling in isotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence has remained unresolved, with competing predictions of $k^{-5/3}$ (Kolmogorov) and $k^{-3/2}$ (Iroshnikov-Kraichnan) scalings. In this paper, we address this long-standing controversy using high-resolution numerical simulations on $8192^2$ and $1536^3$ grids. We show that the total energy and cross helicity spectra are closer to $k^{-5/3}$ than $k^{-3/2}$. The fluxes and structure functions of the total energy and cross helicity also demonstrate robust support for Kolmogorov scaling. The magnetic energy shows $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum, but the kinetic energy exhibits $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum; the latter spectrum is due to the energy transfers from the magnetic field to the velocity field.</description>

      <title>Passive freeze-out of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) poses a major challenge in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) due to its role in mixing and performance degradation. We report the first experimental observation of passive freeze-out of RMI in a low-pressure surrogate regime; an instability stagnation effect induced without modifying the driving pressure pulse or the target surface geometry. Using additively manufactured sub-surface voids in a sinusoidal target, we convert a single shock into a sequence of weaker shocks that suppress instability growth upstream of the surface by over 70%. High-speed X-ray imaging and hydrodynamic simulations suggest that this suppression arises primarily from temporal shaping, with lesser contributions from spatial curvature and shock weakening. Our results demonstrate a driver-independent pathway for controlling shock-driven hydrodynamic instabilities relevant to ICF and other high energy density systems.</description>

      <title>Unstable magnetic reconnection self-generates turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are deeply intertwined in magnetohydrodynamic flows, yet how reconnection self-generates turbulence remains unclear. Using an ensemble of high-resolution three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of an unstable magnetised jet with an initially weak mean field, we demonstrate a self-sustained transition from laminar reconnection to fully developed turbulence in the absence of external forcing. We show that a three-dimensional current-sheet instability triggers stochastic reconnection, leading to persistent turbulent energy injection. Energy-budget analysis reveals that the coupling between the turbulent electromotive force and the magnetic mean shear dominates turbulent production, with magnetic fluctuations subsequently transferring energy to the kinetic field through a nonlinear cascade.</description>

      <title>Collisional-radiative data for tokamak disruption mitigation modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective tokamak disruption mitigation is crucial for ensuring the safety and integrity of fusion power reactors. Accurate collisional-radiative (CR) modeling of a radiative plasma is a critical component in predictive disruption mitigation design. In this paper, we focus on quasi-steady-state CR modeling applicable to the current quench phase of a tokamak disruption. We employ the ATOMIC collisional-radiative code from the Los Alamos suite and the newly developed Fusion Collisional-Radiative (FCR) code to model the atomic processes, providing high-fidelity data for radiative power loss, as well as average and effective charge states for hydrogen, helium, neon, and argon plasma species over a wide range of tokamak-relevant electron temperatures and electron densities. Fine-structure-resolved CR models are used for hydrogen and helium plasma species, while configuration-average CR models are implemented for neon and argon plasma species. The calculated values are compared with the superconfiguration CR model (FLYCHK) and the commonly used coronal equilibrium approximation to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of each model. To facilitate coupling of high-fidelity CR data to plasma simulation models, we represent the ATOMIC/FCR results over the relevant plasma parameter range using a smooth tensor product B-spline surface in electron temperature and electron density. This approach yields compact coefficient tables that can be evaluated efficiently while preserving spline smoothness across the domain. These data were previously used to examine ways to minimize runaway electrons in a tokamak current quench, and they are now made available in easy-to-use forms for community use and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-ordered correlators for turbulent fields: a quantum-classical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extended formulation of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), which quantify noncommutative operator growth and information scrambling in quantum many-body systems, is developed for turbulence dynamics as a representative of non-canonical Hamiltonian systems. Based on the Wigner-Weyl transform and the Moyal bracket formalism, the semiclassical limit of OTOC for turbulent plasmas governed by the Hasegawa-Mima equation is derived as an ensemble-averaged squared Lie-Poisson bracket between two chosen functionals of the turbulent fields. The classical-limit OTOC provides a quantitative measure of how a variational perturbation applied to one functional propagates across scales in the turbulent dynamics and how it affects another functional at a later time, thereby capturing scale-dependent or field-dependent transfer processes. In a quasilinear approximation with a strong zonal flow, we derive an inverse-square decay of the OTOC with the time lag, indicating an algebraic suppression of the zonal-mode response to perturbations of the non-zonal fields. This behavior is attributed to zonal-flow shearing, which rapidly scrambles the non-zonal perturbation toward higher wavenumbers, and consequently reduces the low-wavenumber non-zonal content that can feed back onto large-scale zonal modes.</description>

      <title>Effects of Screening and Pressure Ionization on the Electron Broadening of Spectral Lines in Dense Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions between electrons and radiating atoms broaden spectral absorption and emission lines in dense plasmas. High densities also introduce screening and pressure ionization effects that distort the wavefunctions of both bound and free electrons. In order to study how dense plasma effects influence the electron broadening of spectral lines, this paper incorporates electron wavefunctions from an average-atom (AA) model to calculate the line width of the B III $2p-2s$ transition at $T = 10$ eV for mass densities ranging from $\rho=10^{-4}-0.4$ g/cc. The calculation method uses the impact approximation, allowing the line width to be written in terms of electron-collision cross sections and an interference term. Compared to an otherwise identical calculation that uses Coulomb free wavefunctions, the AA method is found to modify both the cross sections and the resulting line width at sufficiently high density by introducing screening and pressure ionized bound states. Screening lowers the cross sections at low energies and near electron excitation thresholds, while pressure ionized bound states introduce resonances into the continuum. Thus, as the density increases, the relative line width between the AA and Coulomb calculations follows a general decrease because of screening, with sharp increases at various intervals due to pressure ionization. The AA results are also compared with a common approach to introduce screening through the interaction potential and reduced models that use the Bethe formula for the inelastic electron-collision cross sections.</description>

      <title>Effects of realistic laser intensity and phase distribution on high-charge laser wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) can produce relativistic electron beams and various secondary particles in centimeter-long plasmas, making it a valuable particle source with important applications in many disciplines. In this work, we examine the effects of non-ideal transverse intensity and phase distribution of laser pulses on LWFA through both experimental measurements and particle-in-cell simulations. The complex transverse profile of the 75 TW laser pulses reduces the self-focused intensity in plasma compared with a transversely Gaussian laser. Furthermore, the sheath structure of the nonlinear plasma wake excited by realistic laser pulses is wider and more complicated than that of a Gaussian laser. These hinder the injection of the plasma electrons. As the laser pulse propagates through the plasma, its intensity profile gradually becomes elliptical and drives a plasma wake with a sharp sheath near the azimuths of the major axis, leading to an injection. When using a realistic laser profile in simulations, both the charge and energy of injected electrons closely match experimental results ($\sim200$ pC of charge and $\sim 200$ MeV peak energy), whereas the Gaussian laser simulations produce much higher charge ($\sim500$ pC). Our findings reveal the difference in injection dynamics between LWFA driven by non-ideal laser pulses and those driven by Gaussian pulses, and are useful for applications of LWFA which demand high-charge electron beams.</description>

      <title>Runaway electron generation in ITER mitigated disruptions with improved physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess runaway-electron (RE) generation in ITER disruptions mitigated by shattered pellet injection (SPI) using improved physics modelling in the 1D disruption simulation framework Dream. To this end, we extend Dream with four ITER-relevant physics models: (i) a reduced model for RE scrape- off associated with the vertical plasma motion, (ii) a semi-analytical plasmoid- drift model for material deposition, (iii) an adaptive hyper-resistive transport model to suppress unphysical thin-current channels during the current quench (CQ), and (iv) an updated Compton RE generation seed calculated for the new ITER tungsten first-wall design. We simulate full-current 15 MA L-mode (H26, non-nuclear) and H-mode (DTHmode24, nuclear) scenarios, and an intermediate- current 7.5 MA H-mode non-nuclear case, from realistic ITER inputs. Complete avoidance of a multi-MA RE beam is found to require a long pre-thermal quench (TQ) duration to thermalize the hot-tail electrons, high deuterium assimilation with limited neon, and a representative seed current comparable to a single RE in ITER. As previously found with lower fidelity setups [Vallhagen et al, Nucl. Fusion 64 (2024)], these conditions are met by staggered or low-Ne injections in H26, but are typically violated in DT H-mode when nuclear seeds are present. In addition to analyzing the effect of the new models, we investigate the role of the current spike associated with the TQ and importance of radial transport of runaways in the CQ. After incorporating these additional physical effects into a comprehensive disruption model and analyzing their impact, we present a representative ITER DT H-mode SPI scenario which provides a theoretically viable route to tolerable RE currents in ITER fusion power operation.</description>

      <title>Global Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Monster Shocks in Neutron Star Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waves launched from the neutron star surface or inner magnetosphere propagate through the magnetosphere as small perturbations, but can grow relative to the background magnetic field and steepen into ``monster shocks'' -- ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks which can power high-energy emission from magnetars, neutron star mergers and collapse. They occur in magnetically dominated plasma and are described by relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We present global relativistic MHD simulations of monster shocks in unperturbed and perturbed (``wrinkled'') backgrounds with a global dipolar geometry. Our simulations confirm analytical predictions for equatorial shocks and provide new insight into the behavior of oblique shocks off the equator. Simulations where the shock is formed through Alfv\'{e}n mode to fast mode conversion are also presented, demonstrating the generic nature of the monster shock mechanism. We explore how the presence of additional modes in the magnetosphere modifies the shock behavior. Modes of comparable amplitude can fragment the shock front, substantially reduce the magnetization, produce localized enhancements in the Lorentz factor relative to an unperturbed dipole background, and intermittently generate additional shocks along a line of sight.</description>

      <title>Whistler-Alfv\'en turbulence in a non-neutral ultrarelativistic pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale dynamics of most conventional space and astrophysical plasmas are predominantly governed by Alfv\'en modes, which are low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic modes existing in magnetized media. At scales smaller than the ion gyroscale or frequencies exceeding the ion cyclotron frequency, the Alfv\'en modes transform into kinetic-Alfv\'en or whistler modes that significantly contribute to plasma dynamics. However, this scenario reverses in non-neutral pair plasmas, such as those found in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars, around rotating black holes and in their relativistic jets, as well as in certain laboratory plasmas. In these systems, the large-scale dynamics is governed by hybrid whistler-Alfv\'en modes, which transform into pure Alfv\'en modes at smaller scales. We derive the nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of whistler-Alfv\'en modes in ultrarelativistic non-neutral magnetically dominated pair plasma and discuss the spectrum of turbulence governed by these equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article Nuclear Fusion \textbf{66}, 016012 (2026) by Richard Fitzpatrick is based on fundamental errors in the physics of the poloidal magnetic flux in tokamaks. His paper was inspired by an article that I posted on arXiv in various versions, $\big&lt;$arxiv.org/abs/2507.05456$\big&gt;$. The September 9, 2025 version was submitted to the Physics of Plasmas, which flatly rejected the article. Before I can resubmit, the Physics of Plasmas stated that the issues with the Fitzpatrick article must be explained. Not only did Fitzpatrick make numerous fundamental errors in science, he totally misrepresented my views as clearly stated in my article and even more explicitly in email exchanges, called ``private communication" in his paper.</description>

      <title>A coherent structure transport model for scrape-off layer turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the locality of high-temperature plasma energy deposition on material surfaces in fusion reactors is critical for design. Here, we utilize the Gyrokinetic ElectroMagnetic turbulence including X-points (GEMX) simulation, together with SOLPS-ITER solutions for the background equilibrium electric field including drifts, to model the heat flux at the divertor plate and characterize the heat load width using realistic X-point geometry. We use a theory-based blobby transport model called the "Coherent Structure Transport" (CST) model to include the effect of plasma transport in the edge scrape-off layer. The CST model is extremely fast and can be used to quickly analyze any SOLPS-ITER solution. SOLPS-ITER provides the steady state, or equilibrium on which we superimpose blobby turbulence characterized by blob size, amplitude and frequency. We obtain the $1/B_p$ scaling of the heat load exponential decay width $\lambda_q$, in agreement with the Eich empirical scaling and with the Goldston heuristic theory. When including blobby turbulence in combination with the SOLPS-ITER electric field, we find a secondary peak in the heat flux radial profile, outwardly displaced from the strike point radius, with a relative amplitude that increases with the initial blob density. We describe the CST model in detail and provide initial investigations of the scaling of $\lambda_q$ and the secondary heat flux peak with blob size and amplitude.</description>
