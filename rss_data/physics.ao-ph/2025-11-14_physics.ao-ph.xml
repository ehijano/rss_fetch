      <title>The Role of Deep Mesoscale Eddies in Ensemble Forecast Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present forecasting efforts rely on assimilation of observational data captured in the upper ocean (&lt; 1000 m depth). These observations constrain the upper ocean and minimally influence the deep ocean. Nevertheless, development of the full water column circulation critically depends upon the dynamical interactions between upper and deep fields. Forecasts demonstrate that the initialization of the deep field is influential for the development and evolution of the surface in the forecast. Deep initial conditions that better agree with observations have lower upper ocean uncertainty as the forecast progresses. Here, best and worst ensemble members in two 92-day forecasts are identified and contrasted in order to determine how the deep ocean differs between these groups. The forecasts cover the duration of the Loop Current Eddy Thor separation event, which coincides with available deep observations in the Gulf. Model member performance is assessed by comparing surface variables against verifying analysis and satellite altimeter data during the forecast time-period. Deep cyclonic and anticyclonic features are reviewed, and compared against deep observations, indicating subtle differences in locations of deep eddies at relevant times. These results highlight both the importance of deep circulation in the dynamics of the Loop Current system and more broadly motivate efforts to assimilate deep observations to better constrain the deep initial fields and improve surface predictions.</description>

      <title>Oya: Deep Learning for Accurate Global Precipitation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.</description>

      <title>High-level, high-resolution ocean modeling at all scales with Oceananigans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the user interface, governing equations, and numerical methods underpinning the community ocean modeling software called "Oceananigans". Oceananigans development has been lead by the Climate Modeling Alliance to build a trainable climate model with quantifiable uncertainty. Oceananigans is written in the Julia programming language, which, like similar recent efforts based on modern programming languages, distinguishes it from usual software based on Fortran. Oceananigans can efficiently simulate all scales of ocean motion, ranging from millimeter-scale turbulence in a small box to planetary-scale ocean circulation. Oceananigans design combines (i) a basic structured finite volume algorithm (ii) optimized for high-resolution simulations on GPUs which is (iii) exposed behind a high-level, programmable user interface. This design negotiates a dual mandate for highest-possible performance (to support state-of-the-art applications) and enhanced accessibility (to facilitate adoption and development). The dual mandate aims ultimately to accelerate the progress of Earth system science. Achieving this aim, however, requires a substantial and sustained increase in the collective effort of Oceananigans development.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous soil moisture fields suppress Sahelian MCS frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding controls on Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) is critical for predicting rainfall extremes across scales. Spatial variability of soil moisture (SM) presents such a control, with ~200km dry patches in the Sahel observed to intensify mature MCSs. Here we test MCS sensitivity to spatial scales of surface heterogeneity using a framework of 78 Unified Model experiments initialised from scale-filtered SM. We demonstrate the control of SM heterogeneity on MCS populations, and the mechanistic chain via which spatial variability propagates through surface fluxes to convective boundary layer development and storm environments. When all sub-synoptic SM variability is homogenised, peak MCS counts drop by 23%, whereas maintaining small-scale variability maintains primary initiation rates, reducing the drop in MCS totals. In sensitivity experiments, boundary layer development prior to MCSs is similar to that over mesoscale dry SM anomalies, but driven by cloud-free slots of increased shortwave radiation. This reduces storm numbers and potential predictability.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is a local well-posedness result in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. The time of existence that we obtain is uniform with respect to the size $\epsilon$ of the perturbation, and boils down to the large time $1/\epsilon$ with the assumptions of the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020. With additional assumptions, it is also uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>
