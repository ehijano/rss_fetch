      <title>It costs nothing to teleport information into a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often claimed that adding a qubit to a black hole requires energy $\Delta E \geq T_H \log 2$ so that the extra Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can accommodate the qubit. In this essay, we explain how the recently discovered phenomenon of black hole decoherence allows quantum information to be teleported into a black hole, with arbitrarily small energy cost. The generalized second law is not violated and there is no conflict with unitarity because the teleportation creates new entanglement, analogous to Hawking radiation, between the black hole interior and exterior. In accordance with Landauer's principle, a nonzero minimum energy cost only appears when there is a net erasure of information and noise from the exterior or, equivalently, when ``zerobits'' are sent into the black hole.</description>

      <title>Emergent Strings in Type IIB Calabi--Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau threefolds, in light of the Emergent String Conjecture. We focus on the so-called type II limits, which, based on the asymptotic behaviour of the physical couplings in the low-energy effective theory, are candidates for emergent string limits. However, due to the absence of Type IIB branes of suitable dimensionality, the emergence of a unique critical string accompanied by a tower of Kaluza--Klein states has so far remained elusive. By considering a broad class of type II$_b$ limits, corresponding to so-called Tyurin degenerations, and studying the asymptotic behaviour of four-dimensional EFT strings in this geometry, we argue that the worldsheet theory of the latter describes a unique critical heterotic string on $T^2\times\mathrm{K3}$ with a gauge bundle whose rank depends on $b$. In addition, we establish the presence of an infinite tower of BPS particles arising from wrapped D3-branes by identifying a suitable set of special Lagrangian 3-cycles in the geometry. The associated BPS invariants are conjectured to be counted by generalisations of modular forms. As a consistency check, we further show that in special cases mirror symmetry identifies the EFT strings with the well-understood emergent string limits in the K\"ahler moduli space of Type IIA compactifications on K3-fibred Calabi--Yau threefolds. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Emergent String Conjecture for type II limits which do not correspond to Tyurin degenerations, and predict new constraints on the possible geometries of type II degenerations which resemble those arising in the Kulikov classification of degenerations of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Charting the Triality Webs for All Smooth Fano 3-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine all toric phases for the $2d$ $(0,2)$ theories on D1-branes probing the complex cones over the 18 smooth Fano 3-folds, whose toric diagrams correspond to the regular reflexive polytopes in 3 dimensions. These results significantly expand the list of explicitly known gauge theories on D1-branes over toric CY 4-folds. We go beyond the classification of toric phases and map the corresponding triality webs, establishing how the toric phases are connected by triality. The size and complexity of the webs constructed in this work far surpass any previously known examples, both in the contexts of Calabi-Yau 3-folds and 4-folds-with several of these CY 4-folds exhibiting hundreds of toric phases. We propose various new approaches for characterizing triality webs. Our work lays the foundation for a comprehensive exploration of the structure of triality webs.</description>

      <title>Reminiscences about Steven Weinberg (This Time it's Personal)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steven Weinberg productive scientific life teaches us many things, one of the most important of which is the power of his example. This essay contains personal reminiscences and a speculation about gravitational wave propagation based on one of his very last papers -- as seems fitting, given his penchant for putting interesting physics into the essays he wrote for other luminaries over the years. (See arXiv:2502.10979 [physics.hist-ph] for a less personal summary of his main scientific accomplishments.)</description>

      <title>A Renormalization Group Analysis of the Ising Model Coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix model characterizing the Ising model coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) from the point of view of the Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE). This model is a dually weighted matrix model, whose Feynman diagrams are in correspondence with discrete triangulations of two-dimensional geometries with a preferred time foliation. In particular, we find the fixed points of the beta-function equations, showing that the number of relevant directions in each case is compatible with the physical interpretation of the CFT at the fixed point. In addition to recovering the fixed points for topological gravity and pure gravity with a cosmological constant, we find a new fixed point featuring three relevant directions which matches the number of primary fields in the Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>Power Spectra in Double-Field Inflation Using Renormalization-Group Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perturbative strategy for inflation described by two-inflaton fields is developed using a mathematical analogy with the renormalization-group. Two small quantities, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, corresponding to standard slow-roll parameters are defined and systematic expansions of all inflationary quantities in terms of powers of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are found. No other slow-roll parameters are needed. To illustrate this perturbative method in the multi-field context, we adopt a simple two-inflaton model with quadratic potentials in the parameter range where both fields contribute similarly to the dynamics of inflation. The model, even though it is not a viable alternative for phenomenological description of the inflationary period, nicely illustrates subtleties of the perturbative approach. In particular, this method allows us to derive two independent gauge-invariant scalar perturbations that are conserved in the superhorizon limit, overcoming typical problems that emerge in multi-field inflation. Furthermore, it is possible to perform nonperturbative resummations that allow to study the model in a true multi-field regime. We derive tensor and scalar power spectra to the next-to-next-to-leading and next-to-leading orders, respectively, as well as their spectral indices. The hierarchy between the two scalar perturbations allows us to single out the dominant entry of the scalar power-spectrum matrix. Modifications due to the second inflaton occur already at the leading order. Finally, we explain why the quadratic two-inflaton model is not compatible with the present experimental constraints even though non-trivial corrections to scalar perturbations do emerge.</description>

      <title>New intertwining operators for the Calogero model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is long known that quantum Calogero models feature intertwining operators, which increase or decrease the coupling constant by an integer amount, for any fixed number of particles. We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging new structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formul\ae\ for the new intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one.</description>

      <title>Feshbach-Villars Formalism for a Spin-1/2 Particle in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the Feshbach-Villars (FV) formalism for spin-1/2 particles in curved spacetime. We derive the Hamiltonian form of the Dirac equation in this context and extend the FV transformation accordingly. The generalized Klein-Gordon equation, obtained by squaring the Dirac operator, is reformulated using the FV approach. We present the resulting Hamiltonian in both matrix and Pauli matrix forms, considering gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. The formalism is examined in both (1+2) and (1+3) dimensional spacetimes, with special attention given to the spin-field interaction term. This study provides a framework for studying relativistic quantum mechanics in curved spacetime, offering insights into the interplay between quantum effects, gravity, and electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Bounds on dilaton and complex structure moduli values for perturbative control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String compactification in the framework of the low energy effective supergravity requires the perturbative control in both the large volume and the weak coupling expansions. However, if the K\"ahler potential respects the SL$(2, \mathbb{Z})$ (Sp$(2(h^{2,1}+1))$) symmetry of the axio-dilaton (complex structure moduli) even at the quantum level, the corrected K\"ahler potential generated by the coupling of the dilaton (complex structure moduli) to some lattice structure may diverge in the large field limit, resulting in the lost of the perturbative control. As can be found in the explicitly calculable models, such a divergence may not be affected by the symmetry breaking by, for example, the gauge fields in the brane. This sets the upper bounds on the field values of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli determined by the volume of the internal manifold and the string coupling constant, hence the Kaluza-Klein and the string mass scales. The form and the interpretation of these bounds are quite similar to those of the distance conjecture, preventing the descent of a tower of states by the upper bounds on the moduli values.</description>

      <title>Graviton Scattering on Gravitational Atoms: Relic Graviton Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering of a graviton on a gravitational atom. By gravitational atom we mean a quantum mechanical system of a gravitational (bound) state of two massive particles, with possibly some boundary conditions (such as bouncing on a table or hanging as a pendulum). We demonstrate the unexpected fact, that the total absorption cross section is universal, it is independent of both the mass of the gravitationally bound particle or of the mass providing the binding potential. We find that the total absorption cross-section is simply proportional to the Planck area, multiplied by a dimensionless, numerical factor. We speculate about the potential for detection of relic gravitons shot noise.</description>

      <title>Metrics over multi-parameter AdS vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the notion of a distance between different AdS vacua of string theory. The distance is measured by a metric that is derived by taking an off-shell quadratic variation of the effective action, and evaluating it over families of vacua. We calculate this metric for increasingly complex families of vacua. We first consider the two-parameter families of solutions of type $\mathrm{AdS}_4 \times \mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^3$. We find that the metric is flat and positive, and so yields a well-defined distance along any path in the space of solutions. We then consider solutions of type $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times S^3 \times \mathrm{CY}_2$ which have two (non-compact) flux parameters as well as a moduli space. We find that the space of solutions factorises between directions which vary the AdS radius, and the moduli space. The metric over AdS variations is flat and positive, and the metric over the moduli space is the usual one. Finally, we consider solutions of type $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ which also have a further direction in the space of solutions that is compact. We find that the metric is flat only on non-compact directions in the space of solutions. Restricting to such directions, we evaluate the metric and find it is positive definite and therefore yields a well-defined distance along any path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the trace anomaly, which results from the integration of the massless conformal fermion field with the background of metric and antisymmetric tensor fields. The non-local terms in the anomaly-induced effective action do not depend on the scheme of quantum calculations. On the other hand, total derivative terms in the anomaly and the corresponding local part of the induced action manifest scheme dependence and multiplicative anomaly.</description>

      <title>Interacting $p$-form gauge theories: New developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge $p$-forms in diverse dimensions are ubiquitous in supergravity and string theory. This work reviews novel covariant formulations designed to generate arbitrary interacting duality-invariant or chiral (self-dual) $p$-form theories in $d = 2p + 2$ space-time dimensions. For odd $p$, such theories possess $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality invariance and include the Born-Infeld and ModMax theories. For even $p$, they describe a self-interacting chiral $p$-form with its gauge-invariant field strength obeying a nonlinear self-duality condition. We provide a complete description of $T\bar T$-like deformations of $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics in four dimensions and their six-dimensional counterparts -- interacting chiral two-form field theories. We also elaborate on consistent flows in the spaces of duality-invariant or chiral (self-dual) $p$-form theories beyond six dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic nonlinear theories of chiral 2-form electrodynamics allow superluminal propagation in some stationary homogeneous backgrounds and are therefore acausal. We find a simple parameterisation of the subclass of causal theories. By construction of the stress-energy tensor from the Hamiltonian density, we show that causality implies both the Dominant and Strong energy conditions. We also revisit the Perry-Schwarz formulation, clarifying aspects of it and of its relation to the Hamiltonian formulation.</description>

      <title>Global variants of $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theories and Calogero-Moser systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global variants of four-dimensional gauge theories are specified by their spectrum of genuine Wilson-'t Hooft line operators. The choice of global variant has significant consequences when spacetime is taken to be $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$. We focus on $\mathcal N=1^*$ theories, which are closely connected to twisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems. We establish, on general grounds, how this gauge-theoretic topological data manifests itself on the integrable system side by introducing a notion of global variants for complex many-body integrable systems associated with Lie algebras. Focusing on $\mathcal N=1^*$ theories of type $A$ and $B_2$, we elucidate the implications for the structure of gapped vacua, the emergent (generalized) symmetries realized in each vacuum, and the action of spontaneously broken modular invariance.</description>

We base our claim on genuine multi-entropy, a new measure for multi-partite entanglement. We also discuss a connection between the bulk IR reconstruction and many-partite entanglement on a large number of boundary subregions.</description>

      <title>De Sitter entropy: on-shell versus off-shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attributing thermodynamic properties to the Bunch-Davies state in static patch of de Sitter space and setting the corresponding equations of state, we demonstrate that, for pure gravity, the bulk entropy computed on-shell as a volume integral in de Sitter space coincides with the Wald entropy (area law) in any spacetime dimension and for any theory of f(R) gravity. We extend this result to the renormalized entanglement entropy of a non-minimally coupled scalar field. From the on-shell perspective, entropy emerges as a bulk contribution, whereas from the off-shell viewpoint, it manifests as a boundary (horizon) contribution. As a result, in de Sitter space, generalized entropy can be understood in two distinct ways: either as a bulk or as a boundary contribution.</description>

      <title>General relativistic effects on photon spectrum emitted from dark matter halos around primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate general relativistic effects on the photon spectrum emitted from decaying (or annihilating) particle dark matter in the halo surrounding a primordial black hole. The spectrum undergoes significant modification due to gravitational redshifts, which induces broadening as a result of the intense gravitational field near the black hole. This characteristic alteration in the photon spectrum presents a unique observational signature. Future observations of such spectral features may provide critical evidence for a mixed dark matter scenario, involving both primordial black holes and particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Higher-Order Classical Symplectic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non -strictly conformal transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping LSS perturbation theory beyond third order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bootstrap techniques relying on the constraints imposed by Extended Galilean Invariance (EGI), have proved to be very useful in the context of perturbation theory of the Large Scale Structure (LSS). It has been formulated in both the Eulerian as well as Lagrangian space. While the Eulerian bootstrap formalism has been successfully applied to both tracer and matter kernels, the application of bootstrap methods in Lagrangian space has so far been restricted to matter. Up to third order, it has been shown that implementing EGI constraints in Eulerian space fully reproduces the bias expansion for tracers. Previous studies have demonstrated that time non-locality affects the bias expansion in a non-trivial way starting from fifth order. Motivated by this fact, we extend the bootstrap approach upto fifth order in both Eulerian and Lagrangian space and demonstrate that it fully captures the time non-local effects. For this, we generalize the Lagrangian bootstrap for tracers, and found that it agrees with the corresponding results obtained in Eulerian space. One of the major challenges in implementing EGI constraints in Eulerian space, is to systematically find out all the "spurious poles" and make them vanish. We have proposed a method that bypasses this difficulty making the procedure tractable at higher orders. From Lagrangian perspective, we have identified coefficients in the tracer kernel whose ratios are independent of tracer properties and may serve as direct probes of the underlying cosmology.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by nontrivial vortex-line excitations with topological properties. We develop an associated topological field theory in a curved spatial geometry and study the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the CVLL ground state's chemical potential for interacting bosons in cylindrical moat-band geometries and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>On the bouncing completion of eternal inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a purely kinematical argument, the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem states that any maximal space-time with average positive expansion is geodesically incomplete, hence past eternal inflation would be necessarily singular. Recently, discussions about the broadness of this theorem have been resurfaced by applying it to new models and/or challenging the space-time maximality hypothesis. In the present work, we use reference frames of non co-moving observers and their kinematical properties in order to inquire into the nature of such possible singular beginnings. Using the spatially flat de Sitter (dS) space-time as a laboratory, this approach allows us to exhaust all possibilities bounded by the BGV theorem in the case of general spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometries. We show that either there exists a scalar or parallelly propagated curvature singularity, or the space-time must be past asymptotically dS (with a definite non-zero limit of the Hubble parameter when the scale factor becomes null, hence excluding certain cyclic models) in order to be extensible. We are able to present this local extension without violating the null energy condition, and we show that this extension must contain a bounce. This is a mathematical result based on purely kinematical arguments and intuition. The possible physical realization of such extensions are also discussed. As a side product, we present a new chart that covers all de Sitter space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions within a phenomenological approach to quantum gravity based on spacetime thermodynamics developed by Alonso-Serrano and Li\v{s}ka. The field equations are traceless, similarly to unimodular gravity, and include quadratic curvature corrections. We find that static, spherically symmetric, vacuum spacetimes in this theory split into two branches. The first branch is indistinguishable from corresponding solutions in unimodular gravity and describes Schwarzschild-(Anti) de Sitter black holes. The second branch instead describes horizonless solutions and is characterized by large values of the spatial curvature. We analyze the dynamics of first-order metric perturbations on both branches, showing that there are no deviations from unimodular gravity at this level.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Modular Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the Standard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a modulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an underlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system-termed \emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial dynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze Higgs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its attractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular, we find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs field.</description>

Abstract: Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the copositive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feynman graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while reaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013116 (2021).</description>

Abstract: The Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor cosmological models are studied in both Einstein and Jordan frames, using hydrodynamical and self-interacting scalar field representations of the energy-momentum tensor, leading to the same background solutions. The main features of the corresponding cosmological scenarios are determined. In many cases, we identify a transition from decelerated to accelerated regimes. The properties of the self-interacting scalar field, including the corresponding potential, are determined. Finally, some possible realistic configurations are analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courand-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

Abstract: Isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is introduced to V-QCD, a bottom-up holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model. Using a small isospin chemical potential we extract the symmetry energy in the model, finding excellent agreement with experimental results for some of the potentials. Extending the calculation for finite and arbitrary sized isospin chemical potentials, we construct beta-equilibrated neutron stars via the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations. We find, pleasingly, that the neutron stars passing the mass/radius and tidal deformability constraints are those with the potentials that also lead to excellent symmetry energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently reported new results on the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition form factors using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within a coupled formalism based on the Dyson-Schwinger, Bethe-Salpeter, and Faddeev equations. In this work, we extend our investigation to the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition. Our computed transition form factors show reasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities. However, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a sharper variation than theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is expected, as these continuum QCD analyses account only for the quark-core of baryons, while low photon virtualities are dominated by meson cloud effects. We anticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI framework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and QCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and the contributions of scalar and vector diquarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a robust framework for modeling interacting many-body systems, including the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used ansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U \propto n^{\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local energy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities to $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction.</description>

      <title>Is Lorentz invariance violation found?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01830v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$, which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A Dilaton Sum Rule for the Conformal Anomaly Form Factor in QCD at Order $\alpha_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an off-shell dispersive analysis of the graviton-gluon-gluon \( TJJ \) vertex, extending previous QED and QCD results of this interaction, and show that it satisfies a conformal anomaly sum rule at one-loop, under the most general kinematical conditions. The conformal anomaly form factor emerges from the trace sector of the interaction and its absorptive amplitude is constrained by an area law similarly to the chiral and gravitational anomaly cases. Building on our previous analysis of those anomalies, we illustrate the patterns of cancelation between the localized and the continuum contributions to the spectral density of this form factor. As in the chiral/gravitational case, a spectral flow localizes the exchanged intermediate state at zero momentum transfer as the quark mass is sent to zero. The perturbative analysis indicates that sum rules are central dynamical features of anomaly interactions, and the coupling or the decoupling of the associated dilaton poles are correlated with the saturation of the sum rule either by a pole or by a dispersive cut. In the conformal and on-shell limit, the particle pole interaction describes a nonlocal S-matrix element entirely supported on the light-cone, with contribution both from the dilaton pole in the trace sector and from other sectors of the correlator, except for flavour number $n_f=3$ quarks $ u,d,s$, where only the dilaton pole in the trace sector appears.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the first principles gauge theoretical construction of relativistic gapless fracton theory developed by A.~Blasi and N.~Maggiore. The difference is that, instead of considering a symmetric tensor field, we consider a vector field with a gauge group index, \emph{i.e.} the usual Einstein-Cartan variable used in the first order formalism of gravity. After discussing the most general quadratic action for this field, we explore the physical sectors contained in the model. Particularly, we show that the model contains not only linear gravity and fractons, but also ordinary Maxwell equations, suggesting an apparent electrically charged phase of, for instance, spin liquids and glassy dynamical systems. Moreover, by a suitable change of field variables, we recover the Blasi-Maggiore gauge model of fractons and linear gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometrodynamics of a 2D Curved Surface due to a Constrained Quantum Particle via its Gravitational Dual: $\mathbf{\mathcal{S}^2}$ Analytical Model Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unique and novel extension of da Costa's calculation of a quantum mechanically constrained particle. This is achieved by analyzing the perturbative back reaction of the quantum confined particle's eigenstates and spectra upon the geometry of the curved surface itself, thereby addressing the problem of shape optimization in this model. We do this by first formulating a two-dimensional action principle of the quantum constrained particle, which upon variation of the wave function reproduces Schr\"odinger's equation including da Costa's surface curvature-induced potentials. We further demonstrate that our derived action principle is dual to a two-dimensional dilation gravity theory and we vary its functional with respect to the embedded two-dimensional inverse-metric to obtain the respective geometrodynamical Einstein equation. We solve this resulting Einstein equation perturbatively by first solving the da Costa's Schr\"odinger equation to obtain an initial eigensystem, which is used as initial-input data for a perturbed metric inserted into the derived Einstein equation. As a proof of concept, we perform this calculation on a two-sphere and show its first iterative perturbed shape evolution. We also turn on external electromagnetic fields and formulate the full field theoretic field equations for future investigation. The external fields manifest themselves via a surface induced, pulled-back $U(1)$ coupling in our two-dimensional dual gravity theory, thereby revealing interesting and rich new surface physics in this specific paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum photon effects in vacuum provide an interesting setting to test quantum electrodynamics, serving as a source for predictions about physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate these effects by calculating the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like effective action within a Lorentz-violating scalar quantum electrodynamics framework. In both CPT-even and CPT-odd scenarios, we obtain the exact result in all orders of the stress tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ and evaluate explicitly the lower orders of this effective action. We identify the quantum effects coming from Lorentz violation in an explicitly gauge invariant way. Nonlinear Lorentz-violating contributions that may affect photon-photon scattering are explicitly evaluated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study in detail various solutions, especially kink ones, in different nonlocal scalar field theories, whose kinetic term is described by an arbitrary non-polynomial analytic function of the d'Alembertian operator, and the potential is chosen either to be quadratic or to allow for the kink-like solution. Using the perturbative method, we find corrections of first and second orders in the nonlocality parameter around local solutions for several form factors and generate analytic expressions for the energy density up to the first order in this parameter. Additionally, we also address an inverse problem, that is, we reconstruct the potential corresponding to the given solution obtaining restrictions for the form factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the spectral decomposition of field operators in bosonic quantum field theory as a limit of a strongly continuous family of positive-operator-valued measure decompositions. The latter arise from integrals over families of bounded positive operators. Crucially, these operators have the same locality properties as the underlying field operators. We use the decompositions to construct families of quantum operations implementing measurements of the field observables. Again, the quantum operations have the same locality properties as the field operators. What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.</description>

Theor. 53 445008) [arXiv:2007.04603]. The correction requires the use of a different method than in the original paper, and we give here full details about the method. We then report the updated numerics for critical exponents of the Ising model, vector model, cubic model and bifundamental model. Mathematica files for the numerical evaluation of the corrected diagram are provided in ancillary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for diffusion including the lowest non-hydrodynamic degree of freedom from holographic Gubser-Rocha systems. At low temperature the dynamical non-hydrodynamic mode could be either an IR mode or a slow mode, which is related to IR quantum critical excitations or encodes the information of all energy scales. This additional dynamical vector mode could be viewed as an ultraviolet sector of the diffusive hydrodynamic theory. We construct two different effective actions for each case and discuss their physical properties. In particular we show that the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry is preserved.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the large-N limit of the BMN matrix model with classical bosonic membranes which have spherical topologies and spin inside the 11-dimensional maximally supersymmetric plane-wave background. First we classify all possible M2-brane configurations based on the distribution of their components inside the SO(3)xSO(6) symmetric plane-wave spacetime. We then formulate a number of simple but very representative ansatzes of dielectric tops that rotate in this space. We examine the leading-order radial and angular/multipole stability for a wide range of these configurations. By analyzing perturbations at the next-to-leading order, we find that they exhibit the phenomenon of turbulent cascading of instabilities. Thereby, long-wavelength perturbations generate higher-order multipole instabilities through their nonlinear couplings.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the chiral spectra on charged 1- and 5-branes in the 10d non-supersymmetric $\mathfrak{sp}(16)$ string theory (also known as the Sugimoto model), and verify that they consistently cancel the anomaly inflow induced by a Green--Schwarz mechanism in the bulk. By analyzing the $\mathfrak{sp}(16)$ representations arising from quantizing the fermion zero modes on these branes as well as uncharged 4-branes, we find compelling evidence that the global structure of the gauge group is $Sp(16)/\mathbb{Z}_2$. We further comment on a possible duality to non-supersymmetric heterotic strings, and explore bottom-up anomaly inflow constraints for 10d effective $Sp(16)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories coupled to gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced a symmetry on the structure of angular momentum which interchanges internal and external degrees of freedom. The spin-orbit duality is a holographic map that projects a massive theory in four-dimensional flat spacetime onto the three-dimensional $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ null infinity. This cylinder has radius $R\sim1/m$ and, quantum-mechanically, its vacuum state is a fuzzy sphere. Progress shows that, first, this duality realizes the Hopf map, a fact manifest on the superparticle. Secondly, the bulk Poincar\`e group transforms into the conformal group on the cylinder. In fact, the general version of the duality yields that the dual symmetries include the BMS group, as is appropriate at null infinity. As an example, the Landau levels in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are shown to match those of a Dirac monopole on the dual $\mathbb{S}^2$, in the thermodynamic limit. This dual system is actually identified with a three-dimensional critical Ising model. The map is then realized on $N_f$ massive fermions in flat space which, indeed, are the hologram of $2N_f$ massless fermions on the cylinder. However, the dual space is really the conformal class of $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}$, naturally enclosing the universal cover of a conformally compactified AdS$_4$ spacetime. We argue that, in the absence of interactions, the massless fermions on the conformal boundary are in turn dual to $N_f$ massive fermions in AdS$_4$. For free fermions, all path integrals $-$the ones in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and AdS$_4-$ are shown to match. Hence, AdS/CFT duality emerges into a larger context, where one holography nests inside the other, suggesting a complete holographic bridge between fields in flat space and the AdS superstring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear field equations for the supersymmetric higher-spin gauge theory describing totally symmetric bosonic and fermionic massless fields along with hook-type bosonic fields of all spins in any space-time dimension are presented. One of the novel features of the proposed formalism is that the $osp(1,2)$ invariance and factorisation conditions are formulated within the BRST formalism, that greatly simplifies the form of nonlinear HS equations. To match the list of vertices found by Metsaev, higher-spin gauge theory is anticipated to possess an infinite number of independent coupling constants. A conjecture that these coupling constants result from the locality restrictions on the elements of the factorisation ideal is put forward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>

Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points, and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary states.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quantum Yang--Mills at finite temperature beyond lattice: a Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Dyson--Schwinger approach, we perform an analysis of the non-trivial ground state of thermal $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory in the non-perturbative regime where chiral symmetry is dynamically broken by a mass gap. Basic thermodynamic observables such as energy density and pressure are derived analytically, using Jacobi elliptic functions. The results are compared with lattice results. Good agreement is found at low temperatures, providing a viable scenario of a gas of massive glue states populating higher levels of the spectrum of the theory. At high temperatures a scenario without glue states consistent with a massive scalar field is observed, showing an interesting agreement with lattice data. The possibility is discussed that the results derived in this analysis open up a novel pathway beyond lattice to precision studies of phase transitions with false vacuum and cosmological relics that depend on the equations of state in strong coupled gauge theories of the type of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect contains great amount of theoretical importance in various branches of physics. Requirement of very high acceleration hinders its experimental evidence. We put forward an idea to experimentally probe this effect by utilizing the Pancharatnam-Berry phase of an accelerated atom in presence of mirrors. We show that for much lower accelerations, the phase gets significantly enhanced in the presence of mirrors. We propose a schematic design of an interferometric set-up to experimentally capture this effect by utilizing the phase difference between an accelerated and an inertial atoms. For the choice of hydrogen atoms and suitable separation between atoms and mirrors, the required acceleration can be very low.</description>

      <title>Geometric measure of quantum complexity in cosmological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum complexity, the introduction of a suitable geometrical space, based on the Lie group formed by fundamental operators, facilitates the identification of complexity through geodesic distance in the group manifold. Earlier work has shown that the computation of geodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic oscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an expansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for an upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar field on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as a function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble scales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de Sitter complexity. It demonstrates the consistent application of Nielsen complexity to quantum fields in cosmological backgrounds and paves the way for further applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A charged particle in a suitably strong magnetic field spirals along the field lines while slowly drifting transversely. This note provides a brief derivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding-centre approximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It also explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields, admit a 'quasi-symmetry' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful for plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this note is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well-established subject.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the aim of producing significant number of primordial black holes, over the past few years, there has been a considerable interest in examining models of inflation involving a single, canonical field, that permit a brief period of ultra slow roll. Earlier, we had examined inflationary magnetogenesis - achieved by breaking the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action through a coupling to the inflaton - in situations involving departures from slow roll. We had found that a transition from slow roll to ultra slow roll inflation can lead to a strong blue tilt in the spectrum of the magnetic field over small scales and also considerably suppress its strength over large scales. In this work, we consider the scenario of pure ultra slow roll inflation and show that scale invariant magnetic fields can be obtained in such situations with the aid of a non-conformal coupling function that depends on the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Apart from the power spectrum, an important probe of the primordial magnetic fields are the three-point functions, specifically, the cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields. We calculate the three-point cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation for the new choice of the non-conformal coupling function. In particular, we examine the validity of the consistency condition that is expected to govern the three-point function in the squeezed limit and comment on the wider implications of the results we obtain.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Polarizability of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear response of a Schwarzschild black hole to an external quadrupolar perturbation is studied in analogy to a mechanical electrodynamical system, with the goal to describe the gravitational polarizability. Its causality properties imply dispersion relations that relate fluctuation and dissipative properties. We review and combine results obtained via the Regge-Wheeler equation on one side and a perturbative, worldline effective field theory description on the other, obtaining a consistent description of the dispersion relations for the gravitational polarizability of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the classical part of the 2-point correlation function of the black hole multipole depends on the boundary conditions of the space-time the black hole is immersed in, which is relevant for the dispersion relations considered.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q)$ a the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation of a Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q) \Psi\left(\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $q=\zeta_p$. As a byproduct, we show that the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q )$ from the $q$-difference equation on $X$: $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\textbf{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\textbf{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} ,\textbf{a},q) $$ evaluated at $q=\zeta_p$ has the same eigenvalues as ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^p)$.
  Upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation of $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field of finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding quantum connection whreas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we give an explicit description of the spectrum of the $p$-curvature of quantum connection for Nakajima varieties.</description>

      <title>The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

      <title>Rationalisation of multiple square roots in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals are very often computed from their differential equations. It is not uncommon that the $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation contains only dlog-forms with algebraic arguments, where the algebraic part is given by (multiple) square roots. It is well-known that if all square roots are simultaneously rationalisable, the Feynman integrals can be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. This is a sufficient, but not a necessary criterium. In this paper we investigate weaker requirements. We discuss under which conditions we may use different rationalisations in different parts of the calculation. In particular we show that we may use different rationalisations if they correspond to different parameterisations of the same integration path. We present a non-trivial example -- the one-loop pentagon function with three adjacent massive external legs involving seven square roots -- where this technique can be used to express the result in terms of multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Time operator from parametrization invariance and implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the parametrization invariance of cosmological Lagrangians and their equivalence to systems describing the motion of particles in curved backgrounds, we identify the phase space analogue of the notion of proper time. We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate. Finally, we derive the generic expression for the introduced time variable in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>
