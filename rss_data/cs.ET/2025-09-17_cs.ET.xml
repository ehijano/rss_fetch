      <title>Oscillator Formulations of Many NP Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently optimizing Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP) problems in polynomial time has profound implications in many domains. CMOS oscillator networks have been shown to be effective and efficient in approximating certain NP-hard problems such as minimization of Potts Hamiltonian, and computational complexity theory guarantees that any NP problem can be reduced to it. In this paper, we formulate a variety of NP problems using first-order and multi-phase Potts Hamiltonian. We also propose a 3-state asymmetrically weighted oscillator optimizer design to optimize the problems. Building on existing knowledge in CMOS design, our proposed algorithms offer a promising pathway for large-scale optimization of NP problems.</description>

      <title>Analytical Modelling of the Transport in Analog Filamentary Conductive-Metal-Oxide/HfOx ReRAM Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent co-optimization of memristive technologies and programming algorithms enabled neural networks training with in-memory computing systems. In this context, novel analog filamentary conductive-metal-oxide (CMO)/HfOx redox-based resistive switching memory (ReRAM) represents a key technology. Despite device performance enhancements reported in literature, the underlying mechanism behind resistive switching is not fully understood. This work presents the first physics-based analytical model of the current transport and of the resistive switching in these devices. As a case study, analog TaOx/HfOx ReRAM devices are considered. The current transport is explained by a trap-to-trap tunneling process, and the resistive switching by a modulation of the defect density within the sub-band of the TaOx that behaves as electric field and temperature confinement layer. The local temperature and electric field distributions are derived from the solution of the electric and heat transport equations in a 3D finite element ReRAM model. The intermediate resistive states are described as a gradual modulation of the TaOx defect density, which results in a variation of its electrical conductivity. The drift-dynamics of ions during the resistive switching is analytically described, allowing the estimation of defect migration energies in the TaOx layer. Moreover, the role of the electro-thermal properties of the CMO layer is unveiled. The proposed analytical model accurately describes the experimental switching characteristic of analog TaOx/HfOx ReRAM devices, increasing the physical understanding and providing the equations necessary for circuit simulations incorporating this technology.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Pipeline for Interactive Prompt-driven 2D-to-3D Vascular Reconstruction for Fontan Geometries from Contrast-Enhanced X-Ray Fluoroscopy Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fontan palliation for univentricular congenital heart disease progresses to hemodynamic failure with complex flow patterns poorly characterized by conventional 2D imaging. Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning.
  A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.
  The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.
  This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.</description>

      <title>A neuromorphic continuous soil monitoring system for precision irrigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensory processing at the edge requires ultra-low power stand-alone computing technologies. This is particularly true for modern agriculture and precision irrigation systems which aim to optimize water usage by monitoring key environmental observables continuously using distributed efficient embedded processing elements. Neuromorphic processing systems are emerging as a promising technology for extreme edge-computing applications that need to run on resource-constrained hardware. As such, they are a very good candidate for implementing efficient water management systems based on data measured from soil and plants, across large fields. In this work, we present a fully energy-efficient neuromorphic irrigation control system that operates autonomously without any need for data transmission or remote processing. Leveraging the properties of a biologically realistic spiking neural network, our system performs computation, and decision-making locally. We validate this approach using real-world soil moisture data from apple and kiwi orchards applied to a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor, and show that the generated irrigation commands closely match those derived from conventional methods across different soil depths. Our results show that local neuromorphic inference can maintain decision accuracy, paving the way for autonomous, sustainable irrigation solutions at scale.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Alpha-Particle-Immune Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA-FET) Based SRAM Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, using 3D Technology Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD) simulations, we show that it is possible to design a static random-access memory (SRAM) using gate-all-around field-effect-transistor (GAA-FET) technology so that it is immune to single alpha particle radiation error. In other words, with the design, there will be no single-event upset (SEU) due to alpha particles. We first use ab initio calculations in PHITS to show that there is a maximum linear energy transfer (LET), LETmax, for the alpha particle in Si and Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$. Based on that, by designing a sub-7nm GAA-FET-based SRAM with bottom dielectric isolation (BDI), we show that the SRAM does not flip even if the particle strike is in the worst-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Vector Symbolic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time robotic systems require advanced perception, computation, and action capability. However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. In this study, we propose a vector symbolic architecture-based OGM system (VSA-OGM) that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while reducing latency by approximately 45x and memory by 400x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 5.5x. Moreover, we achieve up to 6x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training. This work demonstrates the potential of vector symbolic architectures as a practical foundation for real-time probabilistic mapping in autonomous systems operating under strict computational and latency constraints.</description>

      <title>Spike Encoding for Environmental Sound: A Comparative Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy efficient processing suitable for edge applications, but conventional sensor data must first be converted into spike trains for neuromorphic processing. Environmental sound, including urban soundscapes, poses challenges due to variable frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events, while most spike based audio encoding research has focused on speech. This paper analyzes three spike encoding methods, Threshold Adaptive Encoding (TAE), Step Forward (SF), and Moving Window (MW) across three datasets: ESC10, UrbanSound8K, and TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes. Our multiband analysis shows that TAE consistently outperforms SF and MW in reconstruction quality, both per frequency band and per class across datasets. Moreover, TAE yields the lowest spike firing rates, indicating superior energy efficiency. For downstream environmental sound classification with a standard SNN, TAE also achieves the best performance among the compared encoders. Overall, this work provides foundational insights and a comparative benchmark to guide the selection of spike encoders for neuromorphic environmental sound processing.</description>
