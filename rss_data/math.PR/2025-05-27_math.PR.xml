      <title>Simple parallel estimation of the partition ratio for Gibbs distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the partition function $Z(\beta)=\sum_x \exp(\beta(H(x))$ of a Gibbs distribution with the Hamiltonian $H:\Omega\rightarrow\{0\}\cup[1,n]$. As shown in [Harris &amp; Kolmogorov 2024], the log-ratio $q=\ln (Z(\beta_{\max})/Z(\beta_{\min}))$ can be estimated with accuracy $\epsilon$ using $O(\frac{q \log n}{\epsilon^2})$ calls to an oracle that produces a sample from the Gibbs distribution for parameter $\beta\in[\beta_{\min},\beta_{\max}]$. That algorithm is inherently sequential, or {\em adaptive}: the queried values of $\beta$ depend on previous samples. Recently, [Liu, Yin &amp; Zhang 2024] developed a non-adaptive version that needs $O( q (\log^2 n) (\log q + \log \log n + \epsilon^{-2}) )$ samples.
  We improve the number of samples to $O(\frac{q \log^2 n}{\epsilon^2})$ for a non-adaptive algorithm, and to $O(\frac{q \log n}{\epsilon^2})$ for an algorithm that uses just two rounds of adaptivity (matching the complexity of the sequential version). Furthermore, our algorithm simplifies previous techniques. In particular, we use just a single estimator, whereas methods in [Harris &amp; Kolmogorov 2024, Liu, Yin &amp; Zhang 2024] employ two different estimators for different regimes.</description>

      <title>Clark-Ocone formula for the maximum of processes with the stochastic intensity and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pricing of the lookback options using the Clark-Ocone formula for the underlying assets driven by stochastic L\'evy processes requires computing the Malliavin derivatives of their maximum or minimum on the Wiener-Poisson space and their distributions. In this work, we will find a generalization of the explicit representation of the Clark-Ocone formula on the maximum of two types of L\'evy processes with stochastic intensity: Cox processes with CIR-modeled intensities, and the Hawkes processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal stopping involving a diffusion and its running maximum: a generalisation of the maximality principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximality principle has been a valuable tool in identifying the free-boundary functions that are associated with the solutions to several optimal stopping problems involving one-dimensional time-homogeneous diffusions and their running maximum processes. In its original form, the maximality principle identifies an optimal stopping boundary function as the maximal solution to a specific first-order nonlinear ODE that stays strictly below the diagonal in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In the context of a suitably tailored optimal stopping problem, we derive a substantial generalisation of the maximality principle: the optimal stopping boundary function is the maximal solution to a specific first-order nonlinear ODE that is associated with a solution to the optimal stopping problem's variational inequality.</description>

      <title>Particle Systems with Local Interactions via Hitting Times and Cascades on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particle systems interacting via hitting times on sparsely connected graphs, following the framework of Lacker, Ramanan and Wu (2023). We provide general robustness conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of physical solutions to the dynamics, and demonstrate their connections to the dynamic percolation theory. We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.</description>

      <title>The Kinetic Limit of Balanced Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of Balanced Neural Networks is a very popular explanation for the high degree of variability and stochasticity in the brain's activity. Roughly speaking, it entails that typical neurons receive many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The network-wide mean inputs cancel, and one is left with the stochastic fluctuations about the mean. In this paper we determine kinetic equations that describe the population density. The intrinsic dynamics is nonlinear, with multiplicative noise perturbing the state of each neuron. The equations have a spatial dimension, such that the strength-of-connection between neurons is a function of their spatial position. Our method of proof is to decompose the state variables into (i) the network-wide average activity, and (ii) fluctuations about this mean. In the limit, we determine two coupled limiting equations. The requirement that the system be balanced yields implicit equations for the evolution of the average activity. In the large n limit, the population density of the fluctuations evolves according to a Fokker-Planck equation. If one makes an additional assumption that the intrinsic dynamics is linear and the noise is not multiplicative, then one obtains a spatially-distributed neural field equation.</description>

      <title>A partition method for bounding continuous-time Markov chain models of general reaction network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a general method to establish properties of multi-dimensional continuous-time Markov chains representing stochastic reaction networks. This method consists of grouping states together (via a partition of the state space), then constructing two one-dimensional birth and death processes that lower and upper bound the initial process under simple assumptions on the infinitesimal generators of the processes. The construction of these bounding processes is based on coupling arguments and transport theory. The bounding processes are easy to analyse analytically and numerically and allow us to derive properties on the initial continuous-time Markov chain. We focus on two important properties: the behavior of the process at infinity through the existence of a stationary distribution and the error in truncating the state space to numerically solve the master equation describing the time evolution of the probability distribution of the process. We derive explicit formulas for constructing the optimal bounding processes for a given partition, making the method easy to use in practice. We finally discuss the importance of the choice of the partition to obtain relevant results and illustrate the method on an example chemical reaction network.</description>

      <title>Residual Diffusivity for Expanding Bernoulli Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a discrete time Markov process $X^\varepsilon$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that makes a deterministic jump based on its current location, and then takes a small Gaussian step of variance $\varepsilon^2$. We study the behavior of the asymptotic variance as $\varepsilon \to 0$. In some situations (for instance if there were no jumps), then the asymptotic variance vanishes as $\varepsilon \to 0$. When the jumps are "chaotic", however, the asymptotic variance may be bounded from above and bounded away from $0$, as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This phenomenon is known as residual diffusivity, and we prove this occurs when the jumps are determined by certain expanding Bernoulli maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multidimensional random walks in pyramidal cones (or multidimensional orthants), which are intersections of a finite number of half-spaces. We explore the connection between the existence of (positive) discrete harmonic polynomials for the random walks, with Dirichlet conditions on the boundary of the cone, and geometric properties of the cone, being or not the Weyl chamber of a finite Coxeter group. We prove that the first property implies the second, derive the converse in dimension two and show in this case that it coincides with the probabilistic harmonic function.</description>

      <title>Distribution Dependent SDEs with Singular Interactions: Well-Posedness and Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of distribution dependent SDEs with singular interactions, which include the Coulomb/Riesz/Biot-Savart kernels as typical examples (Examples 2.1 and 2.2), we derive the well-posedness and regularity estimates by establishing the entropy-cost inequality. To measure the singularity of interactions, we introduce a new probability distance induced by local integrable functions, and estimate this distance for the time-marginal laws of solutions by using the Wasserstein distance of initial distributions. A key point of the study is to characterize the path space of time-marginal distributions for the solutions, by using local hyperbound estimates on diffusion semigroups.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamical fluctuations in reaction-diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional microscopic reaction-diffusion process obtained as a superposition of a Glauber and a Kawasaki dynamics. The reaction term is tuned so that a dynamical phase transition occurs in the model as a suitable parameter is varied. We study dynamical fluctuations of the density field at the critical point.
  We characterise the slowdown of the dynamics at criticality, and prove that this slowdown is induced by a single observable, the global density (or magnetisation). We show that magnetisation fluctuations are non-Gaussian and characterise their limit as the solution of a non-linear SDE. We prove, furthermore, that other observables remain fast: the density field acting on the fast modes (i.e. on mean-0 test functions) and with Gaussian scaling converges, in the sense of finite dimensional distributions, to a Gaussian field with space-time covariance that we compute explicitly.
  The proof relies on a decoupling of slow and fast modes relying in particular on a relative entropy argument. Major technical difficulties include the fact that local equilibrium does not hold due to the non-linearity, and proving replacement estimates on diverging time intervals due to critical slowdown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take scaling limits of the Bouchaud and Dean trap model on Parisi's tree in time scales where the dynamics is either ergodic (close to equilibrium) or aging (far from equilibrium). These results follow from a continuity theorem formulated for a certain kind of process on trees, which we call a cascading jump evolution, defined in terms of a collection of jump functions, with a cascading structure given by the tree.</description>

      <title>Second Order Properties of Thinned Counts in Finite Birth--Death Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the counting process arising as a subset of births and deaths in a birth--death process on a finite state space. Whenever a birth or death occurs, the process is incremented or not depending on the outcome of an independent Bernoulli experiment whose probability is a state-dependent function of the birth and death and also depends on whether it is a birth or death that has occurred. We establish a formula for the asymptotic variance rate of this process, also presented as the ratio of the asymptotic variance and the asymptotic mean. Several examples including queueing models illustrate the scope of applicability of the results. An analogous formula for the countably infinite state space is conjectured and tested.</description>

      <title>From one-dimensional diffusion processes metastable behaviour to parabolic equations asymptotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the one-dimensional elliptic operator given by \begin{equation*} (L_\epsilon f)(x) \;=\; b (x) \, f'(x) \,+\, \epsilon\, a (x)\, f''(x) \;, \end{equation*} where the drift $b\colon R \to R$ and the diffusion coefficient $a\colon R \to R$ are periodic $C^1(R)$ functions satisfying further conditions, and $\epsilon&gt;0$. Consider the initial-valued problem \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp; \partial_{t}\,u_{\epsilon}\,=\,L_{\epsilon}\,u_{\epsilon}\;,\\ &amp; u_{\epsilon}(0,\,\cdot)=u_{0}(\cdot)\;, \end{aligned} \right.\end{equation*} for some bounded continuous function $u_{0}$. We prove the existence of time-scales $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(1)},\,\dots,\,\theta_{\epsilon}^{(\mathfrak{q})}$ such that $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(1)}\to\infty$, $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p+1)}/\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p)}\to\infty$, $1\le p\le\mathfrak{q}-1$, probability measures $p(x,\cdot)$, $x\in R$, and kernels $R_{t}^{(p)}(m_j,m_k)$, where $\{m_j:j\in Z\}$ represents the set of stable equilibrium of the ODE $\dot{x}(t) = b(x(t))$ such that \begin{equation*} \lim_{\epsilon\to0} u_{\epsilon}(t\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p)}, x) \;=\;\sum_{j,k\in Z} p(x,m_j)\, R_{t}^{(p)} (m_j,m_k) \,u_{0}(m_k)\;, \end{equation*} for all $t&gt;0$ and $x\in R$. The solution $u_{\epsilon}$ asymptotic behavior description is completed by the characterisation of its behaviour in the intermediate time-scales $\varrho_{\epsilon}$ such that $\varrho_{\epsilon}/\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p)}\to\infty$, $\varrho_{\epsilon}/\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p+1)}\to0$ for some $0\le p\le\mathfrak{q}$, where $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(0)}=1$, $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(\mathfrak{q}+1)}=+\infty$.
  The proof relies on the analysis of the diffusion $X_\epsilon(\cdot)$ induced by the generator $L_\epsilon$ based on the resolvent approach to metastability introduced in [21].</description>

      <title>Source identification via pathwise gradient estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of PDE-constrained optimization theory, source identification problems traditionally entail particles emerging from an unknown source distribution inside a domain, moving according to a prescribed stochastic process, e.g.~Brownian motion, and then exiting through the boundary of a compact domain. Given information about the flux of particles through the boundary of the domain, the challenge is to infer as much as possible about the source.
  In the PDE setting, it is usually assumed that the flux can be observed without error and at all points on the boundary. Here we consider a different, more statistical presentation of the model, in which the data has the form of discrete counts of particles arriving at a set of disjoint detectors whose union is a strict subset of the boundary. In keeping with the primacy of the stochastic processes in the generation of the model, we present a gradient descent algorithm in which exit rates and parameter sensitivities are computed by simulations of particle paths. We present examples for both It\^o diffusion and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes, noting that the form of the sensitivities depends only on the parameterization of the source distribution and is universal among a large class of Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Backward Filtering Forward Guiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general methodological framework for probabilistic inference in discrete- and continuous-time stochastic processes evolving on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The process is observed only at the leaf nodes, and the challenge is to infer its full latent trajectory: a smoothing problem that arises in fields such as phylogenetics, epidemiology, and signal processing. Our approach combines a backward information filtering step, which constructs likelihood-informed potentials from observations, with a forward guiding step, where a tractable process is simulated under a change of measure constructed from these potentials. This Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) scheme yields weighted samples from the posterior distribution over latent paths and is amenable to integration with MCMC and particle filtering methods. We demonstrate that BFFG applies to both discrete- and continuous-time models, enabling probabilistic inference in settings where standard transition densities are intractable or unavailable. Our framework opens avenues for incorporating structured stochastic dynamics into probabilistic programming. We numerically illustrate our approach for a branching diffusion process on a directed tree.</description>

      <title>Representative Action Selection for Large Action-Space Meta-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work concerns notions of multi-algebra independence introduced by Liu and how they can be studied in the context of bi-free probability. In particular, we show how the free-free-Boolean independence for triples of algebras can be embedded intro and therefore studied from a lens of bi-free probability. It is also shown how its cumulants can be constructed from the bi-free cumulants.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence in the Free Multiplicative Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first quantitative estimates for the rate of convergence in the free multiplicative central limit theorem (CLT), in terms of the Kolmogorov and $r$-Wasserstein distances for $r \geq 1$. While the free additive CLT has been thoroughly studied, including convergence rates, the multiplicative setting remained open in this regard. We consider products of the form $$ \pi_n^{g,n^{-1/2}x} := g\left(\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \cdots g\left(\frac{x_n}{\sqrt{n}}\right),$$ where $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are freely independent self-adjoint operators with common variance $\sigma^2$ and $g \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ satisfies certain regularity and integrability conditions. We quantify the deviation of the singular value distribution of $\pi_n^{g,x}$ from the free positive semicircular law, with bounds depending only on the moments of the underlying variables. Additionally, we present a combinatorial proof of the free multiplicative CLT that extends to the unbounded setting.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of vanishing viscosity approximations to mean field games with non-separable Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the vanishing viscosity approximation to mean field games (MFGs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonlocal and possibly non-separable Hamiltonian. We prove that the value function converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\beta)$, where $\beta^2$ is the diffusivity constant, which matches the classical convergence rate of vanishing viscosity for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. The same rate is also obtained for the approximation of the distribution of players as well as for the gradient of the value function. The proof is a combination of probabilistic and analytical arguments by first analyzing the forward-backward stochastic differential equation associated with the MFG, and then applying a general stability result for HJ equations. Applications of our result to $N$-player games, mean field control, and policy iteration for solving MFGs are also presented.</description>

      <title>Convergence, Sticking and Escape: Stochastic Dynamics Near Critical Points in SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence properties and escape dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in one-dimensional landscapes, separately considering infinite- and finite-variance noise. Our main focus is to identify the time scales on which SGD reliably moves from an initial point to the local minimum in the same ''basin''. Under suitable conditions on the noise distribution, we prove that SGD converges to the basin's minimum unless the initial point lies too close to a local maximum. In that near-maximum scenario, we show that SGD can linger for a long time in its neighborhood. For initial points near a ''sharp'' maximum, we show that SGD does not remain stuck there, and we provide results to estimate the probability that it will reach each of the two neighboring minima. Overall, our findings present a nuanced view of SGD's transitions between local maxima and minima, influenced by both noise characteristics and the underlying function geometry.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Randomness recycling'' is a powerful algorithmic technique for reusing a fraction of the random information consumed by a randomized algorithm to reduce its entropy requirements. This article presents a family of efficient randomness recycling algorithms for sampling a sequence $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots$ of discrete random variables whose joint distribution follows an arbitrary stochastic process. We develop randomness recycling strategies to reduce the entropy cost of a variety of prominent sampling algorithms, which include uniform sampling, inverse transform sampling, lookup table sampling, alias sampling, and discrete distribution generating (DDG) tree sampling. Our method achieves an expected amortized entropy cost of $H(X_1,\dots,X_k)/k + \varepsilon$ input random bits per output sample using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space, which is arbitrarily close to the optimal Shannon entropy rate. The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improve upon the Han and Hoshi interval algorithm and Knuth and Yao entropy-optimal algorithm for sampling a discrete random sequence. An empirical evaluation of the algorithm shows that it achieves state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant random sampling library in the C programming language.</description>

      <title>On the transmission of texts: written cultures as complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in graphon mean field games and their applications, this paper provides a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of graphon mean field control (GMFC) problems, where the controlled dynamics are governed by a graphon mean field stochastic differential equation with heterogeneous mean field interactions. We formulate the GMFC problem with general graphon mean field dependence and establish the existence and uniqueness of the associated graphon mean field forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We then derive a version of the Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle tailored to GMFC problems. Furthermore, we analyze the solvability of the GMFC problem for linear dynamics and study the continuity and stability of the graphon mean field FBSDEs under the optimal control profile. Finally, we show that the solution to the GMFC problem provides an approximately optimal solution for large systems with heterogeneous mean field interactions, based on a propagation of chaos result.</description>

      <title>On the Relation between Rectified Flows and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the connections between rectified flows, flow matching, and optimal transport. Flow matching is a recent approach to learning generative models by estimating velocity fields that guide transformations from a source to a target distribution. Rectified flow matching aims to straighten the learned transport paths, yielding more direct flows between distributions. Our first contribution is a set of invariance properties of rectified flows and explicit velocity fields. In addition, we also provide explicit constructions and analysis in the Gaussian (not necessarily independent) and Gaussian mixture settings and study the relation to optimal transport. Our second contribution addresses recent claims suggesting that rectified flows, when constrained such that the learned velocity field is a gradient, can yield (asymptotically) solutions to optimal transport problems. We study the existence of solutions for this problem and demonstrate that they only relate to optimal transport under assumptions that are significantly stronger than those previously acknowledged. In particular, we present several counter-examples that invalidate earlier equivalence results in the literature, and we argue that enforcing a gradient constraint on rectified flows is, in general, not a reliable method for computing optimal transport maps.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a method for modeling and forecasting mortality rates. It constitutes an improvement over previous studies by incorporating both the historical evolution of the mortality phenomenon and its random behavior. In the first part, we introduce the model and analyze mathematical properties such as the existence of solutions and their asymptotic behavior. In the second part, we apply this model to forecast mortality rates in Spain, showing that it yields better results than classical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00121v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest Queue (JSQ) policy is a classical benchmark for the performance of many-server queueing systems due to its strong optimality properties. While the exact analysis of the JSQ policy is an open question to date, even under Markovian assumption on the service requirements, recently, there has been a significant progress in understanding its many-server asymptotic behavior since the work of Eschenfeldt and Gamarnik (Math.~Oper.~Res.~43 (2018) 867--886).
  In this paper, we analyze the many-server limits of the JSQ policy in the \emph{super-Halfin-Whitt} scaling window when load per server $\lambda_N$ scales with the system size $N$ as $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}N^{\alpha}(1-\lambda_N)=\beta$ for $\alpha\in (1/2, 1)$ and $\beta&gt;0$. We establish that the centered and scaled total queue length process converges to a certain Bessel process with negative drift and the associated centered and scaled steady-state total queue length, indexed by $N$, converges to a $\mathrm{Gamma}(2,\beta)$ distribution. Both the transient and steady-state limit laws are universal in the sense that they do not depend on the value of the scaling parameter $\alpha$, and exhibit fundamentally different qualitative behavior from both the Halfin-Whitt regime ($\alpha = 1/2$) and the Non-degenerate Slowdown (NDS) regime ($\alpha=1$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1987 Graeme Segal gave a functorial definition of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) that was designed to capture the mathematical essence of the Conformal Bootstrap formalism pioneered in physics by Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov. In Segal's formulation the basic objects of CFT, the correlation functions of conformal primary fields, are viewed as functions on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with marked points which behave naturally under gluing of surfaces. In this paper we give a probabilistic realization of Segal's axioms in Liouville Conformal Field Theory (LCFT) which is a CFT that plays a fundamental role in the theory of random surfaces and two dimensional quantum gravity. Then we use Segal's axioms to express the correlation functions of LCFT in terms of the basic objects of LCFT: its {\it spectrum} and its {\it structure constants}, determined in earlier works by the authors. As a consequence, we obtain a formula for the correlation functions as multiple integrals over the spectrum of LCFT, the structure of these integrals being associated to a pant decomposition of the surface. The integrand is the modulus squared of a function called conformal block: its structure is encoded by the commutation relations of an algebra of operators called the Virasoro algebra and it depends holomorphically on the moduli of the surface with marked points. The integration measure involves a product of structure constants, which have an explicit expression, the so called DOZZ formula.</description>

Abstract: Cluster random fields (CRFs) play a crucial role in the study of extremes of stationary regularly varying random fields (RFs). In particular, they appear in the Rosi\'nski representation of max-stable and $\alpha$-stable RFs. In this contribution we introduce CRFs in an abstract setting proving that they are crucial for the construction of shift-generated classes of $\alpha$-homogeneous RFs. Further, we investigate the relations between CRFs, tail RFs} and spectral tail RFs. Applications discussed in this contribution include new representations of extremal functional indices and purely dissipative max-stable RFs.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility and ergodicity of SPDEs driven by pure jump noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The irreducibility is fundamental for the study of ergodicity of stochastic dynamical systems. The existing methods on the irreducibility of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by pure jump noise are basically along the same lines as that for the Gaussian case, which are not particularly suitable for jump noise. As a result, restrictive conditions are usually placed on the driving jump noise. Basically the driving noises are additive type and more or less in the class of stable processes. In this paper, we develop a new and effective method to obtain the irreducibility of SPDEs and SDEs driven by multiplicative pure jump noise. The conditions placed on the coefficients and the driving noise are very mild, and in some sense they are necessary and sufficient. As an application of our main results, we remove all the restrictive conditions on the driving noises in the literature,and derive new irreducibility results of a large class of equations driven by pure jump noise, including SPDEs with locally monotone coefficients, SPDEs/SDEs with singular coefficients, nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, etc. We emphasize that under our setting the driving noises could be compound Poisson processes, even allowed to be infinite dimensional. As further applications of the main results, we obtain the ergodicity of multi-valued, singular stochastic evolution inclusions such as stochastic 1-Laplacian evolution (total variation flow), stochastic sign fast diffusion equation, stochastic minimal surface flow, stochastic curve shortening flow, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction networks have become a major modelling framework in the biological sciences from epidemiology and population biology to genetics and cellular biology. In recent years, much progress has been made on stochastic reaction networks (SRNs), modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) and their stationary distributions. We are interested in complex-balanced stationary distributions, where the probability flow out of a complex equals the flow into the complex. We characterise the existence and the form of complex-balanced distributions of SRNs with arbitrary transition functions through conditions on the cycles of the reaction graph (a digraph). Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of a complex-balanced distribution and give precise conditions for when it is also necessary. The sufficient condition is also necessary for mass-action kinetics (and certain generalisations of that) or if the connected components of the digraph are cycles. Moreover, we state a deficiency theorem, a generalisation of the deficiency theorem for stochastic mass-action kinetics to arbitrary stochastic kinetics. The theorem gives the co-dimension of the parameter space for which a complex-balanced distribution exists. To achieve this, we construct an iterative procedure to decompose a strongly connected reaction graph into disjoint cycles, such that the corresponding SRN has equivalent dynamics and preserves complex-balancedness, provided the original SRN had so. This decomposition might have independent interest and might be applicable to edge-labelled digraphs in general.</description>

      <title>Strong Topological Trivialization of Multi-Species Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the landscapes of multi-species spherical spin glasses. Our results determine the phase boundary for annealed trivialization of the number of critical points, and establish its equivalence with a quenched strong topological trivialization property. Namely in the "trivial" regime, the number of critical points is constant, all are well-conditioned, and all approximate critical points are close to a true critical point. As a consequence, we deduce that Langevin dynamics at sufficiently low temperature has logarithmic mixing time.
  Our approach begins with the Kac--Rice formula. We characterize the annealed trivialization phase by explicitly solving a suitable multi-dimensional variational problem, obtained by simplifying certain asymptotic determinant formulas from (Ben Arous--Bourgade--McKenna 2023, McKenna 2024). To obtain more precise quenched results, we develop general purpose techniques to avoid sub-exponential correction factors and show non-existence of approximate critical points. Many of the results are new even in the 1-species case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The periodic KPZ fixed point is the conjectural universal limit of the KPZ universality class models on a ring when both the period and time critically tend to infinity. For the case of the periodic narrow wedge initial condition, we consider the conditional distribution when the periodic KPZ fixed point is unusually large at a particular position and time. We prove a conditional limit theorem up to the ``pinch-up" time. When the period is large enough, the result is the same as that for the KPZ fixed point on the line obtained by Liu and Wang in 2022. We identify the regimes in which the result changes and find probabilistic descriptions of the limits.</description>

      <title>Background risk model in presence of heavy tails under dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine two problems on applied probability, which are directly connected with the dependence in presence of heavy tails. The first problem, is related to max-sum equivalence of the randomly weighted sums in bi-variate set up. Introducing a new dependence, called Generalized Tail Asymptotic Independence, we establish the bi-variate max-sum equivalence, under a rather general dependence structure, when the primary random variables follow distributions from the intersection of the dominatedly varying and the long tailed distributions. On base of this max-sum equivalence, we provide a result about the asymptotic behavior of two kinds of ruin probabilities, over a finite time horizon, in a bi-variate renewal risk model, with constant interest rate. The second problem, is related to the asymptotic behavior of the Tail Distortion Risk Measure, in a static portfolio, called Background Risk Model. In opposite to other approaches on this topic, we use a general enough assumption, that is based on multivariate regular variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisited the classical problem of max-sum equivalence of randomly weighted sums in two dimensions. In opposite to the most papers in literature, we consider that there exists some interdependence between the primary random variables, which is achieved by a combination of a new dependence structure with some two-dimensional heavy-tailed classes of distributions. Further, we introduce a new approach in two-dimensional regular varying distributions, that in contrast to well-established multivariate regularly varying distributions, is consistent with the multivariate non-linear single big jump principle. We study some closure properties of this, and of other two-dimensional classes. Our results contain the finite-time ruin probability in a two-dimensional discrete time risk model</description>

Abstract: Asymptotic expansions are derived for the tail distribution of the product of two correlated normal random variables with non-zero means and arbitrary variances, and more generally the sum of independent copies of such random variables.

Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus in the infinite volume limit. This measure is an invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by B. Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. We show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by B. Rider.</description>

      <title>Inference for dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs under regime switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines a model involving two dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs that evolve in parallel, with edges in each graph alternating between being present and absent according to specified on- and off-time distributions. A key feature of our setup is regime switching: the graph that is observed at any given moment depends on the state of an underlying background process, which is modeled as an alternating renewal process. This modeling framework captures a common situation in various real-world applications, where the observed network is influenced by a (typically unobservable) background process. Such scenarios arise, for example, in economics, communication networks, and biological systems.
  In our setup we only have access to aggregate quantities such as the number of active edges or the counts of specific subgraphs (such as stars or complete graphs) in the observed graph; importantly, we do not observe the mode. The objective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions of the edges in each of the two dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, as well as the distribution of time spent in each of the two modes. By employing parametric models for the on- and off-times and the background process, we develop a method of moments approach to estimate the relevant parameters. Experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recovering these parameters.</description>

      <title>A sharper Lyapunov-Katz central limit error bound for i.i.d. summands Zolotarev-close to normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a central limit error bound for convolution powers of laws with finite moments of order $r \in \mathopen]2,3\mathclose]$, taking a closeness of the laws to normality into account. Up to a universal constant, this generalises the case of $r=3$ of the sharpening of the Berry (1941) - Esseen (1942) theorem obtained by Mattner (2024), namely by sharpening here the Katz (1963) error bound for the i.i.d. case of Lyapunov's (1901) theorem. Our proof uses a partial generalisation of the theorem of Senatov and Zolotarev (1986) used for the earlier special case. A result more general than our main one could be obtained by using instead another theorem of Senatov (1980), but unfortunately an auxiliary inequality used in the latter's proof is wrong.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of higher-order conditional tail moments for convolution-equivalently distributed losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of higher-order conditional tail moments, which quantify the contribution of individual losses in the event of systemic collapse. The study is conducted within a framework comprising two investment portfolios experiencing dependent losses that follow convolution-equivalent distributions. The main results are encapsulated in two theorems: one addressing light-tailed losses with convolution-equivalent distributions and the other focusing on heavy-tailed losses with regularly varying distributions. Both results reveal that the asymptotic behavior remains robust regardless of the strength of dependence. Additionally, numerical simulations are performed under specific scenarios to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matchings on Doubly Free Boundary Rail-Yard Graph with Macdonald Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of perfect matchings on rail-yard graphs with doubly free boundary conditions and Jack weights. While a special case of this model reduces to the half space Macdonald process with Jack weights introduced by Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin [3], the asymptotic behavior in the general Jack-weighted free boundary setting considered here has, to our knowledge, remained open in the literature; perhaps due to the absence of determinantal structure and the analytic complexity of boundary interactions that distinguish this setting from previously tractable cases. Our analysis is inspired by the asymptotic framework developed around the Negut operator by Gorin, Zhang, and Ahn, but it is adapted in new directions to address the challenges posed by the fully free boundary Jack-weighted regime. In particular, we establish novel identities for Macdonald polynomials and analyze infinite-product expansions not previously studied in this context. These tools enable us to rigorously establish the existence of a limit shape and to prove that the height fluctuations converge to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF) in the liquid region. These results, to the best of our knowledge, provide the first rigorous limit shape and fluctuation analysis in Jack-weighted tiling models with general free boundary conditions. In doing so, we expand the asymptotic theory of symmetric-function-deformed models beyond previously accessible, determinantal frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive new formulas for the expectation and variance of Wilson loops for any contractible simple loop on a compact orientable surface of genus $1$ and higher, in the model of two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$. They are written in terms of a Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ introduced recently by the author and M. Ma\"ida \cite{LM3}. From these formulas, we prove a quantitative result on the convergence of the expectation and variance as $N$ tends to infinity, refining a result of the author and A. Dahlqvist \cite{DL}. We finally derive the large $g$ limit of the Wilson loop expectation and variance, by analogy with the study of integrals on moduli spaces of compact hyperbolic surfaces. Surprisingly, the variance does not vanish in this regime, but there are no nontrivial fluctuations of any order.</description>

      <title>Feasible approximation of matching equilibria for large-scale matching for teams problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm for computing approximately optimal solutions of the matching for teams problem. Our algorithm is efficient for problems involving large number of agent categories and allows for non-discrete agent type measures. Specifically, we parametrize the so-called transfer functions and develop a parametric formulation, which we tackle to produce feasible and approximately optimal primal and dual solutions. These solutions yield upper and lower bounds for the optimal value, and the difference between these bounds provides a sub-optimality estimate of the computed solutions. Moreover, we are able to control the sub-optimality to be arbitrarily close to 0. We subsequently prove that the approximate primal and dual solutions converge when the sub-optimality goes to 0 and their limits constitute a true matching equilibrium. Thus, the outputs of our algorithm are regarded as an approximate matching equilibrium. We also analyze the computational complexity of our approach. In the numerical experiments, we study three matching for teams problems: a business location distribution problem, the Wasserstein barycenter problem, and a large-scale problem involving 100 agent categories. We showcase that the proposed algorithm can produce high-quality approximate matching equilibria, provide quantitative insights about the optimal city structure in the business location distribution problem, and that the sub-optimality estimates computed by our algorithm are much less conservative than theoretical estimates.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of sampling from log-concave distributions supported on convex, compact sets, with a particular focus on the randomized midpoint discretization of both vanilla and kinetic Langevin diffusions in this constrained setting. We propose a unified proximal framework for handling constraints via a broad class of projection operators, including Euclidean, Bregman, and Gauge projections. Within this framework, we establish non-asymptotic bounds in both $\mathcal{W}_1$ and $\mathcal{W}_2$ distances, providing precise complexity guarantees and performance comparisons. In addition, our analysis leads to sharper convergence guarantees for both vanilla and kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo under constraints, improving upon existing theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in Overparametrized Neural Networks: A Mean-Field View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Mean-Field (MF) view of the learning dynamics of overparametrized Artificial Neural Networks (NN) under data symmetric in law wrt the action of a general compact group $G$. We consider for this a class of generalized shallow NNs given by an ensemble of $N$ multi-layer units, jointly trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and possibly symmetry-leveraging (SL) techniques, such as Data Augmentation (DA), Feature Averaging (FA) or Equivariant Architectures (EA). We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF dynamic, which stays in the space of WI laws and minimizes therein the population risk. We also give a counterexample to the general attainability of an optimum over SI laws. Despite this, quite remarkably, we show that the set of SI laws is also preserved by the MF dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We last deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy Algorithms for the Binary Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The binary perceptron problem asks us to find a sign vector in the intersection of independently chosen random halfspaces with intercept $-\kappa$. We analyze the performance of the canonical discrepancy minimization algorithms of Lovett-Meka and Rothvoss/Eldan-Singh for the asymmetric binary perceptron problem. We obtain new algorithmic results in the $\kappa = 0$ case and in the large-$|\kappa|$ case. In the $\kappa\to-\infty$ case, we additionally characterize the storage capacity and complement our algorithmic results with an almost-matching overlap-gap lower bound.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with discontinuous stochastic gradient with applications to training of ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence of the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm to a target measure in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distance. Crucially, compared to the existing literature on SGHMC, we allow its stochastic gradient to be discontinuous. This allows us to provide explicit upper bounds, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small, for the expected excess risk of non-convex stochastic optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients, including, among others, the training of neural networks with ReLU activation function. To illustrate the applicability of our main results, we consider numerical experiments on quantile estimation and on several optimization problems involving ReLU neural networks relevant in finance and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>The velocity jump Langevin process and its splitting scheme: long time convergence and numerical accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Langevin dynamics is a diffusion process extensively used, in particular in molecular dynamics simulations, to sample Gibbs measures. Some alternatives based on (piecewise deterministic) kinetic velocity jump processes have gained interest over the last decade. One interest of the latter is the possibility to split forces (at the continuous-time level), reducing the numerical cost for sampling the trajectory. Motivated by this, a numerical scheme based on hybrid dynamics combining velocity jumps and Langevin diffusion, numerically more efficient than their classical Langevin counterparts, has been introduced for computational chemistry in [42]. The present work is devoted to the numerical analysis of this scheme. Our main results are, first, the exponential ergodicity of the continuous-time velocity jump Langevin process, second, a Talay-Tubaro expansion of the invariant measure of the numerical scheme on the torus, showing in particular that the scheme is of weak order 2 in the step-size and, third, a bound on the quadratic risk of the corresponding practical MCMC estimator (possibly with Richardson extrapolation). With respect to previous works on the Langevin diffusion, new difficulties arise from the jump operator, which is non-local.</description>

      <title>Achieving $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/N)$ Optimality Gap in Restless Bandits through Gaussian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-horizon Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) problem with $N$ homogeneous arms. Prior work has shown that when an RMAB satisfies a non-degeneracy condition, Linear-Programming-based (LP-based) policies derived from the fluid approximation, which captures the mean dynamics of the system, achieve an exponentially small optimality gap. However, it is common for RMABs to be degenerate, in which case LP-based policies can result in a $\Theta(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap per arm. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic-Programming-based (SP-based) policy that, under a uniqueness assumption, achieves an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/N)$ optimality gap for degenerate RMABs. Our approach is based on the construction of a Gaussian stochastic system that captures not only the mean but also the variance of the RMAB dynamics, resulting in a more accurate approximation than the fluid approximation. We then solve a stochastic program for this system to obtain our policy. This is the first result to establish an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/N)$ optimality gap for degenerate RMABs.</description>

      <title>On theoretical guarantees and a blessing of dimensionality for nonconvex sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing guarantees for algorithms sampling from nonlogconcave measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ are generally inexplicit or unscalable. Even for the class of measures with logdensities that have bounded Hessians and are strongly concave outside a Euclidean ball of radius $R$, no available theory is comprehensively satisfactory with respect to both $R$ and $d$. In this paper, it is shown that complete polynomial complexity can in fact be achieved if $R\leq c\sqrt{d}$, whilst an exponential number of point evaluations is generally necessary for any algorithm as soon as $R\geq C\sqrt{d}$ for constants $C&gt;c&gt;0$. Importance sampling with a tail-matching proposal achieves the former, owing to a blessing of dimensionality. On the other hand, if strong concavity outside a ball is replaced by a distant dissipativity condition, then sampling guarantees must generally scale exponentially with $d$ in all parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of the multivariate Spearman's footrule: a further discussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new estimators of the multivariate rank correlation coefficient Spearman's footrule which are based on two general estimators for Average Orthant Dependence measures. We compare the new proposals with a previous estimator existing in the literature and show that the three estimators are asymptotically equivalent, but, in small samples, one of the proposed estimators outperforms the others. We also analyse Pitman efficiency of these indices to test for multivariate independence as compared to multivariate versions of Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>
