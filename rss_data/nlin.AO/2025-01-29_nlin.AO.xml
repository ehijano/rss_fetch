      <title>Quantifying system-environment synergistic information by effective information decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is the most crucial characteristic of a system with life activity? Currently, many theories have attempted to explain the most essential difference between living systems and general systems, such as the self-organization theory and the free energy principle, but there is a lack of a reasonable indicator that can measure to what extent a system can be regarded as a system with life characteristics, especially the lack of attention to the dynamic characteristics of life systems. In this article, we propose a new indicator at the level of dynamic mechanisms to measure the ability of a system to flexibly respond to the environment. We proved that this indicator satisfies the axiom system of multivariate information decomposition in the partial information decomposition (PID) framework. Through further disassembly and analysis of this indicator, we found that it is determined by the degree of entanglement between system and environmental variables in the dynamics and the magnitude of noise. We conducted measurements on cellular automata (CA), random Boolean networks, and real gene regulatory networks (GRN), verified its relationship with the type of CA and the Langton parameter, and identified that the feedback loops have high abilities to flexibly respond to the environment on the GRN. We also combined machine learning technology to prove that this framework can be applied in the case of unknown dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Dynamical Theory of LLM Self-Adversariality: Modeling Severity Drift as a Critical Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic dynamical framework for understanding how large language models (LLMs) may self-amplify latent biases or toxicity through their own chain-of-thought reasoning. The model posits an instantaneous "severity" variable $x(t) \in [0,1]$ evolving under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a drift term $\mu(x)$ and diffusion $\sigma(x)$. Crucially, such a process can be consistently analyzed via the Fokker--Planck approach if each incremental step behaves nearly Markovian in severity space. The analysis investigates critical phenomena, showing that certain parameter regimes create phase transitions from subcritical (self-correcting) to supercritical (runaway severity). The paper derives stationary distributions, first-passage times to harmful thresholds, and scaling laws near critical points. Finally, it highlights implications for agents and extended LLM reasoning models: in principle, these equations might serve as a basis for formal verification of whether a model remains stable or propagates bias over repeated inferences.</description>

      <title>Self-modulated multimode silicon cavity optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode cavity optomechanics, where multiple mechanical degrees of freedom couple to optical cavity modes, provides a rich platform for exploring nonlinear dynamics and engineering complex interactions. In this work, we investigate the interplay between two mechanical modes with similar characteristics and a self-induced nonlinear modulation of intra-cavity power (self-pulsing) driven by free-carrier dispersion and thermo-optic effects in silicon. Notably, the self-pulsing dynamics adapts to the optomechanically induced perturbations from both mechanical modes, enabling simultaneous synchronous pumping and driving them into a stable state characterized by high-amplitude, self-sustained, and coherent oscillations. This result effectively overcomes the strong mode competition typically observed in modes with similar spatial distributions and frequency scales. Remarkably, this regime is achieved even when the mechanical frequencies do not satisfy a harmonic relation, leading to quasi-periodic or chaotic intra-cavity power dynamics, while the mechanical modes maintain coherent, high-amplitude oscillations. These results, supported by a numerical model that accurately predicts the dynamics of the system, open new pathways for the generation and control of multi-phonon coherent sources in chip-integrated silicon platforms.</description>

      <title>Geospatial distributions reflect rates of evolution of features of language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the speed of linguistic change is challenging due to the fact that the historical evolution of languages is sparsely documented. Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leaves a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit in learning period three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this paper, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we first show that almost all learned periods are unstable and each network has its characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). The latently acquired dynamics, which are unstable within the trained network, serve as a foundation for the diversity of characteristic attractors and may even lead to the emergence of attractors of all periods after learning. When the neural network interpolation is quadratic, a universal post-learning bifurcation scenario appears, which is consistent with a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map. In addition to universality, we explore specific properties of certain networks, including the singular behavior at the infinite scale of weights limit and the symmetry in learning period three.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional model for adaptive networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a large ensemble of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with heterogeneous input currents and adaptation variables. Our analysis reveals that for a specific class of adaptation, termed quadratic spike-frequency adaptation (QSFA), the high-dimensional system can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, which describes the dynamics of three mean-field variables: the population's firing rate, the mean membrane potential, and a mean adaptation variable. The resulting low-dimensional firing rate equations (FRE) uncover a key generic feature of heterogeneous networks with spike frequency adaptation: Both the center and the width of the distribution of the neurons' firing frequencies are reduced, and this largely promotes the emergence of collective synchronization in the network. Our findings are further supported by the bifurcation analysis of the FRE, which accurately captures the collective dynamics of the spiking neuron network, including phenomena such as collective oscillations, bursting, and macroscopic chaos.</description>
