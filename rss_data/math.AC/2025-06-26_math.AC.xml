      <title>Rees algebra and almost linearly presented ideals in three variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R=\k[x,y,z]$ and $I=(f_0,\dots,f_{n-1})$ be a height two perfect ideal which is almost linearly presented (that is, all but the last column have linear entries, but the last column has entries which are homogeneous of degree $2$). Further we suppose that after modulo an ideal generated by two variables, the presentation matrix has rank one. Also, the ideal $I$ satisfies $\Gs{{2}}$ but not $\Gs{3}$, then we obtain explicit formulas for the defining ideal of the Rees algebra $\rees(I)$ of $I$.</description>

      <title>On a minimal free resolution of the residue field over a local ring of codepth 3 of class T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be any local ring with residue field $k$, and $A$ the homology of the Koszul complex on a minimal set of generators of the maximal ideal of $R$. In this paper, we show that a minimal free resolution of $k$ over $R$ can be obtained from a graded minimal free resolution of $k$ over $A$. More precisely, this is done by the iterated mapping cone construction, introduced by the authors in a previous work, using specific choices of ingredients. As applications, using this general perspective, we exhibit a minimal free resolution of $k$ over a complete intersection ring of any codepth, and explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of $k$ over a local ring of codepth 3 of class $T$ in terms of Koszul blocks.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Cohomology of the Flag Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One hundred years ago, Hilbert gave a list of important open problems in mathematics. His 15th problem asked for the development of a rigorous calculus explaining Schubert's enumerative results for intersecting varieties defined by rank conditions on vector spaces. Today by way of many contributions in algebraic topology, geometry, and combinatorics, we consider this solved. Yet, deep questions remain about the subtleties of actually carrying out the process. In this chapter, we hope to summarize the rigorous development of what has become known as Schubert calculus, with an eye toward computation. We discuss Grassmannians and flag varieties and their cohomology rings, following Monk's constructive algebraic approach. We derive formulas for Schur and Schubert polynomials, which represent cohomology classes of Schubert varieties. We hint at the vast literature in this area and point to the other references in the Handbook for more information. Finally, we identify open problems that remain a challenge even with modern tools at our fingertips in hopes of inspiring further contributions in this fascinating field.
  This is intended as the first chapter of a book entitled "Handbook of Combinatorial Algebraic Geometry: Subvarieties of the Flag Variety", a compendium of topics in the area. The book is being edited by Erik Insko, Martha Precup, and Ed Richmond. In addition to this introductory chapter, others will cover more advanced topics such as Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties, generalized smooth Schubert varieties, Richardson varieties and positroid varieties, spherical and torus orbit closures, spanning line configurations, different types of Hessenberg varieties, and generalizations to Kac-Moody flag varieties, each written by experts in those areas. We hope you enjoy this chapter enough to seek out the others, and that you send us any comments or corrections you find as you read this article!</description>

      <title>Zero cycles, Mennicke symbols and $\mathrm{K}_1$-stability of certain real affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14384v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a reduced real affine algebra of (Krull) dimension $d \ge 2$ such that either $R$ has no real maximal ideals, or the intersection of all real maximal ideals in $R$ has height at least one. In this article, we prove the following: (1) the $d$-th Euler class group $\text{E}^d(R)$, defined by Bhatwadekar-R.~Sridharan, is canonically isomorphic to the Levine-Weibel Chow group of zero cycles $\text{CH}_0(\text{Spec}(R))$; (2) the universal Mennicke symbol $\text{MS}_{d+1}(R)$ is canonically isomorphic to the universal weak Mennicke symbol $\text{WMS}_{d+1}(R)$; and (3) additionally, if $R$ is a regular domain, then the Whitehead group $\mathrm{SK_1}(R)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\frac{\text{SL}_{d+1}(R)}{\text{E}_{d+1}(R)}$. As an application, we investigate some Eisenbud-Evans type theorems.</description>

      <title>Minimal generating sets of large powers of bivariate monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a monomial ideal $I$, it is known that for increasing $n$ the number of minimal generators $\mu(I^n)$ eventually follows a polynomial pattern. In general, little is known about the power at which this pattern emerges. Even less is known about the exact form of the minimal generators after this power. We show that for sufficiently large $s\in\mathbb{N}$, every higher power $I^{s+\ell}$ can be constructed from certain subideals of $I^s$. We further show that such an $s$ can be chosen to satisfy $s\le\mu(I)(d^2-1)+1$, where $d$ is a constant bounded above by the maximal $x$- or $y$-degree appearing in the set $\mathsf{G}(I)$ of minimal generators of $I$. This provides an explicit description of $\mathsf{G}(I^n)$ in terms of $\mathsf{G}(I^s)$, significantlyreducing computational complexity in determining high powers of bivariate monomial ideals. This further enables us to explicitly compute $\mu(I^n)$ for all $n\ge s$ in terms of a linear polynomial in $n$. We include runtime measurements for the attached implementation in SageMath.</description>
