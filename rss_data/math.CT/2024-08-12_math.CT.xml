      <title>Internal geometry and functors between sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locality is implemented in an arbitrary category using Grothendieck topologies. We explore how different Grothendieck topologies on one category can be related, and, more general, how functors between categories can preserve them. As applications of locality, we review geometric objects such as sheaves, groupoids, functors, bibundles, and anafunctors internal to an arbitrary Grothendieck site. We give definitions such that all these objects are invariant under equivalences of Grothendieck topologies and certain functors between sites. As examples of sites, we look at categories of smooth manifolds, diffeological spaces, topological spaces, and sheaves, and we study properties of various functors between those.</description>

      <title>$(\infty,n)$-Limits II: Comparison across models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the notion of $(\infty,n)$-limit defined using the enriched approach and the one defined using the internal approach coincide. We also give explicit constructions of various double $(\infty,n-1)$-categories implementing various join constructions, slice constructions and cone constructions, and study their properties. We further prove that key examples of $(\infty,n)$-categories are (co)complete.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Framework for Quantifying Emergent Effects in Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent effect is crucial to the understanding of the properties of complex systems that do not appear in their basic units, but there has been a lack of theories to measure and understand its mechanisms. In this paper, we established a framework based on homological algebra that encodes emergence as the mathematical structure of cohomologies and then applied it to network models to develop a computational measure of emergence. This framework ties the emergence of a system to its network topology and local structures, paving the way to predict and understand the cause of emergent effects. We show in our numerical experiment that our measure of emergence correlates with the existing information-theoretic measure of emergence.</description>

      <title>Singularity categories of rational double points in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the singularity categories of rational double points and the simply-laced Dynkin graphs in arbitrary characteristic. This correspondence is well-known in characteristic zero since the rational double points are quotient singularities in characteristic zero whereas not necessarily in positive characteristic. Considering some rational double points are not taut in characteristic two, three or five, we can see there exist two rational double points which are not analytically isomorphic but whose singularity categories are triangulated equivalent. As an application, we construct a counter-example in positive characteristic of a theorem of Hua and Keller: the dg singularity category of a hypersurface singularity determines its Tyurina algebra.</description>
