      <title>Difference-in-Discontinuities: Estimation, Inference and Validity Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the econometric theory behind the newly developed difference-in-discontinuities design (DiDC). Despite its increasing use in applied research, there are currently limited studies of its properties. The method combines elements of regression discontinuity (RDD) and difference-in-differences (DiD) designs, allowing researchers to eliminate the effects of potential confounders at the discontinuity. We formalize the difference-in-discontinuity theory by stating the identification assumptions and proposing a nonparametric estimator, deriving its asymptotic properties and examining the scenarios in which the DiDC has desirable bias properties when compared to the standard RDD. We also provide comprehensive tests for one of the identification assumption of the DiDC. Monte Carlo simulation studies show that the estimators have good performance in finite samples. Finally, we revisit Grembi et al. (2016), that studies the effects of relaxing fiscal rules on public finance outcomes in Italian municipalities. The results show that the proposed estimator exhibits substantially smaller confidence intervals for the estimated effects.</description>

      <title>Transmission Channel Analysis in Dynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for the analysis of transmission channels in a large class of dynamic models. To this end, we formulate our approach both using graph theory and potential outcomes, which we show to be equivalent. Our method, labelled Transmission Channel Analysis (TCA), allows for the decomposition of total effects captured by impulse response functions into the effects flowing along transmission channels, thereby providing a quantitative assessment of the strength of various transmission channels. We establish that this requires no additional identification assumptions beyond the identification of the structural shock whose effects the researcher wants to decompose. Additionally, we prove that impulse response functions are sufficient statistics for the computation of transmission effects. We also demonstrate the empirical relevance of TCA for policy evaluation by decomposing the effects of various monetary policy shock measures into instantaneous implementation effects and effects that likely relate to forward guidance.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Potential Outcomes for Mixtures of Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern data analysis frequently relies on the use of large datasets, often constructed as amalgamations of diverse populations or data-sources. Heterogeneity across these smaller datasets constitutes two major challenges for causal inference: (1) the source of each sample can introduce latent confounding between treatment and effect, and (2) diverse populations may respond differently to the same treatment, giving rise to heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). The issues of latent confounding and HTEs have been studied separately but not in conjunction. In particular, previous works only report the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) among similar individuals (with respect to the measured covariates). CATEs cannot resolve mixtures of potential treatment effects driven by latent heterogeneity, which we call mixtures of treatment effects (MTEs). Inspired by method of moment approaches to mixture models, we propose "synthetic potential outcomes" (SPOs). Our new approach deconfounds heterogeneity while also guaranteeing the identifiability of MTEs. This technique bypasses full recovery of a mixture, which significantly simplifies its requirements for identifiability. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPOs on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Generalized Neyman Allocation: Local Asymptotic Minimax Optimal Best Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates a local asymptotic minimax optimal strategy for fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI). We propose the Adaptive Generalized Neyman Allocation (AGNA) strategy and show that its worst-case upper bound of the probability of misidentifying the best arm aligns with the worst-case lower bound under the small-gap regime, where the gap between the expected outcomes of the best and suboptimal arms is small. Our strategy corresponds to a generalization of the Neyman allocation for two-armed bandits (Neyman, 1934; Kaufmann et al., 2016) and a refinement of existing strategies such as the ones proposed by Glynn &amp; Juneja (2004) and Shin et al. (2018). Compared to Komiyama et al. (2022), which proposes a minimax rate-optimal strategy, our proposed strategy has a tighter upper bound that exactly matches the lower bound, including the constant terms, by restricting the class of distributions to the class of small-gap distributions. Our result contributes to the longstanding open issue about the existence of asymptotically optimal strategies in fixed-budget BAI, by presenting the local asymptotic minimax optimal strategy.</description>
