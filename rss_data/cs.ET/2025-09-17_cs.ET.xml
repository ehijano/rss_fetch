      <title>An Analysis of Resource Allocation and User Association Strategies in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-Air-Ground-Integrated Networks (SAGIN) enable seamless data connectivity for applications such as smart transport, healthcare, smart cities, and disaster response through the coordinated use of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, base stations mounted with uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV), and terrestrial infrastructure. This paper provides a detailed analysis of resource management frameworks, reviews the literature, and evaluates key methods such as alternating optimization (AO), damped iterative water filling (DIWF), and genetic algorithms (GA) for resource allocation. MATLAB simulation results benchmark these algorithms across 10,000 trials, demonstrating robust, fair, and low-latency resource allocation. In addition, this paper also analyzes strategies for user association with terrestrial and aerial base stations during emergencies and network overloads. The main contributions include a comparative assessment of resource allocation strategies in SAGIN and an in-depth analysis of user association policies for emergency scenarios. The study provides guidance for designing resilient and efficient next-generation networks. Potential future research directions include investigating satellite handover and multi-domain orchestration for SAGIN deployments.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Agentic IoEV: AI Agents for Explainable Cyberthreat Mitigation and State Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) envisions a tightly coupled ecosystem of electric vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure, and grid services, yet it remains vulnerable to cyberattacks, unreliable battery-state predictions, and opaque decision processes that erode trust and performance. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI) framework tailored for IoEV, where specialized agents collaborate to deliver autonomous threat mitigation, robust analytics, and interpretable decision support. Specifically, we design an AAI architecture comprising dedicated agents for cyber-threat detection and response at charging stations, real-time State of Charge (SoC) estimation, and State of Health (SoH) anomaly detection, all coordinated through a shared, explainable reasoning layer; develop interpretable threat-mitigation mechanisms that proactively identify and neutralize attacks on both physical charging points and learning components; propose resilient SoC and SoH models that leverage continuous and adversarial-aware learning to produce accurate, uncertainty-aware forecasts with human-readable explanations; and implement a three-agent pipeline, where each agent uses LLM-driven reasoning and dynamic tool invocation to interpret intent, contextualize tasks, and execute formal optimizations for user-centric assistance. Finally, we validate our framework through comprehensive experiments across diverse IoEV scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in security and prediction accuracy. All datasets, models, and code will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>Neural 3D Object Reconstruction with Small-Scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous, high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100 grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger platforms.</description>

      <title>DoubleAgents: Exploring Mechanisms of Building Trust with Proactive AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic workflows promise efficiency, but adoption hinges on whether people actually trust systems that act on their behalf. We present DoubleAgents, an agentic planning tool that embeds transparency and control through user intervention, value-reflecting policies, rich state visualizations, and uncertainty flagging for human coordination tasks. A built-in respondent simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse, refine policies, and calibrate their reliance before live use. We evaluate DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n=10), two deployments (n=2), and a technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to delegate but grew more reliant as they experienced transparency, control, and adaptive learning during simulated cases. Deployment results demonstrate DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that the effort required scaled appropriately with task complexity and contextual data. We contribute trust-by-design patterns and mechanisms for proactive AI -- consistency, controllability, and explainability -- along with simulation as a safe path to build and calibrate trust over time.</description>

      <title>Low-Altitude UAV Tracking via Sensing-Assisted Predictive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted predictive beamforming, as one of the enabling technologies for emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm, shows significant promise for enhancing various future unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. However, current works predominately emphasized on spectral efficiency enhancement, while the impact of such beamforming techniques on the communication reliability was largely unexplored and challenging to characterize. To fill this research gap and tackle this issue, this paper investigates outage capacity maximization for UAV tracking under the sensing-assisted predictive beamforming scheme. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV tracking scheme is proposed leveraging extended Kalman filtering (EKF), where the predicted UAV trajectory, sensing duration ratio, and target constant received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are jointly optimized to maximize the outage capacity at each time slot. To address the implicit nature of the objective function, closed-form approximations of the outage probabilities (OPs) at both prediction and measurement stages of each time slot are proposed based on second-order Taylor expansions, providing an efficient and full characterization of outage capacity. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is proposed based on a combination of bisection search and successive convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convex optimization problem with guaranteed convergence. To further reduce computational complexity, a second efficient algorithm is developed based on alternating optimization (AO). Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived OP approximations, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the significant outage capacity enhancement over various benchmarks, while also indicating a trade-off between decreasing path loss and enjoying wide beam coverage for outage capacity maximization.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Model-Free Prediction of Thermal States of Robot Joint Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, deep neural networks made up of multiple hidden Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Feedforward layers are trained to predict the thermal behavior of the joint motors of robot manipulators. A model-free and scalable approach is adopted. It accommodates complexity and uncertainty challenges stemming from the derivation, identification, and validation of a large number of parameters of an approximation model that is hardly available. To this end, sensed joint torques are collected and processed to foresee the thermal behavior of joint motors. Promising prediction results of the machine learning based capture of the temperature dynamics of joint motors of a redundant robot with seven joints are presented.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative and Discriminative Digital Twin endowed with Variational Autoencoder for Unsupervised Predictive Thermal Condition Monitoring of Physical Robots in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry 4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown, when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.</description>

      <title>Is Circuit Depth Accurate for Comparing Quantum Circuit Runtimes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantum circuit depth is commonly used to approximate circuit runtimes, it overlooks a prevailing trait of current hardware implementation: different gates have different execution times. Recognizing the potential for discrepancies, we investigate depth's accuracy for comparing runtimes between compiled versions of the same circuit. In particular, we assess the accuracy of traditional and multi-qubit depth for (1) predicting relative differences in runtime and (2) identifying compiled circuit version(s) with the shortest runtime. Finding that circuit depth is not accurate for either task, we introduce a new metric, gate-aware depth, that weights gates' contributions to runtime using an architecture's average gate execution times. Using average gate times allows gate-aware depth to capture variations by gate type without requiring exact knowledge of all gate times, increasing accuracy while maintaining portability across devices of the same architecture. Compared to traditional and multi-qubit depth, gate-aware depth reduces the average relative error of predictions in task (1) by 68 and 18 times and increases the average number of correct identifications in task (2) by 20 and 43 percentage points, respectively. Finally, we provide gate-aware depth weight configurations for current IBM Eagle and Heron architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous In-situ Soil Sampling and Mapping in Large-Scale Agricultural Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional soil sampling and analysis methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and limited in spatial resolution, making them unsuitable for large-scale precision agriculture. To address these limitations, we present a robotic solution for real-time sampling, analysis and mapping of key soil properties. Our system consists of two main sub-systems: a Sample Acquisition System (SAS) for precise, automated in-field soil sampling; and a Sample Analysis Lab (Lab) for real-time soil property analysis. The system's performance was validated through extensive field trials at a large-scale Australian farm. Experimental results show that the SAS can consistently acquire soil samples with a mass of 50g at a depth of 200mm, while the Lab can process each sample within 10 minutes to accurately measure pH and macronutrients. These results demonstrate the potential of the system to provide farmers with timely, data-driven insights for more efficient and sustainable soil management and fertilizer application.</description>

      <title>AI Governance in Higher Education: A course design exploring regulatory, ethical and practical considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems permeate critical sectors, the need for professionals who can address ethical, legal and governance challenges has become urgent. Current AI ethics education remains fragmented, often siloed by discipline and disconnected from practice. This paper synthesizes literature and regulatory developments to propose a modular, interdisciplinary curriculum that integrates technical foundations with ethics, law and policy. We highlight recurring operational failures in AI - bias, misspecified objectives, generalization errors, misuse and governance breakdowns - and link them to pedagogical strategies for teaching AI governance. Drawing on perspectives from the EU, China and international frameworks, we outline a semester plan that emphasizes integrated ethics, stakeholder engagement and experiential learning. The curriculum aims to prepare students to diagnose risks, navigate regulation and engage diverse stakeholders, fostering adaptive and ethically grounded professionals for responsible AI governance.</description>
