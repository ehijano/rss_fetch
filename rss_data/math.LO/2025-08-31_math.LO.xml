      <title>Abstraction Principles and the Size of Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fregean ontology can be naturally interpreted within set theory with urelements, where objects correspond to sets and urelements, and concepts to classes. Consequently, Fregean abstraction principles can be formulated as set-theoretic principles. We investigate how the size of reality-i.e., the number of urelements-interacts with these principles. We show that Basic Law V implies that for some well-ordered cardinal $\kappa$, there is no set of urelements of size $\kappa$. Building on recent work by Hamkins \cite{hamkins2022fregean}, we show that, under certain additional axioms, Basic Law V holds if and only if the urelements form a set. We construct models of urelement set theory in which the Reflection Principle holds while Hume's Principle fails for sets. Additionally, assuming the consistency of an inaccessible cardinal, we produce a model of Kelley-Morse class theory with urelements that has a global well-ordering but lacks a definable map satisfying Hume's Principle for classes.</description>

      <title>Internal Categoricity and the Generic Multiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: John Steel's theory, MV, of the generic multiverse provides a foundation for mathematics that aims to neutralize the effects of incompleteness brought on by forcing arguments. Jouko V\"a\"an\"anen's development of internal categoricity arguments provides opportunities to argue that the subject matter of some theory is, in some sense, determined. This paper investigates whether MV is internally categorical.</description>

      <title>Unital Specker $\ell$-groups and boolean multispaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a topological generalization of the notion of multiset, a boolean multispace is a boolean space $X$ with a continuous function $u\colon X\to \mathbb Z_{&gt;0}$, where $\mathbb Z_{&gt;0}=\{1,2,\dots\}$ has the discrete topology. In this paper the category of boolean multispaces and continuous multiplicity-decreasing morphisms with respect to the divisibility order is shown to be dually equivalent to the category of unital Specker $\ell$-groups and unital $\ell$-homomorphisms. This result extends Stone duality, because unital Specker $\ell$-groups whose distinguished unit is singular are equivalent to boolean algebras. Boolean multispaces, in turn, are categorically equivalent to the Priestley duals of the MV-algebras corresponding to unital Specker $\ell$-groups via the $\Gamma$ functor. Via duality, we show that the category of unital Specker $\ell$-groups has finite colimits and finite products, but lacks some countable copowers and equalizers.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-saturation for stable graphs and Littlestone classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any Littlestone class, or stable graph, has finite sets which function as ``virtual elements'': these can be seen from the learning side as representing hypotheses which are expressible as weighted majority opinions of hypotheses in the class, and from the model-theoretic side as an approximate finitary version of realizing types. We introduce and study the epsilon-saturation of a Littlestone class, or stable graph, which is essentially the closure of the class under inductively adding all such virtual elements. We characterize this closure and prove that under reasonable choices of parameters, it remains Littlestone (or stable), though not always of the same Littlestone dimension. This highlights some surprising phenomena having to do with regimes of epsilon and the relation between Littlestone/stability and VC dimension.</description>

      <title>Generation of Grothendieck topologies, provability and operations on subtoposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After reviewing the multiple roles of toposes - as generalized topological spaces, as universal invariants, as categorical analogues of the set-theoretic universe, and as semantic environments for first-order theories - we recall the notion of subtopos and its dual expression: both in terms of Grothendieck topologies and in terms of first-order logic. We emphasize the significance of this duality, which enables the translation of provability problems in first-order logic into problems concerning the generation of Grothendieck topologies. We also introduce the natural geometric operations, both inner and outer, on subtoposes.
  Building on these foundations, we present a new formulation of the duality between Grothendieck topologies and subtoposes, as well as the duality between topologies and closedness properties of subpresheaves. This presentation relies on general categorical principles and aims to clarify the structural relationships involved.
  We then provide two general formulas for the Grothendieck topology generated by an arbitrary family of sieves or covering families of morphisms. In addition, we refine the constructive procedures that translate logical provability into topology generation, highlighting their role in bridging logic and geometry within the topos-theoretic framework.
  Finally, we study the inner geometric operations on subtoposes: union, intersection, and difference, along with the outer adjoint operations of pushforward and pullback along topos morphisms. We prove that pullback operations preserve not only arbitrary intersections but also finite unions of subtoposes, and that pullbacks along locally connected morphisms even preserve arbitrary unions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of filter (equivalently: ideal) Schauder basis of a Banach space. We do so by providing bunch of new examples of such bases that are not the standard ones, especially within classical Banach spaces ($\ell_p$, $c_0$, James' space). Those examples lead to distinguishing and characterizing filters (equivalently: ideals) in terms of Schauder bases. We investigate the relationship between possibly basic sequences and filters (equivalently: ideals) on the set of natural numbers.</description>

      <title>The $\pi$-property of a Banach space along a filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the analyticity of the class of separable Banach spaces possessing the $\pi$-property, defined in terms of convergence along a filter. Our results establish that this class is $\Sigma^1_3$ whenever the underlying filter is analytic (as a subset of the Cantor set $\Delta$). Furthermore, we demonstrate that if the filter is countably generated, the class of such spaces is $\Sigma^1_2$ with respect to any admissible Polish topology on the family of closed subspaces of $C(\Delta)$.</description>

      <title>Sites and Grothendieck toposes: an introduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topos theory occupies a singular place in contemporary mathematics: born from Grothendieck's algebraic geometry, it has emerged as a unifying language for geometry, topology, algebra, and logic. This book offers a progressive introduction that moves from familiar ground - groups and their actions, topological spaces, categories, and sheaves - to Grothendieck topologies and sites, then to the axiomatic and categorical foundations of toposes (via Giraud's theorem), to their geometry (morphisms, points, subtoposes, localizations) and finally to their deep ties with geometric logic through classifying toposes. Aimed at readers with a basic familiarity with algebra, general topology, and category theory, the book emphasizes reversible viewpoints - external/internal, local/global, syntactic/semantic - guided by canonical examples, key theorems, and universal constructions. It equips the reader with a workable language in which spaces become categories of sheaves and theories become places classified by toposes. Future chapters will present "toposes as bridges" and relative toposes.</description>

      <title>The Universal Theory of Locally Universal Tracial von Neumann Algebras is not Computable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on Lin's breakthrough MIP$^{co}$ = coRE and an encoding of non-local games as universal sentences in the language of tracial von Neumann algebras, we show that locally universal tracial von Neumann algebras have undecidable universal theories. This implies that no such algebra admits a computable presentation. Our results also provide, for the first time, explicit examples of separable II$_1$ factors without computable presentations, and in fact yield a broad family of them, including McDuff factors, factors without property Gamma, and property (T) factors. We also obtain analogous results for locally universal semifinite von Neumann algebras and tracial C*-algebras. The latter provides strong evidence for a negative solution to the Kirchberg Embedding Problem. We discuss how these are obstructions to approximation properties in the class of tracial and semifinite von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy for derivations and automorphisms of C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on previous work of Kadison--Ringrose, Elliott, Akemann--Pedersen, and this author, we prove a dichotomy for the relation of outer equivalence of derivations and unitary equivalence of derivable automorphisms for a separable C*-algebra $A$: either such relations are trivial, or the relation $E_{0}^{\mathbb{N}}$ of tail equivalence of countably many binary sequences is reducible to them. When $A$ is furthermore \emph{unital}, this implies that $A$ has no outer derivation if and only if the group $\mathrm{Inn}\left( A\right) $ of inner automorphisms is $\boldsymbol{\Sigma }_{2}^{0}$ in $\mathrm{Aut}\left( A\right) $, if and only if it is $\boldsymbol{\Sigma }_{3}^{0}$ in $\mathrm{Aut}\left( A\right) $. Furthermore, one has that the space of inner derivations is norm-closed if and only if \textrm{Inn}$\left(A\right) $ is norm-closed, if and only if $\mathrm{Inn}\left( A\right) $ is $\boldsymbol{\Pi }_{3}^{0}$ in $\mathrm{\mathrm{Aut}}\left( A\right) $. This provides a complexity-theoretic characterization of C*-algebras with only inner derivations, which as a by-product rules out $D(\boldsymbol{\Pi }_{2}^{0})$ as a possible complexity class for $\mathrm{Inn}\left( A\right) $ in $\mathrm{\mathrm{Aut}}\left( A\right) $ for a separable unital C*-algebra $A$.</description>

      <title>Model theoretic events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do we randomly sample an infinite sequence from a first order structure? What properties might hold on almost all random sequences? Which kinds of probabilistic processes can be meaningfully applied and studied in the model theory context? This paper takes these questions seriously and advances a plausible framework to engage with probabilistic phenomena.
  The central object of this paper is a probability space. The underlying set of our space is a standard model theoretic object, i.e. the space of types in countably many variables over a monster model. Our probability measure is the iterated Morley product of a fixed Borel-definable Keisler measure. Choosing a point randomly in this space with respect to our distribution yields a "random generic type" in countably many variables. We are interested in which events hold for almost all random generic types. We consider two different flavors of model theoretic events: (1) When is the induced structure on almost all random generic types isomorphic to a fixed structure? (2) For a fixed formula which is unstable, IP, sOP, etc., what is the probability that a random generic type witnesses this dividing line?
  For (1), we show that if our measure satisfies a particular extension axiom, then there exists a structure $N$ such that the induced structure on almost all random generic types is isomorphic to $N$. The proof echos a celebrated result of Glebskii et al. and Fagin concerning the existence of almost sure theories. We also provide examples where no such model exists. For (2), we show that if our initial distribution is fim, then almost no random generic types witness instability, IP, or sOP. In the local NIP context, we use results from combinatorics to prove that for any Borel-definable measure, the "average value of witnessing k-instability" across all permutations converges to 0. Some examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Large cardinals, structural reflection, and the HOD Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce exacting cardinals and a strengthening of these, ultraexacting cardinals. These are natural large cardinals defined equivalently as weak forms of rank-Berkeley cardinals, strong forms of J\'onsson cardinals, or in terms of principles of structural reflection. However, they challenge commonly held intuition on strong axioms of infinity. We prove that ultraexacting cardinals are consistent with Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) relative to the existence of an I0 embedding. However, the existence of an ultraexacting cardinal below a measurable cardinal implies the consistency of ZFC with a proper class of I0 embeddings, thus challenging the linear-incremental picture of the large cardinal hierarchy. We show that the existence of an exacting cardinal implies that V is not equal to HOD (G\"odel's universe of Hereditarily Ordinal Definable sets), showing that these cardinals surpass the current hierarchy of large cardinals consistent with ZFC. We prove that the consistency of ZFC with an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal refutes Woodin's HOD Conjecture and Ultimate-L Conjecture. Finally, we show that the consistency of ZF with certain large cardinals beyond choice implies the consistency of ZFC with the existence of an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular (or cyclic) proofs have received increasing attention in recent years, and have been proposed as an alternative setting for studying (co)inductive reasoning. In particular, now several type systems based on circular reasoning have been proposed. However, little is known about the complexity theoretic aspects of circular proofs, which exhibit sophisticated loop structures atypical of more common `recursion schemes'. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between circular proofs and implicit computational complexity (ICC). Namely we introduce a circular proof system based on Bellantoni and Cook's famous safe-normal function algebra, and we identify proof theoretical constraints, inspired by ICC, to characterise the polynomial-time and elementary computable functions. Along the way we introduce new recursion theoretic implicit characterisations of these classes that may be of interest in their own right.</description>
