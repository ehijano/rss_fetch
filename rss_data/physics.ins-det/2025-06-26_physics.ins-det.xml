      <title>Versatile luminescence macroscope with dynamic illumination for photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminescence imaging is invaluable for studying biological and material systems, particularly when advanced protocols that exploit temporal dynamics are employed. However, implementing such protocols often requires custom instrumentation, either modified commercial systems or fully bespoke setups, which poses a barrier for researchers without expertise in optics, electronics, or software. To address this, we present a versatile macroscopic fluorescence imaging system capable of supporting a wide range of protocols, and provide detailed build instructions along with open-source software to enable replication with minimal prior experience. We demonstrate its broad utility through applications to plants, reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Detectors and Electronics for the CBM experiment at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is a next-generation heavy-ion experiment under development at the future FAIR facility in Darmstadt, Germany. It is designed to explore the QCD phase diagram at high net-baryon densities with unprecedented precision. Operating in fixed-target mode with a continuous beam of up to 11 AGeV for heavy ions and 26 GeV for protons, CBM will investigate rare probes such as multi-strange hyperons, hypernuclei, and dileptons, aiming to identify signatures of a first-order phase transition and the QCD critical point.
  To achieve these goals, CBM employs a free-streaming, self-triggered readout architecture and a suite of radiation-hard, low-mass detectors capable of operating at interaction rates up to 10 MHz. The experimental set-up consists of several detector subsystems optimised for precise vertexing, tracking, particle identification, and event reconstruction. These subsystems have undergone extensive prototyping and validation campaigns, with many components already tested and integrated into existing experiments such as STAR/RHIC, HADES/SIS18, and E16/J-PARC. These efforts culminated in the realisation of the mCBM test set-up at the SIS18 accelerator, where key systems were successfully commissioned under realistic beam conditions.
  This contribution provides a concise overview of the current status of detector development, series production, and validation efforts through both simulations and measurements.</description>

      <title>First High-Throughput Evaluation of Dark Matter Detector Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first high-throughput search and evaluation of materials that can serve as excellent low-mass dark matter detectors. Using properties of close to one thousand materials from the Materials Project database, we project the sensitivity in dark matter parameter space for experiments constructed from each material, including both absorption and scattering processes between dark matter and electrons. Using the anisotropic materials in the dataset, we further compute the level of daily modulation in interaction rates and the resulting directional sensitivities, highlighting materials with prospects to detect the dark matter wind. Our methods provide the basic tools for the data-driven design of dark matter detectors, and our findings lay the groundwork for the next generation of highly optimized direct searches for dark matter as light as the keV scale.</description>

      <title>Novel coincidence detection technique for precision measurement of neutron-capture-induced nuclear recoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Usually, detailed information about particle motions, energies, and interactions in the crystal lattice cannot be directly measured. Neutron capture (n,{\gamma}) can produce detectable, precise-energy nuclear recoils for detector calibration and solid-state physics studies. This paper proposes a first-of-its-kind experiment to measure the twin products of neutron capture - the postcapture deexcitation gamma and postcapture nuclear recoil. Simulations show that with a 1 mCi californium neutron source, a positive measurement with existing detector technologies is possible in 26.1 gram-days of exposure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ICARUS liquid argon TPC detector is taking data on the Booster (BNB) and Main Injector (NuMI) Neutrino beam lines at Fermilab with a trigger system based on the scintillation light produced by charged particles in coincidence with the proton beam extraction from the accelerators. The architecture and the deployment of the trigger system in the first two runs for physics are presented, as well as the triggered event rates. The event recognition efficiency has been evaluated as a function of the deposited energy and the position of cosmic muons stopping inside the detector.</description>

      <title>Integrated optomechanical ultrasonic sensors with nano-Pascal-level sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasonic sensors are widely used for object detection and localization in underwater and biological settings. The operational range and spatial resolution are inherently limited by sensor sensitivity, in which conventional piezoelectric transducers have been overwhelmed by advanced photonic sensors. Here, we demonstrate an optomechanical ultrasonic sensor integrated into a photonic platform, which comprises a suspended SiO2 membrane embedded with a high-Q Si3N4 microring resonator. By exploiting simultaneous optical and mechanical resonances, the sensor achieves a record low noise-equivalent pressure (NEP) of 218 nPa/Hz^1/2 at 289 kHz in air and 9.6 nPa/Hz^1/2 at 52 kHz in water. We demonstrate its versatility through photoacoustic gas spectroscopy in air and underwater ultrasound imaging, achieving a minimum detectable C2H2 concentration of 2.9 ppm (integration time 1 s) and an imaging resolution of 1.89 mm, respectively. Our work represents a significant advancement in compact CMOS-compatible ultrasound sensing, unlocking new possibilities in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, industrial testing, and underwater communications.</description>

      <title>Computed tomography of propagating microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Propagating photons serve as essential links for distributing quantum information and entanglement across distant nodes. Knowledge of their Wigner functions not only enables their deployment as active information carriers but also provides error diagnostics when photons passively leak from a quantum processing unit. While well-established for standing waves, characterizing propagating microwave photons requires post-processing of room-temperature signals with excessive amplification noise. Here, we demonstrate cryogenic and amplification-free Wigner function tomography of propagating microwave photons using a superconductor-normal metal-superconductor bolometer based on the resistive heating effect of absorbed radiation. By introducing two-field interference in power detection, the bolometer acts as a sensitive and broadband quadrature detector that samples the input field at selected angles at millikelvin with no added noise. Adapting the principles of computed tomography (CT) in medical imaging, we implement Wigner function CT by combining quadrature histograms across different projection angles and demonstrate it for Gaussian states at the single-photon level with different symmetries. Compressed sensing and neural networks further reduce the projections to three without compromising the reconstruction quality. These results address the long-standing challenge of characterizing propagating microwave photons in a superconducting quantum network and establish a new avenue for real-time quantum error diagnostics and correction.</description>

      <title>In-flight calibration of the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), as a pathfinder of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, is the first lobster-eye focusing X-ray telescope with a considerably large field-of-view (FoV) ever flown. During the two and half years of operations, a series of calibration observations were performed, to fully characterize its performance and calibrate the instrumental properties. In this paper, we present the results of the in-flight calibration campaign of LEIA, focusing on the properties of the PSF, source positional accuracy, effective area, energy response and the instrumental background. The calibration sources used are the Crab nebula, Sco X-1 and Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Specifically, it is found that the spatial resolution remains almost unchanged compared to the pre-launch values, ranging from 3.6'-9.3' with a median of 5.9'. The post-calibration source positional accuracy is found to be ~2' (at the 90% C.L.). The Crab spectra can be well reproduced by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit parameters in large agreement with the literature values, indicating that the in-orbit effective area is overall consistent with the model predictions and ground measurements. The effective area exhibits a systematic of $\lesssim10\%$ (at the 68% C.L.), and a mild deterioration of ~15% at the lower energy end after one year of operation. The Cas A spectral analysis shows that the energy scale and spectral resolution of the detectors are generally consistent with ground values. The instrumental background is found to be largely consistent among the four detectors, with strong modulations by the geomagnetic activity and the spectrum qualitatively consistent with our previous simulations. These instrumental performances well meet the design requirements. This work paves the way for the in-orbit calibration of the EP-WXT.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of displacements with stabilized GKP states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how recent protocols developed for the stabilization of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states can be used for the estimation of two-quadrature displacement sensing, with sensitivities approaching the multivariate quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Thanks to the stabilization, this sensor is backaction evading and can function continuously without reset, making it well suited for the detection of itinerant signals. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations showing that the protocol can unconditionally surpass the Gaussian limit of displacement sensing with prior information, even in the presence of realistic noise. Our work shows how reservoir engineering in bosonic systems can be leveraged for quantum metrology, with potential applications in force sensing, waveform estimation and quantum channel learning.</description>

      <title>SuperSONIC: Cloud-Native Infrastructure for ML Inferencing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing computational demand from growing data rates and complex machine learning (ML) algorithms in large-scale scientific experiments has driven the adoption of the Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC) approach. SONIC accelerates ML inference by offloading it to local or remote coprocessors to optimize resource utilization. Leveraging its portability to different types of coprocessors, SONIC enhances data processing and model deployment efficiency for cutting-edge research in high energy physics (HEP) and multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA). We developed the SuperSONIC project, a scalable server infrastructure for SONIC, enabling the deployment of computationally intensive tasks to Kubernetes clusters equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs). Using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, SuperSONIC decouples client workflows from server infrastructure, standardizing communication, optimizing throughput, load balancing, and monitoring. SuperSONIC has been successfully deployed for the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube), and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and tested on Kubernetes clusters at Purdue University, the National Research Platform (NRP), and the University of Chicago. SuperSONIC addresses the challenges of the Cloud-native era by providing a reusable, configurable framework that enhances the efficiency of accelerator-based inference deployment across diverse scientific domains and industries.</description>

      <title>SALSA: a new versatile readout chip for MPGD detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SALSA chip is a future readout ASIC foreseen for the MPGD detectors, developed in the framework of the EIC collider project, to equip the MPGD trackers of the EPIC experiment. It is designed to be versatile, to be adapted to other usages of MPGD detectors like TPC or photon detectors. It integrates a frontend block and an ADC for each of the 64 channels, associated to a configurable DSP processor meant to correct data and reduce the raw data flux to limit the output bandwidth. It will be compatible with the continuous readout foreseen for the EPIC DAQ, but will also work in a triggered environment. Several prototypes are already produced in order to qualify the different blocks of the chip, in particular the frontend, the ADC and the clock generation. The next 32-channel prototype is currently under development and is planed to be produced in 2025. The final prototype will be produced and tested from 2026 for a production of the SALSA chip at the horizon of 2027.

      <title>Heliometric stereo: a new frontier in surface profilometry</title>

Abstract: Accurate and reliable measurements of three-dimensional surface structures are important for a broad range of technological and research applications, including materials science, nanotechnology, and biomedical research. Scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) uses low-energy (64 meV) neutral helium atoms as the imaging probe particles, providing a highly sensitive and delicate approach to measuring surface topography. To date, topographic SHeM measurements have been largely qualitative, but with the advent of the heliometric stereo method - a technique that combines multiple images to create a 3D representation of a surface - quantitative maps of surface topography may now be acquired with SHeM. Here, we present and discuss two different implementations of heliometric stereo on two separate instruments, a single detector SHeM and a multiple-detector SHeM. Both implementations show good accuracy (5% and 10% respectively) for recovering the shape of a surface. Additionally, we discuss where heliometric stereo is most applicable, identify contrast features that can limit its accuracy, and discuss how to mitigate these limitations with careful design and sample choices that be readily implemented on current instruments.</description>

      <title>Medusa 84 SiH -- A novel high Selectivity Electron Beam Resist for Diamond Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Detection of subsurface structures with a vehicle-based atom gravity gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision mobile gravity gradiometers are very useful in geodesy and geophysics. Atom gravity gradiometers (AGGs) could be among the most accurate mobile gravity gradiometers but are currently constrained by the trade-off between portability and sensitivity. Here, we present a high-sensitivity mobile AGG featuring an ultra-compact sensor head with a volume of only 94 L. In the laboratory, it achieves a sensitivity of 77 E/$\sqrt{Hz}$ (1 E=1$\times10^{-9}$/s$^2$) and a long-term stability of better than 0.5 E. We integrated the instrument in a minivan, enabling efficient mobile field surveys with excellent maneuverability in confined spaces. Using this vehicular system, we surveyed the gravitational field over a set of subsurface structures within a small wooded area, successfully resolving their structural signatures with a signal-to-noise ratio of 57 and quantifying the water depth in a reservoir with an accuracy of $\pm$0.23 m. Compared with previous observations using a CG-5 gravimeter, the superior spatial resolution inherent in gradiometry is clearly demonstrated. This work paves the way for bring AGGs to practical field applications.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pretrain the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>
