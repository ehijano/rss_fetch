      <title>Impact of (a)Synchronism on ECA: Towards a New Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effect of (a)synchronism on the dynamics of elementary cellular automata. Within the framework of our study, we choose five distinct update schemes, selected from the family of periodic update modes: parallel, sequential, block-sequential, block-parallel, and local clocks. Our main measure of complexity is the maximum period of the limit cycles in the dynamics of each rule. In this context, we present a classification of the ECA rule landscape. We classified most elementary rules into three distinct regimes: constant, linear, and superpolynomial. Surprisingly, while some rules exhibit more complex behavior under a broader class of update schemes, others show similar behavior across all the considered update schemes. Although we are able to derive upper and lower bounds for the maximum period of the limit cycles in most cases, the analysis of some rules remains open. To complement the study of the 88 elementary rules, we introduce a numerical simulation framework based on two main measurements: the energy and density of the configurations. In this context, we observe that some rules exhibit significant variability depending on the update scheme, while others remain stable, confirming what was observed as a result of the classification obtained in the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Reducing Sensor Requirements by Relaxing the Network Metric Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source localization in graphs involves identifying the origin of a phenomenon or event, such as an epidemic outbreak or a misinformation source, by leveraging structural graph properties. One key concept in this context is the metric dimension, which quantifies the minimum number of strategically placed sensors needed to uniquely identify all vertices based on their distances. While powerful, the traditional metric dimension imposes a stringent requirement that every vertex must be uniquely identified, often necessitating a large number of sensors. In this work, we relax the metric dimension and allow vertices at a graph distance less than k to share identical distance profiles relative to the sensors. This relaxation reduces the number of sensors needed while maintaining sufficient resolution for practical applications like source localization and network monitoring. We provide two main theoretical contributions: an analysis of the k-relaxed metric dimension in deterministic trees, revealing the interplay between structural properties and sensor placement, and an extension to random trees generated by branching processes, offering insights into stochastic settings. We also conduct numerical experiments across a variety of graph types, including random trees, random geometric graphs, and real-world networks. The results show that the relaxed metric dimension is significantly smaller than the traditional metric dimension. Furthermore, the number of vertices indistinguishable from any given target vertex always remains small. Finally, we propose and evaluate a two-step localization strategy that balances the trade-off between resolution and the number of sensors required. This strategy identifies an optimal relaxation level that minimizes the total number of sensors across both steps, providing a practical and efficient approach to source localization.</description>

      <title>Prefix-bounded matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By unifying various earlier extensions of alternating sign matrices (ASMs), we introduce the notion of prefix-bounded matrices (PBMs). It is shown that the convex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special (called laminar) g-polymatroids. This implies (in a more general form) that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight and by Striker for describing the polytope of alternating sign matrices is TDI, confirming a recent conjecture of Edmonds. By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a characterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting upper and lower bound requirements on their entries.
  Furthermore, we point out that the constraint matrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs (in particular, ASMs) is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network flow techniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural results on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually box-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs has (a sharpened form of) the integer Carath\'eodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property. This latter feature makes it possible to confirm (in an extended form) an elegant conjecture of Brualdi and Dahl on the decomposability of a so-called $k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Firefighting on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a pursuit-evasion game that describes the process of extinguishing a fire burning on the nodes of an undirected graph. We denote the minimum number of firefighters required by $\text{ffn}(G)$ and provide a characterization for the graphs with $\text{ffn}(G)=1$ and $\text{ffn}(G)=2$ as well as almost sharp bounds for complete binary trees. We show that deciding whether $\text{ffn}(G) \leq m$ for given $G$ and $m$ is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that shortest strategies can have superpolynomial length, leaving open whether the problem is in NP. Based on some plausible conjectures, we also prove that this decision problem is neither NP-hard for graphs with bounded treewidth nor for constant $m$.</description>

      <title>Separability Properties of Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal C$ is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored graphs from $\mathcal C$ using a fixed first-order interpretation. We prove that monadically dependent classes can be exactly characterized by the following property, which we call flip-separability: for every $r\in \mathbb{N}$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$ equipped with a weight function on vertices, one can apply a bounded (in terms of $\mathcal{C},r,\varepsilon$) number of flips (complementations of the adjacency relation on a subset of vertices) to $G$ so that in the resulting graph, every radius-$r$ ball contains at most an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the total weight. On the way to this result, we introduce a robust toolbox for working with various notions of local separations in monadically dependent classes.</description>

      <title>Trees with proper thinness 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proper thinness of a graph is an invariant that generalizes the concept of a proper interval graph. Every graph has a numerical value of proper thinness and the graphs with proper thinness~1 are exactly the proper interval graphs. A graph is proper $k$-thin if its vertices can be ordered in such a way that there is a partition of the vertices into $k$ classes satisfying that for each triple of vertices $r &lt; s &lt; t$, such that there is an edge between $r$ and $t$, it is true that if $r$ and $s$ belong to the same class, then there is an edge between $s$ and $t$, and if $s$ and $t$ belong to the same class, then there is an edge between $r$ and $s$. The proper thinness is the smallest value of $k$ such that the graph is proper $k$-thin. In this work we focus on the calculation of proper thinness for trees. We characterize trees of proper thinness~2, both structurally and by their minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. The characterizations obtained lead to a polynomial-time recognition algorithm. We furthermore show why the structural results obtained for trees of proper thinness~2 cannot be straightforwardly generalized to trees of proper thinness~3.</description>

      <title>Exploring subgraph complementation to bounded degree graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph modification problems are computational tasks where the goal is to change an input graph $G$ using operations from a fixed set, in order to make the resulting graph satisfy a target property, which usually entails membership to a desired graph class $\mathcal{C}$. Some well-known examples of operations include vertex-deletion, edge-deletion, edge-addition and edge-contraction. In this paper we address an operation known as subgraph complement. Given a graph $G$ and a subset $S$ of its vertices, the subgraph complement $G \oplus S$ is the graph resulting of complementing the edge set of the subgraph induced by $S$ in $G$. We say that a graph $H$ is a subgraph complement of $G$ if there is an $S$ such that $H$ is isomorphic to $G \oplus S$. For a graph class $\mathcal{C}$, subgraph complementation to $\mathcal{C}$ is the problem of deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ has a subgraph complement in $\mathcal{C}$. This problem has been studied and its complexity has been settled for many classes $\mathcal{C}$ such as $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs, for various families $\mathcal{H}$, and for classes of bounded degeneracy. In this work, we focus on classes graphs of minimum/maximum degree upper/lower bounded by some value $k$. In particular, we answer an open question of Antony et al. [Information Processing Letters 188, 106530 (2025)], by showing that subgraph complementation to $\mathcal{C}$ is NP-complete when $\mathcal{C}$ is the class of graphs of minimum degree at least $k$, if $k$ is part of the input. We also show that subgraph complementation to $k$-regular parameterized by $k$ is fixed-parameter tractable.</description>

      <title>Permanent of bipartite graphs in terms of determinants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the permanent of a $(0,1)$-matrix is a well-known $\#P$-complete problem. In this paper, we present an expression for the permanent of a bipartite graph in terms of the determinant of the graph and its subgraphs, obtained by successively removing rows and columns corresponding to vertices involved in vertex-disjoint $4k$-cycles. Our formula establishes a general relationship between the permanent and the determinant for any bipartite graph. Since computing the permanent of a biadjacency matrix is equivalent to counting the number of its perfect matchings, this approach also provides a more efficient method for counting perfect matchings in certain types of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>An $\mathcal{O}(n)$ Space Construction of Superpermutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A superpermutation is a sequence that contains every permutation of $n$ distinct symbols as a contiguous substring. For instance, a valid example for three symbols is a sequence that contains all six permutations. This paper introduces a new algorithm that constructs such sequences more efficiently than existing recursive and graph-theoretic methods. Unlike traditional techniques that suffer from scalability and factorial memory demands, the proposed approach builds superpermutations directly and compactly. This improves memory usage, enabling the construction of larger sequences previously considered impractical.</description>

      <title>Simple Compact Monotone Tree Drawings</title>

      <description>arXiv:1708.09653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A monotone drawing of a graph G is a straight-line drawing of G such that every pair of vertices is connected by a path that is monotone with respect to some direction.
  Trees, as a special class of graphs, have been the focus of several papers and, recently, He and He~\cite{mt:4} showed how to produce a monotone drawing of an arbitrary $n$-vertex tree that is contained in a $12n \times 12n$ grid.
  All monotone tree drawing algorithms that have appeared in the literature consider rooted ordered trees and they draw them so that (i) the root of the tree is drawn at the origin of the drawing, (ii) the drawing is confined in the first quadrant, and (iii) the ordering/embedding of the tree is respected. In this paper, we provide a simple algorithm that has the exact same characteristics and, given an $n$-vertex rooted tree $T$, it outputs a monotone drawing of $T$ that fits on a $n \times n$ grid.
  For unrooted ordered trees, we present an algorithms that produces monotone drawings that respect the ordering and fit in an $(n+1) \times (\frac{n}{2} +1)$ grid, while, for unrooted non-ordered trees we produce monotone drawings of good aspect ratio which fit on a grid of size at most $\left\lfloor \frac{3}{4} \left(n+2\right)\right\rfloor \times \left\lfloor \frac{3}{4} \left(n+2\right)\right\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Staying Fresh: Efficient Algorithms for Timely Social Information Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In location-based social networks (LBSNs), users sense urban point-of-interest (PoI) information in the vicinity and share such information with friends in online social networks. Given users' limited social connections and severe lags in disseminating fresh PoI to all, major LBSNs aim to enhance users' social PoI sharing by selecting $k$ out of $m$ users as hotspots and broadcasting their fresh PoI information to the entire user community. This motivates us to study a new combinatorial optimization problem that involves the interplay between an urban sensing network and an online social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and also renders existing approximation solutions not viable. Through analyzing the interplay effects between the two networks, we successfully transform the involved PoI-sharing process across two networks to matrix computations for deriving a closed-form objective to hold desirable properties (e.g., submodularity and monotonicity). This finding enables us to develop a polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees a ($1-\frac{m-2}{m}(\frac{k-1}{k})^k$) approximation of the optimum. Furthermore, we allow each selected user to move around and sense more PoI information to share and propose an augmentation-adaptive algorithm with decent performance guarantees. Finally, our theoretical results are corroborated by our simulation findings using both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Diameter on H-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intensively studied Diameter problem is to find the diameter of a given connected graph. We investigate, for the first time in a structured manner, the complexity of Diameter for H-free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain a fixed graph H as an induced subgraph. We first show that if H is not a linear forest with small components, then Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH. For some small linear forests, we do show linear-time algorithms for solving Diameter. For other linear forests H, we make progress towards linear-time algorithms by considering specific diameter values. If H is a linear forest, the maximum value of the diameter of any graph in a connected H-free graph class is some constant dmax dependent only on H. We give linear-time algorithms for deciding if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax, for several linear forests H. In contrast, for one such linear forest H, Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH. Moreover, we even show that, for several other linear forests H, one cannot decide in subquadratic time if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax under SETH.</description>

      <title>IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithm achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we show that this does not extend to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), while it can be extended to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

We say that a series is commutative if the value in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input. The commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite presentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it is commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has not been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.
  We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that constitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's varieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series, introduced by Sch\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective (pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.
  In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of formal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata, shuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these models recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their commutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it remarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such disparate computation models.
  Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of formal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power series for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential equations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks to this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive sequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are effective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.</description>
