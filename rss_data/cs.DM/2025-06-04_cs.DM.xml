      <title>Boolean-network simplification and rule fitting to unravel chemotherapy resistance in non-small cell lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks are powerful frameworks for capturing the logic of gene-regulatory circuits, yet their combinatorial explosion hampers exhaustive analyses. Here, we present a systematic reduction of a 31-node Boolean model that describes cisplatin- and pemetrexed-resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer to a compact 9-node core that exactly reproduces the original attractor landscape. The streamlined network shrinks the state space by four orders of magnitude, enabling rapid exploration of critical control points, rules fitting and candidate therapeutic targets. Extensive synchronous and asynchronous simulations confirm that the three clinically relevant steady states and their basins of attraction are conserved and reflect resistance frequencies close to those reported in clinical studies. The reduced model provides an accessible scaffold for future mechanistic and drug-discovery studies.</description>

      <title>Bounded Discrete Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2010 Banderier and Nicodeme consider the height of bounded discrete bridges and conclude to a limiting Rayleigh distribution. This result is correct although their proof is partly erroneous. They make asymptotic simplifications based upon dominance properties of the roots of the kernel of the walk within a disk centered at the origin, but these dominance properties apply only upon a positive real segment. However the very good agreement of simulations with their asymptotic expansion of the probability distribution in case of {\L}ukasiewicz bridges let us think that their proof could be corrected. This is the scope of the present article which provides
  a proof using the dominance property only in its domain of validity. We also consider the case of periodic walks, a topic not considered in Banderier-Nicodeme2010. We limit ourselves to walks whose characteristic polynomial decomposes over $\bC$ without repeated factors.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00967v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

      <title>The clique chromatic number of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The clique chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors in a vertex coloring so that no maximal clique is monochromatic. In this paper, we determine the order of magnitude of the clique chromatic number of the random graph G_{n,p} for most edge-probabilities p in the range n^{-2/5} \ll p \ll 1. This resolves open problems and questions of Lichev, Mitsche and Warnke as well as Alon and Krievelevich.
  One major proof difficulty stems from high-degree vertices, which prevent maximal cliques in their neighborhoods: we deal with these vertices by an intricate union bound argument, that combines the probabilistic method with new degree counting arguments in order to enable Janson's inequality. This way we determine the asymptotics of the clique chromatic number of G_{n,p} in some ranges, and discover a surprising new phenomenon that contradicts earlier predictions for edge-probabilities p close to n^{-2/5}.</description>

      <title>Maximal Non-Kochen-Specker Sets and a Lower Bound on the Size of Kochen-Specker Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of determining bounds for the minimal number of vectors in a three-dimensional Kochen-Specker (KS) set has captivated the quantum foundations community for decades. This paper establishes a weak lower bound of 10 vectors, which does not surpass the current best-known bound of 24 vectors. By exploring the complementary concept of large non-KS sets and employing a probability argument independent of the graph structure of KS sets, we introduce a novel technique that could be applied in the future to derive tighter bounds. Additionally, we highlight an intriguing connection to a generalisation of the moving sofa problem in navigating a right-angled hallway on the surface of a two-dimensional sphere.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for the Network Scale-Up Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemiologists and social scientists have used the Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM) for over thirty years to estimate the size of a hidden sub-population within a social network. This method involves querying a subset of network nodes about the number of their neighbours belonging to the hidden sub-population. In general, NSUM assumes that the social network topology and the hidden sub-population distribution are well-behaved; hence, the NSUM estimate is close to the actual value. However, bounds on NSUM estimation errors have not been analytically proven. This paper provides analytical bounds on the error incurred by the two most popular NSUM estimators. These bounds assume that the queried nodes accurately provide their degree and the number of neighbors belonging to the hidden population. Our key findings are twofold. First, we show that when an adversary designs the network and places the hidden sub-population, then the estimate can be a factor of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ off from the real value (in a network with $n$ nodes). Second, we also prove error bounds when the underlying network is randomly generated, showing that a small constant factor can be achieved with high probability using samples of logarithmic size $O(\log{n})$. We present improved analytical bounds for Erdos-Renyi and Scale-Free networks. Our theoretical analysis is supported by an extensive set of numerical experiments designed to determine the effect of the sample size on the accuracy of the estimates in both synthetic and real networks.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Firefighting on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a pursuit-evasion game that describes the process of extinguishing a fire burning on the nodes of an undirected graph. We denote the minimum number of firefighters required by $\text{ffn}(G)$ and provide a characterization for the graphs with $\text{ffn}(G)=1$ and $\text{ffn}(G)=2$ as well as almost sharp bounds for complete binary trees. We show that deciding whether $\text{ffn}(G) \leq m$ for given $G$ and $m$ is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that shortest strategies can have superpolynomial length, leaving open whether the problem is in NP. Based on some plausible conjectures, we also prove that this decision problem is neither NP-hard for graphs with bounded treewidth nor for constant $m$.</description>

      <title>The only Class 0 Flower snark is the smallest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A pebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number is the smallest $t$ so that from any initial configuration of $t$ pebbles it is possible, after a sequence of pebbling moves, to place a pebble on any given target vertex. Graphs whose pebbling number is equal to the number of vertices are called Class~$0$ and provide a challenging set of graphs that resist being characterized. In this note, we answer a question recently proposed by the pioneering study on the pebbling number of snark graphs: we prove that the smallest Flower snark $J_3$ is Class~$0$, establishing that $J_3$ is in fact the only Class~$0$ Flower snark.</description>
