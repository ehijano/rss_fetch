      <title>Holographic Energy Correlators for Soft Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate energy correlators in a general holographic model of confinement, involving an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) warped extra dimension. Building on a recent computation in a minimal hard-wall model of confinement, we show that the shockwave method for efficiently computing energy correlators in AdS generalizes to an arbitrary warped geometry. This is possible because exact, linear shockwave solutions to the 5D field equations exist in any warped background. We apply our formalism to compute the two-point energy correlator for two simple models of confinement with interesting infrared spectra -- one with a gapped continuum spectrum and one with linear Regge trajectories. The results differ from the simple hard-wall model and from each other, demonstrating that the details of the confining dynamics affect the shape of the energy correlator observables.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution. Homogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense neutrino gases can exhibit collective flavor instabilities, triggering large flavor conversions that are driven primarily by neutrino-neutrino refraction. One broadly distinguishes between fast instabilities that exist in the limit of vanishing neutrino masses, and slow ones, that require neutrino mass splittings. In a related series of papers, we have shown that fast instabilities result from the resonant growth of flavor waves, in the same way as turbulent electric fields in an unstable plasma. Here we extend this framework to slow instabilities, focusing on the simplest case of an infinitely homogeneous medium with axisymmetric neutrino distribution. The relevant length and time scales are defined by three parameters: the vacuum oscillation frequency $\omega_E=\delta m^2/2E$, the scale of neutrino-neutrino refraction energy $\mu=\sqrt{2}G_F(n_\nu+n_{\overline\nu})$, and the ratio between lepton and particle number $\epsilon=(n_\nu-n_{\overline\nu})/(n_\nu+n_{\overline\nu})$. We distinguish between two very different regimes: (i) For $\omega_E\ll \mu \epsilon^2$, instabilities occur at small spatial scales of order $(\mu\epsilon)^{-1}$ with a time scale of order $\epsilon \omega_E^{-1}$. This novel branch of slow instability arises from resonant interactions with neutrinos moving along the axis of symmetry. (ii) For $\mu \epsilon^2\ll \omega_E\ll \mu$, the instability is strongly non-resonant, with typical time and length scales of order $1/\sqrt{\omega_E \mu}$. Unstable modes interact with all neutrino directions at once, recovering the characteristic scaling of the traditional studies of slow instabilities. In the inner regions of supernovae and neutron-star mergers, the first regime may be more likely to appear, meaning that slow instabilities in this region may have an entirely different character than usually envisaged.</description>

      <title>Neutrino portals to MeV WIMPs with s-channel mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale neutrino detectors currently under construction will have the unique ability to probe the annihilation of low-mass thermal-relic dark matter to neutrinos. This represents an essential test of the thermal freezeout paradigm. This raises the question: what viable UV-complete models are there in which dark matter annihilates dominantly to neutrinos? We discuss models that fulfill this criteria, and are invariant under the Standard Model gauge group, for both scalar and fermionic dark matter. Specifically, we construct new models in which annihilation via the $s$-channel exchange of a scalar or pseudoscalar mediator achieves the correct relic density. In these models, dark matter is stabilised by an exact or a softly-broken lepton-number symmetry. The parameter space of such models will be probed, almost entirely, by the combination of JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>The production and decay of $X_0(2900)$ state with different interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of $X_0(2900)$ in $B^+\rightarrow D^+D^-K^+$ decay process indicates the existence of open flavor tetraquark states. We study the production and decay of $X_0(2900)$ state with final state interaction mechanism, where we calculate the strong vertices such as $g_{\bar{D}KX_0}$, $g_{\bar{D}^\ast K^\ast X_0}$, $g_{D_s^{\ast}\bar{D}K}$ and $g_{D_{s1}\bar{D} K^\ast}$ in the framework of QCD sum rules method. We find that for the interpretation of the $\bar{D}^\ast K^\ast$ molecule of $X_0(2900)$, the branching fraction of the production process and the decay width are consistent with the experimental results, indicating that the observed $X_0(2900)$ could be interpreted as the $\bar{D}^\ast K^\ast$ molecule. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a compact tetraquark interpretation within the uncertainty. Further experimental and theoretical efforts should be made to fully understand the nature of the $X_0(2900)$ state.</description>

      <title>Testing the gauged $\mathrm{U(1)}_{B-L}$ model for loop induced neutrino mass with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new viable benchmark scenario under the current experimental data for the model which can explain tiny mass of active neutrinos and dark matter, as a summary of our results. Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos are given by the spontaneous breaking of the $\mathrm{U(1)}_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry above the electroweak scale, and tiny neutrino masses are radiatively induced by quantum effects of particles of the dark sector including dark matter candidates. We first show benchmark points which satisfy current experimental data, and then give comments on how this model can be tested at collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moment on coherent elastic solar neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of a transition magnetic moment between active and sterile neutrinos, sterile neutrinos could be produced by neutrino beams electromagnetically upscattering on nuclei. We study the active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moment through this upscattering in the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process induced by solar neutrinos. We place new limits on the transition magnetic moment-sterile neutrino mass plane using the latest data from the CDEX-10 experiment. We also provide projected sensitivities for future measurements. We observe that the projected sensitivities could cover some regions of the parameter space which were previously unexplored for the sterile neutrino mass up to $\sim$10 MeV.</description>

      <title>Simulation of dark scalar particle sensitivity in $\eta$ rare decay channels at HIAF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching dark portal particle is a hot topic in particle physics frontier. We present a simulation study of an experiment targeted for searching the scalar portal particle at Huizhou $\eta$ factory. The HIAF high-intensity proton beam and a high event-rate spectrometer are suggested for the experiment aimed for the discovery of new physics. Under the conservative estimation, $5.9\times 10^{11}$ $\eta$ events could be produced in one month running of the experiment. The hadronic production of $\eta$ meson ($p + ^7\text{Li} \rightarrow \eta X$) is simulated at beam energy of 1.8 GeV using GiBUU event generator. We tend to search for the light dark scalar particle in the rare decay channels $\eta \rightarrow S \pi^0 \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$ and $\eta \rightarrow S \pi^0 \rightarrow e^+ e^- \pi^0$. The detection efficiencies of the channels and the spectrometer resolutions are studied in the simulation. We also present the projected upper limits of the decay branching ratios of the dark scalar particle and the projected sensitivities to the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $\Lambda_c$ States and $(\bar{D}N)$ Molecules Production at EicC and EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore various $\Lambda_c$ states, including $\Lambda_c$, $\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\Lambda_c(2940)$, and the predicted $(\bar{D}N)$ hadronic molecular states, in photoproduction and electroproduction to estimate their yields at EicC and EIC. Assuming $\Lambda_c(2940)$ as either a hadronic molecular state or a three-quark state, our analysis demonstrates that its production rates are of the same order of magnitude, posing challenges in identifying its underlying structure. After considering the integral luminosity, the yields of $\Lambda_c$ excited states reach $10^6$ to $10^7$ at EicC and EIC. The $(\bar{D}N)$ molecular states with both isospin $I = 0$ and $I = 1$ are also studied, with yields reaching $10^5$, making them likely to be detectable at these facilities.</description>

      <title>Clustering logarithms up to six loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the leading clustering (abelian non-global) logarithms, which arise in the distribution of non-global QCD observables when final-state partons are clustered using the $k_t$ jet algorithm, up to six loops in perturbation theory. Our calculations are based on the recently introduced formula for the analytic structure of $k_t$ clustering [1]. These logarithms exhibit a pattern of exponentiation and are subsequently resummed into an exponential form. We compare this resummed result with all-orders numerical calculations. Additionally, we enhance the analytical distribution using techniques from the study of non-abelian non-global logarithms, particularly through the application of conformal transformations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlations in Neutrino and Neutral Meson Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the impact of ideas of open quantum systems and quantum information to various facets of neutrino and neutral meson oscillations. These oscillations are characterized by a number of quantum correlations, both spatial as well as temporal. For neutrinos, the correlations are shown to be simple functions of the product of neutrino survival and oscillation probabilities. The quantum correlations in the neutral mesons are seen to be non-trivially different from their stable counterparts.</description>

      <title>On electroweak metastability and Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses, the effective Higgs potential displays two minima, one at the electroweak scale and a deeper one at high energies. We review the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model, extending the Standard Model to include a non-minimal coupling to gravity; as recently shown, even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier between the minima.</description>

      <title>Scalar sector of Type 2 Seesaw model explorations with multi-lepton final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally motivated for the generation of (Majorana) neutrino masses, the Type 2 Seesaw Model has also a rich extended Higgs sector with, if accessible at the LHC, a distinctive phenomenology of neutral, charged and doubly-charged states. The goal of the work is to present an exhaustive phenomenological study of the most promising production and decay channels of pair or associated scalars, decaying directly or in cascades to Standard Model particles at the LHC. The study is complementary to the literature in that it highlights a previously unnoticed important sensitivity to a mixing angle. The ensuing uncertainty calls for a comprehensive experimental search strategy for the various processes. These processes can be studied within LHC energies reach, by comparing cutflow results for different final states. We carried out prospective search analyses with multi-lepton, jets and missing energy configurations, assuming an ATLAS-like detector at LHC and HL-LHC, for charged, doubly-charged, and for the first time neutral scalar productions. The work is a collaboration between ATLAS experimentalists and theoreticians in continuation of an endeavor that lead to previous published ATLAS analyses for the search of (doubly)charged Higgs bosons, aiming at proposals for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Roy-Steiner equation analysis of $\pi K$ scattering at unphysical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a rigorous analysis of the $\pi K$ scattering at an unphysical pion mass $391~$MeV using the Roy-Steiner equations, which satisfy unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry, for the first time. Stable solutions of the Roy-Steiner equations with different quantum numbers of isospin and angular momentum are obtained in the elastic energy region, by taking inputs from the $\pi K$ lattice data in the inelastic region, the lattice data from the crossed $\pi\pi \to K\bar{K}$ channels, the masses of $f_0(500)$ and $K^*$ at the same pion mass from previous study, and the Regge model. Predictions on the elastic $\pi K$ scattering phase shifts and the $K_0^*(700)$ pole content are made. Contrary to the virtual pole scenario obtained using the $K$-matrix method in the literature, we find that lightest strange scalar meson $K_0^*(700)$ remains a broad resonance at $M_\pi=391~$MeV. The cross-channel dynamics is found to play a crucial role in deriving the proper pole position.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data behavior of the pion-photon transition form factor (TFF) is discussed using a nonlinear mathematical model with two parameters. We show for the Belle data that the inherent inhibition of this model inevitably yields asymptotically to the saturation of the transition form factor in agreement with perturbative QCD. We find that the half-saturated TFF and the asymptotic limit of this model are interrelated and use this property in conjunction with the $1\sigma$ $(B,C)$ confidence ellipse to improve the quality of the fit of the Belle data. We show that the observed asymptotic saturation of the model is analogous to a mechanical system driven by a feedback-loop mechanism. The study of another parametrization without inhibition reveals that in this case asymptotic stability is not possible so that the uninhibited TFF continues to grow. In order to compare the key features of these two fit models, a conformity protocol in terms of QCD-based criteria is proposed.</description>

      <title>Self-interactions of ultralight spinless dark matter to the rescue?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous observations on astrophysical and cosmological scales can be interpreted to mean that, in addition to the familiar kind of matter well described by the standard model of elementary particle physics, there exists Dark Matter (DM). The fundamental properties of the elementary particles which make up the DM e.g. particle mass, spin, couplings etc are currently being observationally constrained. In particular, if DM particles have spin zero, there exist recent constraints which suggest a lower limit on its mass which is often a couple of orders of magnitude larger than $10^{-22}$ eV. In this talk, we will (a) argue that these limits are based on the assumption that the self coupling of the spinless DM particles is negligible, and, (b) show how some of these lower limits will get modified in the presence of incredibly feeble self interactions.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Metastability from Axion-Higgs Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organised criticality, realised through cosmological dynamics in the early universe, is an alternative paradigm for addressing the electroweak hierarchy problem. In this scenario, an unnaturally light Higgs boson is the result of dynamics driving the electroweak vacuum towards a near-critical metastable point where the Higgs mass is bounded from above by the vacuum instability scale. To lower the vacuum instability scale close to the weak scale, previous realisations of this mechanism introduced new vector-like fermions coupled to the Higgs. Here we show that an Axion-Like Particle (ALP) coupling to the Higgs is an alternative possibility for achieving criticality with another well-motivated and naturally light candidate for new physics, thus leading to an entirely different set of testable phenomenological signatures. Our Axion-Higgs criticality model predicts an ALP in the MeV to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV range. The entire natural region of parameter space can be thoroughly explored by a combination of future colliders, flavour experiments, and cosmological observatories.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the impact of neutrino mass hierarchies on neutrino mass constraints in light of recent DESI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI combined with cosmic microwave background data give the tightest constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to date. However, these analyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM) neutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper limits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino constraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. For Planck data alone, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies while showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior, confirming previous studies. For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find that assuming NH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$) or IH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$) loosens the Bayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.086\,\mathrm{eV}$). The frequentist analysis shows that the different neutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints can thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH. Overall, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding lower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.</description>

Abstract: In 1989 H.Karcher rewrote the theory of elliptic functions through an approach that is much more geometrical than analytical. Therewith he obtained an optimal control over the behaviour and image values of these functions, which allowed for their broad application in minimal surfaces. Our work is devoted to presenting the theory of elliptic functions according to Karcher's approach, as well as some of its applications in minimal surfaces. The original publication was a mini-course that can be downloaded at https://www.dm.ufscar.br/profs/lobos/IIEPG</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory and In-In Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictions of inflation are usually defined in terms of equal time in-in correlation functions in an accelerating cosmological background. These same observables exist for quantum field theory in other spacetimes, including flat space. In this paper, we will explore how the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) and effective field theory (EFT) apply to these observables in both flat and de Sitter space. Specifically, we show that matching the short- and long-distance calculations requires additional terms localized at the time of the measurement that are not captured by the effective action of the EFT. These additional terms only correct the local and semi-local terms in the EFT correlators. In flat space, we give an explicit demonstration by matching in-in correlators of light scalars interacting with a heavy field with the EFT result. We then show how these additional terms arise generically via exact RG. We also compare these explicit results in flat space with the corresponding theory in de Sitter and show that the local terms typically redshift away. Our results are closely related to momentum space entanglement that arises from tracing over short-wavelength modes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Nonstandard Neutrino Properties in Collapsing Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis Conditions in Outflows of White Dwarfs Collapsing to Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or merger-induced collapse (MIC) of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems is an interesting path to neutron star (NS) and magnetar formation, alternative to stellar core collapse and NS mergers. Such events could add a population of compact remnants in globular clusters, they are expected to produce yet unidentified electromagnetic transients including gamma-ray and radio bursts, and to act as sources of trans-iron elements, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. Here we present the first long-term (&gt;5 s post bounce) hydrodynamical simulations in axi-symmetry (2D), using energy- and velocity-dependent three-flavor neutrino transport based on a two-moment scheme. Our set of six models includes initial WD configurations for different masses, central densities, rotation rates, and angular momentum profiles. Our simulations demonstrate that rotation plays a crucial role for the proto-neutron star (PNS) evolution and ejecta properties. We find early neutron-rich ejecta and an increasingly proton-rich neutrino-driven wind at later times in a non-rotating model, in agreement with electron-capture supernova models. In contrast to that and different from previous results, our rotating models eject proton-rich material initially and increasingly more neutron-rich matter as time advances, because an extended accretion torus forms around the PNS and feeds neutrino-driven bipolar outflows for many seconds. AIC and MIC events are thus potential sites of r-process element production, which may imply constraints on their occurrence rates. Finally, our simulations neglect the effects of triaxial deformation and magnetic fields, serving as a temporary benchmark for more comprehensive future studies.</description>

      <title>From the Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with Internal Interactions to the $SO(10)$ GUT and the Particle Physics Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, the unification of the Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with the Internal Interactions is based on the observation that the tangent space of a curved space and the space itself do not have necessarily the same dimensions. Moreover, the construction is based on the fact that the gravitational theories can be formulated in a gauge-theoretical way. In the present work we study the various consecutive breakings through which these unified theories can ultimately result into the Standard Model. We estimate the scales of the breakings in each case using one-loop RGEs.</description>

      <title>Prospects for gamma-ray emission from magnetar regions in CTAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations have highlighted magnetars as significant sources of cosmic rays, particularly through their gamma-ray emissions. This study examines three magnetar regions - CXOU J171405.7-31031, Swift J1834-0846, and SGR 1806-20 - known for emitting detectable electromagnetic signals. We assess the detectability of these regions using the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) by conducting an ON/OFF spectral analysis and compare the expected results with existing observations. Our findings indicate that CTAO will detect gamma-ray emissions from these three magnetar regions with significantly reduced emission flux errors compared to current instruments. In special, the study shows that the CXOUJ1714-3810 and SwiftJ1834-0846 magnetar regions can be observed by the full southern and northern CTAO arrays in just five hours of observation, with mean significances above $10 \,\sigma$ and $30 \,\sigma$, respectively. This paper discusses the regions analyzed, presents key results, and concludes with insights drawn from the study.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities of net-baryon number based on the 3-dimensional Ising universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming the equilibrium of the QCD system, we have investigated the critical behavior of sixth-, eighth- and tenth-order susceptibilities of net-baryon number, through mapping the results in the three-dimensional Ising model to that of QCD. Both the leading critical contribution as well as sub-leading critical contribution from the Ising model are discussed. When considering only the leading critical contribution, the density plots for susceptibilities of the same order demonstrate a consistent general pattern independent on values of mapping parameters. As the critical point is approached from the crossover side, a negative dip followed by a positive peak is observed in the $\mu_B$ dependence of the three different orders of susceptibilities. When sub-leading critical contribution is taken into account, modifications become apparent in the density plots of the susceptibilities. The emergence of negative dips in the $\mu_B$ dependence of the susceptibilities is not an absolute phenomenon, while the positive peak structure is a more robust feature of the critical point.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering observables to GPDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) are multidimensonal structure functions that encode the information about the internal structure of hadrons. Using privileged channels such as Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) or Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS), it is possible to make direct measurements at points where the momentum fraction of the parton equals the respective scaling variable. Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) is a not yet measured and promising channel for GPD studies as it allows to perform more general measurements at independent momentum fraction and scaling variable values. GPDs are extracted from Compton Form Factors which arise naturally in experimental observables from different combinations of beam and target configurations. In the context of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and the Electron Ion Collider (EIC), we report the results of an exhaustive study of the DDVCS observables from polarized electron and positron beams directed to a polarized proton target. The study focuses on the sensitivity of the observables to the parton helicity conserving proton GPDs, particularly the consequences for GPDs measurements via DDVCS at CEBAF and EIC based on the VGG and GK19 model predictions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation in the Large Magellanic Cloud from multiple low-frequency radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of the Muon Neutrino Interaction Cross Section and Flux as a Function of Energy at the LHC with FASER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents the measurement of the energy-dependent neutrino-nucleon cross section in tungsten and the differential flux of muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of $13.6 \, {\rm TeV}$ and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $(65.6 \pm 1.4) \, \mathrm{fb^{-1}}$. Using the active electronic components of the FASER detector, $338.1 \pm 21.0$ charged current muon neutrino interaction events are identified, with backgrounds from other processes subtracted. We unfold the neutrino events into a fiducial volume corresponding to the sensitive regions of the FASER detector and interpret the results in two ways: We use the expected neutrino flux to measure the cross section, and we use the predicted cross section to measure the neutrino flux. Both results are presented in six bins of neutrino energy, achieving the first differential measurement in the TeV range. The observed distributions align with Standard Model predictions. Using this differential data, we extract the contributions of neutrinos from pion and kaon decays.</description>

      <title>Learning from galactic rotation curves: a neural network approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a galaxy, given its observed rotation curve, can one directly infer parameters of the dark matter density profile (such as dark matter particle mass $m$, scaling parameter $s$, core-to-envelope transition radius $r_t$ and NFW scale radius $r_s$), along with Baryonic parameters (such as the stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_*$)? In this work, using simulated rotation curves, we train neural networks, which can then be fed observed rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies from the SPARC catalog, to infer parameter values and their uncertainties. Since observed rotation curves have errors, we also explore the very important effect of noise in the training data on the inference. We employ two different methods to quantify uncertainties in the estimated parameters, and compare the results with those obtained using Bayesian methods. We find that the trained neural networks can extract parameters that describe observations well for the galaxies we studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09959v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate two sampling procedures assisted by machine learning models via regression and classification. The main objective is the use of a neural network to suggest points likely inside regions of interest, reducing the number of evaluations of time consuming calculations. We compare results from this approach with results from other sampling methods, namely Markov chain Monte Carlo and MultiNest, obtaining results that range from comparably similar to arguably better. In particular, we augment our classifier method with a boosting technique that rapidly increases the efficiency within a few iterations. We show results from our methods applied to a toy model and the type II 2HDM, using 3 and 7 free parameters, respectively. The code used for this paper and instructions are publicly available on the web.</description>

      <title>Search for Lepton Flavour Violating Signals at the Future Electron-Proton Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for lepton flavor violation (LFV) is a powerful probe to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model. We explored the possibility of searches for LFV $Z$ boson couplings to electron and muon pairs at the upcoming electron-proton colliders, namely the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) and the Future Circular lepton-hadron Collider (FCC-eh). We employed the study via a single muon plus an associated jet channel to search for the LFV signal. We used a multivariate technique to obtain an improved signal-background analysis. By using the condition on nonobservation of any significant deviation of the signal over the expected background, we provide an upper limit on the LFV $Z$ boson coupling and corresponding branching ratio. We find that an upper limit of $2.0\times 10^{-7}$ and $9.7 \times 10^{-8}$ can be set on BR($Z\to e \mu$) at 95% C.L. with one year run of LHeC and FCC-eh, respectively, if the LFV coupling is governed by vector or axial-vector coupling. For tensor or axial-tensor coupling, these limits can be improved to $6.2\times 10^{-8}$ and $2.2\times 10^{-8}$ for LHeC and FCC-eh machines, respectively. The projected numbers improve significantly over the existing limit of $2.62\times 10^{-7}$ set by ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Decay of CP-even Higgs $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ in Two Higgs Doublet Model: one-loop analytic results, ward identity checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first analytic expressions for loop-induced contributions for the decay of CP-even Higgs $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ with $h$ being Standard-Model-like Higgs boson within the framework of Two Higgs Doublet Model are presented in this paper. The one-loop form factors for the decay processes are written in terms of the scalar one-loop Passarino-Veltman functions following the notations of the packages~{\tt LoopTools} and {\tt Collier}. Subsequently, physical results for the decay processes can be generated numerically by using one of the above-mentioned packages. The analytic expressions shown in this paper are verified by several numerical checks, for examples, the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of one-loop amplitude. Furthermore, the amplitude satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identity due to on-shell photons in final states. The identity is also verified numerically in this work. In phenomenological studies, the differential decay rates as functions of the invariant mass of two photons in final states of $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ are first studied in parameter space of the Two Higgs Doublet Models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic mechanism of short range interactions between $u/d$ quarks remains an open and challenging problem. In order to reveal this quark dynamics, we perform a systematic analysis of $NN$, $D_{03}$, and $D_{30}$ systems in the (extended) chiral SU(3) constituent quark models. By comparing results calculated with different models and different parameter sets, the effects of one gluon exchange and vector meson exchange terms are carefully examined. The results indicate that the vector meson exchange interactions dominate the short range interactions between $u/d$ quarks, whereas the small residual one gluon exchange coupling strength is also allowed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emission of circularly polarized photons from a magnetized quark-gluon plasma with nonzero quark-number and chiral charge chemical potentials. These chemical potentials qualitatively influence the differential emission rates of circularly polarized photons. A nonzero net electric charge density, induced by quark-number chemical potentials, enhances the overall emission of one circular polarization over the other, while a nonzero chiral charge density introduces a spatial asymmetry in the emission with respect to reflection in the transverse plane. The signs of the electrical and chiral charge densities determine which circular polarization dominates overall and whether the emission preferentially aligns with or opposes the magnetic field. Based on these findings, we propose that polarized photon emission is a promising observable for characterizing the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the nuclear interferometer - a single-photon interferometry experiment based upon the thorium-229 nuclear clock transition - as a novel detector for ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that possible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or clouds of atoms have the potential to complement advanced very-long-baseline terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for ultra-light dark matter with scalar couplings to photons in the future. Nuclear interferometry may also offer an unparalleled window to new physics coupling to the QCD sector via quarks or gluons, with a discovery reach that could enhance existing and proposed experiments over a range of frequencies in the direction of well-motivated parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel realization of leptogenesis from the decays of sterile (right-handed) neutrinos (RHNs) produced from runaway bubble collisions at a first order phase transition. Such configurations can produce heavy RHNs with mass many orders of magnitude above the scale of symmetry breaking as well as the temperature of the plasma, thereby enabling high scale leptogenesis without the need for high reheat temperatures while also naturally suppressing washout effects. This mechanism also extends the window of viability to RHN masses $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the natural scale for type-I seesaw with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings, where standard thermal leptogenesis cannot produce the observed baryon asymmetry. The corresponding phase transitions are at scales $\gtrsim\!10^9$ GeV and produce gravitational wave signals that could be detected by future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has emerged as a novel tool for probing nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phenomena, such as color confinement in protons. While recent studies have demonstrated its significant capability in describing hadron production in deep inelastic scatterings, the QCD evolution of entanglement entropy remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the differential rapidity-dependent entanglement entropy within the proton and its connection to final-state hadrons, aiming to elucidate its QCD evolution. Our analysis reveals a strong agreement between the rapidity dependence of von Neumann entropy, obtained from QCD evolution equations, and the corresponding experimental data on hadron entropy. These findings provide compelling evidence for the emergence of a maximally entangled state, offering new insights into the nonperturbative structure of protons.</description>

      <title>Pion pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at next-to-leading order matched to Parton Shower</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pion pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at flavour factories plays a crucial role in the determination of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The recent CMD-3 measurement of the pion form factor via energy scan displays a significant difference with the previous experimental determinations. In order to contribute to an improved theoretical description and simulation of energy scan experiments, we present a calculation of the $e^+ e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^- (\gamma)$ hadronic channel at next-to-leading order matched to a Parton Shower algorithm in QED and sQED. According to the recent advances in the literature, particular attention is paid to the treatment of the pion composite structure in loop diagrams beyond the commonly used factorised sQED approach, as well as to the modelling of multiple photon radiation through the Parton Shower algorithm. In particular, we carry out a detailed discussion on the inclusion of the pion form factor in the virtual sQED corrections according to two independent methods, inspired by the generalised vector meson dominance model and the dispersive approach. We show phenomenological results for inclusive and differential observables which are relevant for precision energy scan measurements, focusing on the impact of the radiative corrections and the effect of the various approaches for the treatment of the pion form factor. Our calculation is implemented in an updated version of the Monte Carlo event generator BabaYaga@NLO, that can be used for fully exclusive simulations in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Correlations and fluctuations in a magnetized PNJL model with and without inverse magnetic catalysis effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and quadratic fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and temperature $T$ are investigated in a two-flavor Polyakov loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model at finite temperature and magnetic field. The inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect is introduced through the magnetic field dependent parameters $G(eB)$ or $T_0(eB)$, and we make comparison of the results in the cases with and without IMC effect. With nonvanishing magnetic field, the correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ increase with temperature, and then show the peak around the pseudocritical temperatures of chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions in the cases with and without the IMC effect. The correlation and fluctuations along the phase transition line under external magnetic field are characterized by the scaled correlation ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ}=\frac{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ and scaled fluctuations ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{B(Q,T)}=\frac{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ at the pseudocritical temperature $T_{pc}^c$ of chiral restoration phase transition. ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ},\ {\hat {\chi}}_2^{B}$, and ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{Q}$ increase with magnetic fields, and the inclusion of IMC effect leads to some enhancement in their values. However, ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{T}$ is altered by the IMC effect. Without IMC effect, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ slightly increases and then decreases with magnetic fields. Taking into account of the IMC effect by $G(eB)$, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ monotonically increases with magnetic fields, and by $T_0(eB)$, it is a nonmonotonic function of magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rare three body decay of a Higgs boson to a lepton-anti lepton pair and a photon has begun to attract attention, after the first evidence for the $H\to Z\gamma$ at CMS and ATLAS, which is a sub process of $H \to \ell^+ \ell^- \gamma$ . To investigate some important features of this process, we suggest that the polarized forward-backward and the photon polarization asymmetries could be useful to probe its important properties, such as the behavior of Yukawa coupling, resonance, and non-resonance contributions. Our analysis introduces a comprehensive framework to evaluate the aforementioned polarization-dependent observables. By analyzing the polarization effects of the final-state photon and lepton separately on forward-backward asymmetries, we demonstrate that loop-induced contributions play a significant role to investigate these asymmetries. Unlike the unpolarized case, where the interference effects of resonance and non-resonance effects are minimal, we show that polarization dependent observables offer a powerful tool to analyze these features of this decay mode. Furthermore, these observables can provide a handy tool for probing possible signatures of physics beyond the SM.</description>

Abstract: We consider asymptotically free gauge theories with gauge group $SU(N_c)$ and $N_f$ quarks with mass $m_q\ll \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ that undergo chiral symmetry breaking and confinement. We propose a bootstrap method to compute the S-matrix of the pseudo-Goldstone bosons (pions) that dominate the low energy physics. For the important case of $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, a numerical implementation of the method gives the phase shifts of the $S0$, $P1$ and $S2$ waves in good agreement with experimental results. The method incorporates gauge theory information ($N_c$, $N_f$, $m_q$, $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$) by using the form-factor bootstrap recently proposed by Karateev, Kuhn and Penedones together with a finite energy version of the SVZ sum rules. At low energy we impose constraints from chiral symmetry breaking. The only low energy numerical inputs are the pion mass $m_\pi$ and the quark and gluon condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Python tool to estimate the tail distribution of the number of dark matter halos beyond a mass threshold and in a given volume in a light-cone. The code is based on the extended Press-Schechter model and is computationally efficient, typically taking a few seconds on a personal laptop for a given set of cosmological parameters. The high efficiency of the code allows a quick estimation of the tension between cosmological models and the red candidate massive galaxies released by the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as scanning the theory space with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. As an example application, we use the tool to study the cosmological implication of the candidate galaxies presented in Labb\'e et al. (2023). The standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well consistent with the data if the star formation efficiency can reach $\sim 0.3$ at high redshift. For a low star formation efficiency $\epsilon \sim 0.1$, $\Lambda$CDM model is disfavored at $\sim 2\sigma$-$3\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bell inequalities for qubit-qudit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation. We apply our general results to address a number of issues. Namely, we obtain a bound on the degree of purity required in a system to exhibit nonlocality and study the statistics of nonlocality in random density matrices. Besides, we show the impossibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit in a Hilbert space of larger dimension. We also discuss how the results are generalized to POVM measurements. Finally, the general result is illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Phases of quartic scalar theories and PT symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator-type Hamiltonians, it is shown that there is a relation between the energy eigenvalues of parity symmetric and PT-symmetric phases for weak coupling. The possibility of such a relation was conjectured by Ai, Bender and Sarkar on examining the imaginary part of the ground state energy using path integrals. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the conjecture is true also for the real part of the ground state energy and of the excited state energies. However, the conjecture is false for strong coupling. The analogous relation for partition functions in zero spacetime dimensions is valid for many cases. However $O(N)$ symmetric multi-component scalar fields, with $N&gt;1$ and a quartic interaction, do not satisfy the conjecture for zero and one dimensional spacetime. The possibility that the conjecture is valid, for a single component field theory in higher dimensional spacetimes, is discussed in a simplified model.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations on small scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>
