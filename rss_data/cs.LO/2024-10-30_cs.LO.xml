      <title>Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and control, which allows programmers to control and reverse certain quantum circuits. In addition to these two operations, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form $g; f; g^{\dagger}$. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design. One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit $g ; f; g^{\dagger}$ directly from $g$, $f$, and $g^{\dagger}$, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only the circuit $f$ in the middle needs to be controlled; the circuits $g$ and $g^{\dagger}$ need not even be controllable.
  In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category $\mathbf{R}$ to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category $\mathbf{N}$ to interpret controllable circuits. The controllable category $\mathbf{N}$ encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation. Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023. We give an abstract categorical semantics for reversing, control and with-computed, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics. Lastly, we construct a concrete model using a generalization of biset enrichment from Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2022.</description>

      <title>Effective weak convergence and tightness of measures in computable Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21609v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prokhorov's Theorem in probability theory states that a family $\Gamma$ of probability measures on a Polish space is tight if and only if every sequence in $\Gamma$ has a weakly convergent subsequence. Due to the highly non-constructive nature of (relative) sequential compactness, however, the effective content of this theorem has not been studied. To this end, we generalize the effective notions of weak convergence of measures on the real line due to McNicholl and Rojas to computable Polish spaces. Then, we introduce an effective notion of tightness for families of measures on computable Polish spaces. Finally, we prove an effective version of Prokhorov's Theorem for computable sequences of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Solving Epistemic Logic Programs using Generate-and-Test with Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a general framework for generate-and-test-based solvers for epistemic logic programs that can be instantiated with different generator and tester programs, and we prove sufficient conditions on those programs for the correctness of the solvers built using this framework. It also introduces a new generator program that incorporates the propagation of epistemic consequences and shows that this can exponentially reduce the number of candidates that need to be tested while only incurring a linear overhead. We implement a new solver based on these theoretical findings and experimentally show that it outperforms existing solvers by achieving a ~3.3x speed-up and solving 91% more instances on well-known benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantitative Algebra for Fuzzy Relations and Generalised Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14361v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of the theory of quantitative algebras of Mardare, Panangaden and Plotkin where (i) the carriers of quantitative algebras are not restricted to be metric spaces and can be arbitrary fuzzy relations or generalised metric spaces, and (ii) the interpretations of the algebraic operations are not required to be nonexpansive. Our main results include: a novel sound and complete proof system, the proof that free quantitative algebras always exist, the proof of strict monadicity of the induced Free-Forgetful adjunction, the result that all monads (on fuzzy relations) that lift finitary monads (on sets) admit a quantitative equational presentation.</description>

      <title>Cut elimination for propositional cyclic proof systems with fixed-point operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinitary and cyclic proof systems are proof systems for logical formulas with fixed-point operators or inductive definitions. A cyclic proof system is a restriction of the corresponding infinitary proof system. Hence, these proof systems are generally not the same, as in the cyclic system may be weaker than the infinitary system. For several logics, the infinitary proof systems are shown to be cut-free complete. However, cyclic proof systems are characterized with many unknown problems on the (cut-free) completeness or the cut-elimination property. In this study, we show that the provability of infinitary and cyclic proof systems are the same for some propositional logics with fixed-point operators or inductive definitions and that the cyclic proof systems are cut-free complete.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Reactive Strategies Resilient to Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19985v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare games under delayed control and delay games, two types of infinite games modelling asynchronicity in reactive synthesis. In games under delayed control both players suffer from partial informedness due to symmetrically delayed communication, while in delay games, the protagonist has to grant lookahead to the alter player. Our first main result, the interreducibility of the existence of sure winning strategies for the protagonist, allows to transfer known complexity results and bounds on the delay from delay games to games under delayed control, for which no such results had been known. We furthermore analyse existence of randomized strategies that win almost surely, where this correspondence between the two types of games breaks down. In this setting, some games surely won by the alter player in delay games can now be won almost surely by the protagonist in the corresponding game under delayed control, showing that it indeed makes a difference whether the protagonist has to grant lookahead or both players suffer from partial informedness. These results get even more pronounced when we finally address the quantitative goal of winning with a probability in $[0,1]$. We show that for any rational threshold $\theta \in [0,1]$ there is a game that can be won by the protagonist with exactly probability $\theta$ under delayed control, while being surely won by alter in the delay game setting. All these findings refine our original result that games under delayed control are not determined.</description>

      <title>A formal characterization of discrete condensed objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, proposes a generalization of topology with better categorical properties. It replaces the concept of a topological space by that of a condensed set, which can be defined as a sheaf on a certain site of compact Hausdorff spaces. Since condensed sets are supposed to be a generalization of topological spaces, one would like to be able to study the notion of discreteness. There are various ways to define what it means for a condensed set to be discrete. In this paper we describe them, and prove that they are equivalent. The results have been fully formalized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>
