      <description>arXiv:2403.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recently established combinatorial index formula applying to Lie poset algebras of types B, C, and D. Then, using the extended index formula, we determine a characterization of contact Lie poset algebras of types B, C, and D corresponding to posets of height one in terms of an associated graph.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eulerian Numbers and Directed Friends-and-seats Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A(n,m)$ denote the Eulerian numbers, which count the number of permutations on $[n]$ with exactly $m$ descents, or, due to the Foata transform, the number of permutations on $[n]$ with exactly $m$ excedances. Friends-and-seats graphs, also known as friends-and-strangers graphs, are a seemingly unrelated recent construction in graph theory. In this paper, we introduce directed friends-and-seats graphs and establish a connection between these graphs and a generalization of the Eulerian numbers. We use this connection to reprove and extend a Worpitzky-like identity on generalized Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Extending Graph Burning to Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph burning is a round-based game or process that discretely models the spread of influence throughout a network. We introduce a generalization of graph burning which applies to hypergraphs, as well as a variant called ''lazy'' hypergraph burning. Interestingly, lazily burning a graph is trivial, while lazily burning a hypergraph can be quite complicated. Moreover, the lazy burning model is a useful tool for analyzing the round-based model. One of our key results is that arbitrary hypergraphs do not satisfy a bound analogous to the one in the Burning Number Conjecture for graphs. We also obtain bounds on the burning number and lazy burning number of a hypergraph in terms of its parameters, and present several open problems in the field of (lazy) hypergraph burning.</description>

      <title>Node resistance curvature in Cartesian graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Devriendt and Lambiotte recently introduced the \emph{node resistance curvature}, a notion of graph curvature based on the effective resistance matrix. In this paper, we begin the study of the behavior of the node resistance curvature under the operation of the Cartesian graph product. We study the natural question of global positivity of node resistance curvature of the Cartesian product of positively-curved graphs, and prove that, whenever $m,n\ge3$, the node resistance curvature of the interior vertices of a $m\times n$ grid is always nonpositive, while it is always nonnegative on the boundary of such grids. For completeness, we also prove a number of results on node resistance curvature in $2\times n$ grids and exhibit a counterexample to a generalization. We also give generic bounds and suggest several further questions for future study.</description>

      <title>The classification of two-distance transitive dihedrants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex transitive graph $\Gamma$ is said to be $2$-distance transitive if for each vertex $u$, the group of automorphisms of $\Gamma$ fixing the vertex $u$ acts transitively on the set of vertices at distance $1$ and $2$ from $u$, while $\Gamma$ is said to be $2$-arc transitive if its automorphism group is transitive on the set of $2$-arcs. Then $2$-arc transitive graphs are $2$-distance transitive. The classification of $2$-arc transitive Cayley graphs on dihedral groups was given by Du, Malni\v{c} and Maru\v{s}i\v{c} in [Classification of 2-arc-transitive dihedrants, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 98 (2008), 1349--1372]. In this paper, it is shown that a connected 2-distance transitive Cayley graph on the dihedral group of order $2n$ is either $2$-arc transitive, or isomorphic to the complete multipartite graph $K_{m[b]}$ for some $m\geq3$ and $b\geq2$ with $mb=2n$.</description>

      <title>A Ricci flow on graphs from effective resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new notion of curvature on the edges of a graph that is defined in terms of effective resistances. We call this the Ricci--Foster curvature. We study the Ricci flow resulting from this curvature. We prove the existence of solutions to Ricci flow on short time intervals, and prove that Ricci flow preserves graphs with nonnegative (resp. positive) curvature.</description>

      <title>Stability of graph pairs involving cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph pair $(\Gamma, \Sigma)$ is called stable if $\aut(\Gamma)\times\aut(\Sigma)$ is isomorphic to $\aut(\Gamma\times\Sigma)$ and unstable otherwise, where $\Gamma\times\Sigma$ is the direct product of $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$. A graph is called $R$-thin if distinct vertices have different neighbourhoods. $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are said to be coprime if there is no nontrivial graph $\Delta$ such that $\Gamma \cong \Gamma_1 \times \Delta$ and $\Sigma \cong \Sigma_1 \times \Delta$ for some graphs $\Gamma_1$ and $\Sigma_1$. An unstable graph pair $(\Gamma, \Sigma)$ is called nontrivially unstable if $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are $R$-thin connected coprime graphs and at least one of them is non-bipartite. This paper contributes to the study of the stability of graph pairs with a focus on the case when $\Sigma = C_n$ is a cycle. We give two sufficient conditions for $(\Gamma, C_n)$ to be nontrivially unstable, where $n \ne 4$ and $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected graph. In the case when $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected non-bipartite graph, we obtain the following results: (i) if $(\Gamma, K_2)$ is unstable, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is unstable for every even integer $n \geq 4$; (ii) if an even integer $n \ge 6$ is compatible with $\Gamma$ in some sense, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is nontrivially unstable if and only if $(\Gamma, K_2)$ is unstable; (iii) if there is an even integer $n \ge 6$ compatible with $\Gamma$ such that $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is nontrivially unstable, then $(\Gamma, C_{m})$ is unstable for all even integers $m \ge 6$. We also prove that if $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected graph and $n \ge 3$ is an odd integer compatible with $\Gamma$, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is stable.</description>

      <title>The characterization of an Alternating Sign Matrix using a triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternating Sign Matrix(ASM for short) is a square matrix which is consist of 0, 1 and -1. In this paper, we characterize an ASM by showing a bijection between alternating sign matrix and six vertex model, and a bijection between six vertex model and height function. In order to show these bijections, we define a triplet $({a}_{i, j}, {c}_{i, j}, {r}_{i, j})$ for each entry of an ASM. We also define a \textsl{track} for each index of height function, and state more properties of height function.</description>

      <title>Automorphism group of a family of distance regular graphs which are not distance transitive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_n=\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_n$ for $n\geq 4$ and $S=\{(i,0),(0,i),(i,i): 1\leq i \leq n-1\}\subset G_n$. Define $\Gamma(n)$ to be the Cayley graph of $G_n$ with respect to the connecting set $S$. It is known that $\Gamma(n)$ is a strongly regular graph with the parameters $(n^2,3n-3,n,6)$ \cite{19}. Hence $\Gamma(n)$ is a distance regular graph. It is known that every distance transitive graph is distance regular, but the converse is not true. In this paper, we study some algebraic properties of the graph $\Gamma(n)$. Then by determining the automorphism group of this family of graphs, we show that the graphs under study are not distance transitive.</description>

      <title>The unitary Cayley graph of upper triangular matrix rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unitary Cayley graph $C_R$ of a finite unital ring $R$ is the simple graph with vertex set $R$ in which two elements $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge if and only if $x-y$ is a unit of $R$. We characterize the unitary Cayley graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ of the ring of all upper triangular matrices $T_n(\mathbb{F})$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$. We show that $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ is isomorphic to the semistrong product of the complete graph $K_m$ and the antipodal graph of the Hamming graph $A(H(n,p^k))$, where $m=p^{\frac{kn(n-1)}{2}}$ and $|\mathbb{F}|=p^k$. In particular, if $|\mathbb{F}|=2$, then the graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$ has $2^{n-1}$ connected components, each component is isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,m}$, where $m=2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$. We also compute the diameter, triameter, and clique number of the graph $C_{T_n (\mathbb{F})}$.</description>

      <title>A family of symmetric graphs in relation to 2-point-transitive linear spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $\Gamma$ is $G$-symmetric if it admits $G$ as a group of automorphisms acting transitively on the set of arcs of $\Gamma$, where an arc is an ordered pair of adjacent vertices. Let $\Gamma$ be a $G$-symmetric graph such that its vertex set admits a nontrivial $G$-invariant partition ${\cal B}$, and let ${\cal D}(\Gamma, {\cal B})$ be the incidence structure with point set ${\cal B}$ and blocks $\{B\} \cup \Gamma_{\cal B}(\alpha)$, for $B \in {\cal B}$ and $\alpha \in B$, where $\Gamma_{\cal B}(\alpha)$ is the set of blocks of ${\cal B}$ containing at least one neighbour of $\alpha$ in $\Gamma$. In this paper we classify all $G$-symmetric graphs $\Gamma$ such that $\Gamma_{\cal B}(\alpha) \ne \Gamma_{\cal B}(\beta)$ for distinct $\alpha, \beta \in B$, the quotient graph of $\Gamma$ with respect to ${\cal B}$ is a complete graph, and ${\cal D}(\Gamma, {\cal B})$ is isomorphic to the complement of a $(G, 2)$-point-transitive linear space.</description>

      <title>On a mod $3$ property of $\ell $-tuples of pairwise commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group of permutations acting on $n$ elements. We investigate the double sequence $\{N_{\ell}(n)\}$ counting the number of $\ell$ tuples of elements of the symmetric group $S_n$, where the components commute, normalized by the order of $S_n$. Our focus lies on exploring log-concavity with respect to $n$: $$ N_{\ell}(n)^2 - N_{\ell}(n-1) \,\, N_{\ell}(n+1) \geq 0.$$ We establish that this depends on $n \pmod{3}$ for sufficiently large $\ell$. These numbers are studied by Bryan and Fulman as the $n$th orbifold characteristics, generalizing work of Macdonald and Hirzebruch--Hofer concerning the ordinary and string-theoretic Euler characteristics of symmetric products. Notably, $N_2(n)$ represents the partition numbers $p(n)$, while $N_{3}(n)$ represents the number of non-equivalent $n$-sheeted coverings of a torus studied by Liskovets and Medynkh. The numbers also appear in algebra since $ \vert S_n \vert \,\, N_{\ell}(n) = \left\vert Hom \left( \mathbb{Z}^{\ell},S_n\right) \right\vert $.</description>

      <title>Companion matrix, Vandermonde matrix, Jordan form, Interpolating Polynomials, and Linear Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and let $C$ be the $n\times n$ companion matrix of the monic polynomial $f(x)\in \mathbb{F}[x]$ such that $f(x) = \det(xI-C) = (x - \lambda_1)^{n_1} \cdots (x - \lambda_m)^{n_m}$ for $m$ distinct elements $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m \in \mathbb{F}$. It is shown that there is a generalized Vandermonde matrix $V$ associated with $f(x)$ such that $VCV^{-1}$ is in Jordan form, and the columns of $V^{-1}$ are connected to the Hermite interpolating polynomials, whose higher derivatives will have specific values at $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m$. If $m = n$ and $n_1 = \cdots = n_m = 1$, then the results reduce to the fact that the (classical) Vandermonde $V$ of $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$ satisfies $VCV^{-1}$ is a diagonal matrix and that the columns of $V^{-1}$ correspond to the Lagrange interpolating polynomials. This shows that the results for real polynomials and matrices also hold for polynomials and matrices over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$. Moreover, interpretations and insights of the results are given in terms of linear transformation between $\mathbb{F}^n$ and the linear space of polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[x]$ with degree less than $n$.</description>

      <title>Some results on total weight choosability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is called $(k,k')$-choosable if for any total list assignment $L$ which assigns to each vertex $v$ a set $L(v)$ of $k$ real numbers, and assigns to each edge $e$ a set $L(e)$ of $k'$ real numbers, there is a mapping $f:V\cup E\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(y)\in L(y)$ for any $y\in V\cup E$ and for any two adjacent vertices $v, v'$, $\sum_{e\in E(v)}f(e)+f(v)\neq \sum_{e\in E(v')}f(e)+f(v')$, where $E(x)$ denotes the set of incident edges of a vertex $x\in V(G)$. In this paper, we characterize a sufficient condition on
  $(1,2)$-choosable of graphs. We show that every connected $(n,m)$-graph is both $(2,2)$-choosable and $(1,3)$-choosable if $m=n$ or $n+1$, where $(n,m)$-graph denotes the graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Furthermore, we prove that some graphs obtained by some graph operations are $(2,2)$-choosable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattered subspaces and $h$-scattered subspaces have been extensively studied in recent decades for both theoretical purposes and their connections to various applications. While numerous constructions of scattered subspaces exist, relatively few are known about $h$-scattered subspaces with $h\geq2$. In this paper, we establish the existence of maximum $2$-scattered $\F_q$-subspaces in $V(r,q^6)$ whenever $r\geq 3$, $r\ne 5$, and $q$ is an odd power of $2$. Additionally, we explore the corresponding MRD codes.</description>

      <title>Spectral antisymmetry of twisted graph adjacency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a prime counting problem across the homology classes of a graph, presenting a graph-theoretical Dirichlet-type analogue of the prime number theorem. The main machinery we have developed and employed is a spectral antisymmetry theorem, revealing that the spectra of the twisted graph adjacency matrices have an antisymmetric distribution over the character group of the graph. Additionally, we derive some trace formulas based on the twisted adjacency matrices as part of our analysis.</description>

      <title>On subspaces defining linear sets of maximum rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ denote an $r$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-vector space. Let $U$ and $W$ be $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspaces of $V$, $L_U$ and $L_W$ the projective points of $\mathrm{PG}\,(V,q^n)$ defined by $U$ and $W$ respectively. We address the problem when $L_W=L_U$ under the hypothesis that $U$ and $W$ have maximum dimension, i.e., $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q} W=\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q}U=$ $rn-n $, and we give a complete characterization for $r=2$.</description>

      <title>The $k$-representation number of the random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-representation number of a graph $G$ is the minimum cardinality of the system of vertex subsets with the property that every edge of $G$ is covered at least $k$ times while every non-edge is covered at most $(k-1)$ times. In particular, for $k=1$ this notion is equivalent to the clique number of a graph $G$. Extending results of Frieze and Reed, and Eaton and Grable, we study the $k$-representation number of $G(n,1/2)$. As a tool, we will prove a sharp concentration result counting the number of induced subgraphs of $G(n,1/2)$ with density $(\frac{1}{2}+\alpha)$. In Lemma 3.7, we will show that the number of such subgraphs is close to its expected value with probability $1-\exp(-n^C)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of quaternions called Lucas-Leonardo p-quaternions and derive several fundamental properties of these numbers. Furthermore, we investigate some applications related to companion sequences associated with Leonardo quaternions. In particular, we determine Lucas-Leonardo quaternions and Francois quaternions, which are zero divisors and invertible elements in the quaternion algebra over certain finite fields.</description>

      <title>Weakly modular graphs with diamond condition, the interval function and axiomatic characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly modular graphs are defined as the class of graphs that satisfy the \emph{triangle condition ($TC$)} and the \emph{quadrangle condition ($QC$)}. We study an interesting subclass of weakly modular graphs that satisfies a stronger version of the triangle condition, known as the \emph{triangle diamond condition ($TDC$)}. and term this subclass of weakly modular graphs as the \emph{diamond-weakly modular graphs}. It is observed that this class contains the class of bridged graphs and the class of weakly bridged graphs.
  The interval function $I_G$ of a connected graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ is an important concept in metric graph theory and is one of the prime example of a transit function; a set function defined on the Cartesian product $V\times V$ to the power set of $V$ satisfying the expansive, symmetric and idempotent axioms.
  In this paper, we derive an interesting axiom denoted as $(J0')$, obtained from a well-known axiom introduced by Marlow Sholander in 1952, denoted as $(J0)$. It is proved that the axiom $(J0')$ is a characterizing axiom of the diamond-weakly modular graphs. We propose certain types of independent first-order betweenness axioms on an arbitrary transit function $R$ and prove that an arbitrary transit function becomes the interval function of a diamond-weakly modular graph if and only if $R$ satisfies these betweenness axioms. Similar characterizations are obtained for the interval function of bridged graphs and weakly bridged graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two skew diagrams are defined to be equivalent if their corresponding skew Schur functions are equal. The equivalence classes for ribbons have been classified by Billera, Thomas and van Willigenburg in 2006. In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of equivalence classes for connected skew diagrams with exactly one $2\times m$ or $m\times 2$ block of boxes for all $m\ge 2$. In particular, possible sizes of equivalence classes are one, two or four, confirming special cases of the elusive conjecture on equivalent skew connected diagrams proposed by McNamara and van Willigenburg in 2009.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Chordal Circular-arc Graphs: I. Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most elusive problem around the class of circular-arc graphs is identifying all minimal graphs that are not in this class. The main obstacle is the lack of a systematic way of enumerating these minimal graphs. McConnell [FOCS 2001] presented a transformation from circular-arc graphs to interval graphs with certain patterns of representations. We fully characterize these interval patterns for circular-arc graphs that are split graphs, thereby building a connection between minimal split graphs that are not circular-arc graphs and minimal non-interval graphs. This connection enables us to identify all minimal split graphs that are not circular-arc graphs. As a byproduct, we develop a linear-time certifying recognition algorithm for circular-arc graphs when the input is a split graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are extending results from \cite{B-Hurwitz} by building a parallel theory of simple Hurwitz numbers for the reflection groups $G(m,1,n)$. We also study analogs of the cut-and-join operators. An algebraic description as well as a description in terms of ramified covering of Hurwitz numbers is provided. An explicit formula for them in terms of Schur polynomials are provided. In addition the generating function of $G(m,1,n)$-Hurwitz numbers is shown to give rise to $m$ independent variables $\tau$-function of the KP hierarchy. Finally we provide an ELSV-formula type for these new Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>Spectral bipartite Turan problems on linear hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a graph and let $\mathcal{B}_r(F)$ be the class of $r$-uniform Berge-$F$ hypergraphs. In this paper, by establishing a relationship between the spectral radius of the adjacency tensor of a uniform hypergraph and its local structure via walks, we give a spectral asymptotic bound for $\mathcal{B}_{r}(C_3)$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs and upper bounds for the spectral radii of $\mathcal{B}_{r}(K_{2,t})$-free or $\{\mathcal{B}_{r}(K_{s,t}),\mathcal{B}_{r}(C_{3})\}$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs, where $C_{3}$ and $K_{s,t}$ are respectively the triangle and the complete bipartite graph with one part having $s$ vertices and the other part having $t$ vertices. Our work implies an upper bound for the number of edges of $\{\mathcal{B}_{r}(K_{s,t}),\mathcal{B}_{r}(C_{3})\}$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs, and extends some known work on (spectral) extreme problems of hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: We define and study the $(\nu / \lambda)$-partial alternating sign matrix polytope, motivated by connections to the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope and the $\nu$-Tamari lattice. We determine the inequality description and show this polytope is a face of the partial alternating sign matrix polytope of [Heuer, Striker 2022]. We show that the $(\nu / \lambda)$-partial ASM polytope is an order polytope and a flow polytope.</description>

      <title>Perfect codes in circulant graphs of degree $p^l-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph is an independent set of the graph such that every vertex outside the set is adjacent to exactly one vertex in the set. A circulant graph is a Cayley graph of a cyclic group. In this paper we study perfect codes in circulant graphs of degree $p^l - 1$, where $p$ is a prime and $l \ge 1$. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for such a circulant graph to admit perfect codes, give a construction of all such circulant graphs which admit perfect codes, and prove a lower bound on the number of distinct perfect codes in such a circulant graph. This extends known results for the case $l=1$ and provides insight on the general problem on the existence and structure of perfect codes in circulant graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate analogues of alternating sign matrices, called partial alternating sign matrices. We prove bijections between these matrices and several other combinatorial objects. We use an analogue of Wieland's gyration on fully-packed loops, which we relate to the study of toggles and order ideals. Finally, we show that rowmotion on order ideals of a certain poset and gyration on partial fully-packed loop configurations are in equivariant bijection.</description>

      <title>Diametric problem for permutations with the Ulam metric (optimal anticodes)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the diametric problem (i.e., optimal anticodes) in the space of permutations under the Ulam distance. That is, let $S_n$ denote the set of permutations on $n$ symbols, and for each $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$, define their Ulam distance as the number of distinct symbols that must be deleted from each until they are equal. We obtain a near-optimal upper bound on the size of the intersection of two balls in this space, and as a corollary, we prove that a set of diameter at most $k$ has size at most $2^{k + C k^{2/3}} n! / (n-k)!$, compared to the best known construction of size $n!/(n-k)!$. We also prove that sets of diameter $1$ have at most $n$ elements.</description>

      <title>Note on the spectra of Steiner distance hypermatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Steiner distance of a set of vertices in a graph is the fewest number of edges in any connected subgraph containing those vertices. The order-$k$ Steiner distance hypermatrix of an $n$-vertex graph is the $n \times \cdots \times n$ ($k$ terms) array indexed by vertices, whose entries are the Steiner distances of their corresponding indices. In the case of $k=2$, this reduces to the classical distance matrix of a graph. Graham and Pollak showed in 1971 that the determinant of the distance matrix of a tree only depends on its number $n$ of vertices. Here, we show that the hyperdeterminant of the Steiner distance hypermatrix of a tree vanishes if and only if (a) $n \geq 3$ and $k$ is odd, (b) $n=1$, or (c) $n=2$ and $k \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$. Two proofs are presented of the $n=2$ case -- the other situations were handled previously -- and we use the argument further to show that the distance spectral radius for $n=2$ is equal to $2^{k-1}-1$. Some related open questions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Minimum acyclic number and maximum dichromatic number of oriented triangle-free graphs of a given order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a digraph. Its acyclic number $\vec{\alpha}(D)$ is the maximum order of an acyclic induced subdigraph and its dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}(D)$ is the least integer $k$ such that $V(D)$ can be partitioned into $k$ subsets inducing acyclic subdigraphs. We study ${\vec a}(n)$ and $\vec t(n)$ which are the minimum of $\vec\alpha(D)$ and the maximum of $\vec{\chi}(D)$, respectively, over all oriented triangle-free graphs of order $n$. For every $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $n$ large enough, we show $(1/\sqrt{2} - \epsilon) \sqrt{n\log n} \leq \vec{a}(n) \leq \frac{107}{8} \sqrt n \log n$ and $\frac{8}{107} \sqrt n/\log n \leq \vec{t}(n) \leq (\sqrt 2 + \epsilon) \sqrt{n/\log n}$. We also construct an oriented triangle-free graph on 25 vertices with dichromatic number~3, and show that every oriented triangle-free graph of order at most 17 has dichromatic number at most 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13929v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average properties of the well-known Subset Sum Problem can be studied by the means of its randomised version, where we are given a target value $z$, random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, and an error parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, and we seek a subset of the $X_i$s whose sum approximates $z$ up to error $\varepsilon$. In this setup, it has been shown that, under mild assumptions on the distribution of the random variables, a sample of size $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ suffices to obtain, with high probability, approximations for all values in $[-1/2, 1/2]$. Recently, this result has been rediscovered outside the algorithms community, enabling meaningful progress in other fields. In this work we present an alternative proof for this theorem, with a more direct approach and resourcing to more elementary tools.</description>

      <title>Polynomially Over-Parameterized Convolutional Neural Networks Contain Structured Strong Winning Lottery Tickets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) states that randomly-initialised neural networks likely contain subnetworks that perform well without any training. Although unstructured pruning has been extensively studied in this context, its structured counterpart, which can deliver significant computational and memory efficiency gains, has been largely unexplored. One of the main reasons for this gap is the limitations of the underlying mathematical tools used in formal analyses of the SLTH. In this paper, we overcome these limitations: we leverage recent advances in the multidimensional generalisation of the Random Subset-Sum Problem and obtain a variant that admits the stochastic dependencies that arise when addressing structured pruning in the SLTH. We apply this result to prove, for a wide class of random Convolutional Neural Networks, the existence of structured subnetworks that can approximate any sufficiently smaller network.
  This result provides the first sub-exponential bound around the SLTH for structured pruning, opening up new avenues for further research on the hypothesis and contributing to the understanding of the role of over-parameterization in deep learning.</description>

      <title>A Strongly Subcubic Combinatorial Algorithm for Triangle Detection with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the algorithmic problem of finding a triangle in a graph: We give a randomized combinatorial algorithm for triangle detection in a given $n$-vertex graph with $m$ edges running in $O(n^{7/3})$ time, or alternatively in $O(m^{4/3})$ time. This may come as a surprise since it invalidates several conjectures in the literature. In particular,
  - the $O(n^{7/3})$ runtime surpasses the long-standing fastest algorithm for triangle detection based on matrix multiplication running in $O(n^\omega) = O(n^{2.372})$ time, due to Itai and Rodeh (1978).
  - the $O(m^{4/3})$ runtime surpasses the long-standing fastest algorithm for triangle detection in sparse graphs based on matrix multiplication running in $O(m^{2\omega/(\omega+1)})= O(m^{1.407})$ time due to Alon, Yuster, and Zwick (1997).
  - the $O(n^{7/3})$ time algorithm for triangle detection leads to a $O(n^{25/9} \log{n})$ time combinatorial algorithm for $n \times n$ Boolean matrix multiplication, by a reduction of V. V. Williams and R.~R.~Williams (2018).This invalidates a conjecture of A.~Abboud and V. V. Williams (FOCS 2014).
  - the $O(m^{4/3})$ runtime invalidates a conjecture of A.~Abboud and V. V. Williams (FOCS 2014) that any combinatorial algorithm for triangle detection requires $m^{3/2 -o(1)}$ time.
  - as a direct application of the triangle detection algorithm, we obtain a faster exact algorithm for the $k$-clique problem, surpassing an almost $40$ years old algorithm of Ne{\v{s}}et{\v{r}}il and Poljak (1985). This result strongly disproves the combinatorial $k$-clique conjecture.
  - as another direct application of the triangle detection algorithm, we obtain a faster exact algorithm for the \textsc{Max-Cut} problem, surpassing an almost $20$ years old algorithm of R.~R.~Williams (2005).</description>

      <title>Polyhedral realizations for crystal bases and Young walls of classical affine types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For affine Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of type $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$, $B^{(1)}_{n-1}$, $C^{(1)}_{n-1}$, $D^{(1)}_{n-1}$, $A^{(2)}_{2n-2}$, $A^{(2)}_{2n-3}$ or $D^{(2)}_{n}$, let $B(\lambda)$ and $B(\infty)$ be the crystal bases of integrable highest weight representation $V(\lambda)$ and negative part $U_q^-(\mathfrak{g})$ of quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. We consider the polyhedral realizations of crystal bases, which realize $B(\lambda)$ and $B(\infty)$ as sets of integer points of some polytopes and cones in $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$. It is a natural problem to find explicit forms of the polytopes and cones. In this paper, we introduce pairs of truncated walls, which are defined as modifications of level $2$-Young walls and describe inequalities defining the polytopes and cones in terms of level $1$-proper Young walls and pairs of truncated walls. As an application, we also give combinatorial descriptions of $\varepsilon_k^*$-functions on $B(\infty)$ in terms of Young walls and truncated walls.</description>

      <title>On q-series and the moment problem associated to local factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the moment problem and Jacobi matrix associated-- by the operator theoretic framework of the semilocal trace formula-- to each finite set $S$ of places of $\mathbb Q$ containing the archimedean place. The measure is given by the absolute value squared of the product over $S$ of local factors restricted to the critical line. We treat the case $S=\{p,\infty\}$, where a single prime $p$ is adjoined to the archimedean place. We find that all the key ingredients such as the moments, the orthogonal polynomials and the Jacobi matrices can be expressed as power series in terms of the parameter $q:=1/p$. We show that the series which appear for the moments themselves are Lambert series. The study of the $q$-series for the coefficients of the Jacobi matrix, and for the associated orthogonal polynomials reveals an intriguing integrality result: all those coefficients belong to the ring $\mathbb Z[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$ obtained by adjoining $1 / \sqrt{2}$ to the ring of integers. The main result of this paper is the conceptual explanation of this integrality property using Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the maximum parsimony tree for data with few substitutions within the NNI neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating species relationship trees, so-called phylogenetic trees, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated).
  On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present manuscript to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt; \frac{n}{8}+\frac{6}{5}-\frac{1}{10} \sqrt{\frac{5}{16} n^2+4}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;8 k-\frac{46}{5}+\frac{2}{5} \sqrt{40 k-31} $), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on a given tree $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively.</description>

      <title>Entropy of cluster DT transformations and the finite-tame-wild trichotomy of acyclic quivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cluster algebra associated with an acyclic quiver has a special mutation loop $\tau$, called the cluster Donaldson--Thomas (DT) transformation, related to the Auslander--Reiten translation. In this paper, we characterize the finite-tame-wild trichotomy for acyclic quivers by the sign stability of $\tau$ introduced in [IK21] and its cluster stretch factor. As an application, we compute several kinds of entropies of $\tau$ and other mutation loops. In particular, we show that the algebraic and categorical entropies of $\tau$ are commonly given by the logarithm of the spectral radius of the Coxeter matrix associated with the quiver, and that any mutation loop of finite or tame acyclic quivers have zero algebraic entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We characterize the oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ groups whose $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology algebra yields no essential $n$-fold Massey products for every $n&gt;2$, in terms of the associated oriented graph. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology algebra of such oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ groups is isomorphic to the exterior Stanley-Reisner $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra associated to the same oriented graph. This work also aims at providing a concrete and group-theoretic introduction to the study of Massey products in Galois cohomology for non-specialists, especially graduate students working in profinite group theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burke and Teng introduced a two-player combinatorial game Atropos based on Sperner's lemma, and showed that deciding whether one has a winning strategy for Atropos is PSPACE-complete. In the original Atropos game, the players must color a node adjacent to the last colored node. Burke and Teng also mentioned a variant Atropos-k in which each move is at most of distance k of the previous move, and asked a question on determining the computational complexity of this variant. In this paper, we answer this question by showing that for any fixed integer k (k&gt;=2), Atropos-k is PSPACE-complete by reduction from True Quantified Boolean Formula (TQBF).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Version Control Systems, such as Git and Mercurial, manage the history of a project as a Directed Acyclic Graph encoding the various divergences and synchronizations happening in its life cycle. A popular workflow in the industry, called the feature branch workflow, constrains these graphs to be of a particular shape: a unique main branch, and non-interfering feature branches. Here we focus on the uniform random generation of those graphs with n vertices, including k on the main branch, for which we provide three algorithms, for three different use-cases. The first, based on rejection, is efficient when aiming for small values of k (more precisely whenever k = O($\sqrt$ n)). The second takes as input any number k of commits in the main branch, but requires costly precalculation. The last one is a Boltzmann generator and enables us to generate very large graphs while targeting a constant k/n ratio. All these algorithms are linear in the size of their outputs.</description>

      <title>Turtles, Hats and Spectres: Aperiodic structures on a Rhombic tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes derive aperiodic monotiles (arXiv:2303.10798) from a set of rhombuses with matching rules. This dual construction is used to simplify the proof of aperiodicity by considering the tiling as a colouring game on a Rhombille tiling. A simple recursive substitution system is then introduced to show the existence of a non-periodic tiling without the need for computer-aided verification.
  A new cut-and-project style construction linking the Turtle tiling with 1-dimensional Fibonacci words provides a second proof of non-periodicity, and an alternative demonstration that the Turtle can tile the plane.
  Deforming the Turtle into the Hat tile then provides a third proof for non-periodicity by considering the effect on the lattice underlying the Rhombille tiling.
  Finally, attention turns to the Spectre tile. In collaboration with Erhard K\"unzel and Yoshiaki Araki, we present two new substitution rules for generating Spectre tilings. This pair of conjugate rules show that the aperiodic monotile tilings can be considered as a 2-dimensional analog to Sturmian words.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Borel version of the local lemma, i.e. we show that, under suitable assumptions, if the set of variables in the local lemma has a structure of a Borel space, then there exists a satisfying assignment which is a Borel function. The main tool which we develop for the proof, which is of independent interest, is a parallel version of the Moser-Tardos algorithm which uses the same random bits to resample clauses that are far enough in the dependency graph.</description>

      <title>Subgraph Games in the Semi-Random Graph Process and Its Generalization to Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.07034v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-random graph process is a single-player game that begins with an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively selects a vertex $v$ and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible.
  We focus on the problem of constructing a subgraph isomorphic to an arbitrary, fixed graph $G$. Let $\omega = \omega(n)$ be any function tending to infinity as $n \to \infty$. In (Omri Ben-Eliezer et al. "Semi-random graph process". In: Random Structures &amp; Algorithms 56.3 (2020), pp. 648-675) it was proved that asymptotically almost surely one can construct $G$ in less than $n^{(d-1)/d} \omega$ rounds where $d \ge 2$ is the degeneracy of $G$. It was also proved that the result is sharp for $G = K_{d+1}$, that is, asymptotically almost surely it takes at least $n^{(d-1)/d} / \omega$ rounds to create $K_{d+1}$. Moreover, the authors conjectured that their general upper bound is sharp for all graphs $G$. We prove this conjecture here.
  We also consider a natural generalization of the process to $s$-uniform hypergraphs, the semi-random hypergraph process in which $r \ge 1$ vertices are presented at random, and the player then selects $s-r \ge 1$ vertices to form an edge of size~$s$. Our results for graphs easily generalize to hypergraphs when $r=1$; the threshold for constructing a fixed $s$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is, again, determined by the degeneracy of $G$. However, new challenges are mounting when $r \ge 2$; thresholds are not even known for complete hypergraphs. We provide bounds for this family and determine thresholds for some sparser hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.13952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine the result of T. Lam \cite{L} on embedding the space $E_n$ of electrical networks on a planar graph with $n$ boundary points into the totally non-negative Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_{\geq 0}(n-1,2n)$ by proving first that the image lands in $\mathrm{Gr}(n-1,V)\subset \mathrm{Gr}(n-1,2n)$ where $V\subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is a certain subspace of dimension $2n-2$. The role of this reduction in the dimension of the ambient space is crucial for us. We show next that the image lands in fact inside the Lagrangian Grassmannian $\mathrm{LG}(n-1,V)\subset \mathrm{Gr}(n-1,V)$. As it is well known $\mathrm{LG}(n-1)$ can be identified with $\mathrm{Gr}(n-1,2n-2)\cap \mathbb{P} L$ where $L\subset \bigwedge^{n-1}\mathbb R^{2n-2}$ is a subspace of dimension equal to the Catalan number $C_n$, moreover it is the space of the fundamental representation of the symplectic group $Sp(2n-2)$ which corresponds to the last vertex of the Dynkin diagram. We show further that the linear relations cutting the image of $E_n$ out of $\mathrm{Gr}(n-1,2n)$ found in \cite{L} define that space $L$. This connects the combinatorial description of $E_n$ discovered in \cite{L} and representation theory of the symplectic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the parallel Moser-Tardos Algorithm. We prove that if we restrict attention to a class of problems whose dependency graphs have subexponential growth, then the expected total number of random bits used by the algorithm is constant; in particular, it is independent from the number of variables. This is achieved by using the same random bits to resample variables which are far enough in the dependency graph.
  There are two corollaries. First, we obtain a deterministic algorithm for finding a satisfying assignment, which for any class of problems as in the previous paragraph runs in time O(n), where n is the number of variables. Second, we present a Borel version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thomas and Williams conjectured that rowmotion acting on the rational $(a,b)$-Tamari lattice has order $a+b-1$. We construct an equivariant bijection that proves this conjecture when $b\equiv 1\pmod a$; in fact, we determine the entire orbit structure of rowmotion in this case, showing that it exhibits the cyclic sieving phenomenon. We additionally show that the down-degree statistic is homomesic for this action. In a different vein, we consider the action of rowmotion on Barnard and Reading's biCambrian lattices. Settling a different conjecture of Thomas and Williams, we prove that if $c$ is a bipartite Coxeter element of a coincidental-type Coxeter group $W$, then the orbit structure of rowmotion on the $c$-biCambrian lattice is the same as the orbit structure of rowmotion on the lattice of order ideals of the doubled root poset of type $W$.</description>

      <title>On the hull and interval numbers of oriented graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, for a given oriented graph $D$, we study its interval and hull numbers, respectively, in the oriented geodetic, P3 and P3* convexities. This last one, we believe to be formally defined and first studied in this paper, although its undirected version is well-known in the literature.
  Concerning bounds, for a strongly oriented graph D, and the oriented geodetic convexity, we prove that $ohng(D)\leq m(D)-n(D)+2$ and that there is at least one such that $ohng(D) = m(D)-n(D)$. We also determine exact values for the hull numbers in these three convexities for tournaments, which imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute them. These results allow us to deduce polynomial-time algorithms to compute $ohnp(D)$ when the underlying graph of $D$ is split or cobipartite.
  Moreover, we provide a meta-theorem by proving that if deciding whether $oing(D)\leq k$ or $ohng(D)\leq k$ is NP-hard or W[i]-hard parameterized by $k$, for some $i\in\mathbb{Z_+^*}$, then the same holds even if the underlying graph of $D$ is bipartite. Next, we prove that deciding whether $ohnp(D)\leq k$ or $ohnps(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if $D$ is acyclic and its underlying graph is bipartite; that deciding whether $ohng(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if $D$ is acyclic; that deciding whether $oinp(D)\leq k$ or $oinps(D)\leq k$ is NP-complete, even if $D$ has no directed cycles and the underlying graph of $D$ is a chordal bipartite graph; and that deciding whether $oinp(D)\leq k$ or $oinps(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if the underlying graph of $D$ is split.
  Finally, also argue that the interval and hull numbers in the oriented P3 and P3* convexities can be computed in cubic time for graphs of bounded clique-width by using Courcelle's theorem.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorems via Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of analytic combinatorics is dedicated to the creation of effective techniques to study the large-scale behaviour of combinatorial objects. Although classical results in analytic combinatorics are mainly concerned with univariate generating functions, over the last two decades a theory of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) has been developed to study the asymptotic behaviour of multivariate sequences. In this work we survey ACSV from a probabilistic perspective, illustrating how its most advanced methods provide efficient algorithms to derive limit theorems, and comparing the results to past work deriving combinatorial limit theorems. Using the results of ACSV, we provide a SageMath package that can automatically compute (and rigorously verify) limit theorems for a large variety of combinatorial generating functions. To illustrate the techniques involved, we also establish explicit local central limit theorems for a family of combinatorial classes whose generating functions are linear in the variables tracking each parameter. Applications covered by this result include the distribution of cycles in certain restricted permutations (proving a limit theorem stated as a conjecture in recent work of Chung et al.), integer compositions, and $n$-colour compositions with varying restrictions and values tracked. Key to establishing these explicit results in arbitrary dimension is an interesting symbolic determinant, which we compute by conjecturing and then proving an appropriate $LU$-factorization. It is our hope that this work provides readers a blueprint to apply the powerful tools of ACSV to prove central limit theorems in their own work, making them more accessible to combinatorialists, probabilists, and those in adjacent fields.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an density of long tight cycle minus one hyperedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by $\mathcal{C}^-_{\ell}$ the $3$-uniform hypergraph obtained by removing one hyperedge from the tight cycle on $\ell$ vertices. It is conjectured that the Tur\'an density of $\mathcal{C}^-_{5}$ is $1/4$. In this paper, we make progress toward this conjecture by proving that the Tur\'an density of $\mathcal{C}^-_{\ell}$ is $1/4$, for every sufficiently large $\ell$ not divisible by $3$. One of the main ingredients of our proof is a forbidden-subhypergraph characterization of the hypergraphs, for which there exists a tournament on the same vertex set such that every hyperedge is a cyclic triangle in this tournament.
  A byproduct of our method is a human-checkable proof for the upper bound on the maximum number of almost similar triangles in a planar point set, which was recently proved using the method of flag algebras by Balogh, Clemen, and Lidick\'y.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A pebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number $\pi(G)$ is the smallest $t$ so that from any initial configuration of $t$ pebbles it is possible, after a sequence of pebbling moves, to place a pebble on any given target vertex. In this paper, we provide the first results on the pebbling numbers of snarks. Until now, only the Petersen graph had its pebbling number correctly established, although attempts had been made for the Flower and Watkins snarks.</description>

      <title>Towards Crossing-Free Hamiltonian Cycles in Simple Drawings of Complete Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a longstanding conjecture that every simple drawing of a complete graph on $n \geq 3$ vertices contains a crossing-free Hamiltonian cycle. We strengthen this conjecture to "there exists a crossing-free Hamiltonian path between each pair of vertices" and show that this stronger conjecture holds for several classes of simple drawings, including strongly c-monotone drawings and cylindrical drawings. As a second main contribution, we give an overview on different classes of simple drawings and investigate inclusion relations between them up to weak isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Locality in Sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (PFR) Conjecture, we develop a theory of locality in sumsets, with applications to John-type approximation and sets with small doubling. First we show that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le (1-\epsilon) 2^d |A|$ is non-degenerate then $A$ is covered by $O(2^d)$ translates of a $d$-dimensional generalised arithmetic progression ($d$-GAP) $P$ with $|P| \le O_{d,\epsilon}(|A|)$; thus we obtain one of the polynomial bounds required by PFR, under the non-degeneracy assumption that $A$ is not efficiently covered by $O_{d,\epsilon}(1)$ translates of a $(d-1)$-GAP. We also prove a stability result showing for any $\epsilon,\alpha&gt;0$ that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le (2-\epsilon)2^d|A|$ is non-degenerate then some $A' \subset A$ with $|A'|&gt;(1-\alpha)|A|$ is efficiently covered by either a $(d+1)$-GAP or $O_{\alpha}(1)$ translates of a $d$-GAP. This `dimension-free' bound for approximate covering makes for a stark contrast with exact covering, where the required number of translates grows exponentially with $d$. We further show that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is non-degenerate with $|A+A| \le (2^d + \ell)|A|$ and $\ell \le 0.1 \cdot 2^d$ then $A$ is covered by $\ell+1$ translates of a $d$-GAP $P$ with $|P| \le O_d(|A|)$; this is tight, in that $\ell+1$ cannot be replaced by any smaller number. The above results also hold for $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, replacing GAPs by a suitable common generalisation of GAPs and convex bodies. In this setting the non-degeneracy condition holds automatically, so we obtain essentially optimal bounds with no additional assumption on $A$. These results are all deduced from a unifying theory, in which we introduce a new intrinsic structural approximation of any set, which we call the `additive hull', and develop its theory via a refinement of Freiman's theorem with additional separation properties.</description>

      <title>On $(n,m)$-chromatic numbers of graphs having bounded sparsity parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $(n,m)$-graph is characterised by having $n$ types of arcs and $m$ types of edges. A homomorphism of an $(n,m)$-graph $G$ to an $(n,m)$-graph $H$, is a vertex mapping that preserves adjacency, direction, and type. The $(n,m)$-chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{n,m}(G)$, is the minimum value of $|V(H)|$ such that there exists a homomorphism of $G$ to $H$. The theory of homomorphisms of $(n,m)$-graphs have connections with graph theoretic concepts like harmonious coloring, nowhere-zero flows; with other mathematical topics like binary predicate logic, Coxeter groups; and has application to the Query Evaluation Problem (QEP) in graph database.
  In this article, we show that the arboricity of $G$ is bounded by a function of $\chi_{n,m}(G)$ but not the other way around. Additionally, we show that the acyclic chromatic number of $G$ is bounded by a function of $\chi_{n,m}(G)$, a result already known in the reverse direction. Furthermore, we prove that the $(n,m)$-chromatic number for the family of graphs with a maximum average degree less than $2+ \frac{2}{4(2n+m)-1}$, including the subfamily of planar graphs with girth at least $8(2n+m)$, equals $2(2n+m)+1$. This improves upon previous findings, which proved the $(n,m)$-chromatic number for planar graphs with girth at least $10(2n+m)-4$ is $2(2n+m)+1$.
  It is established that the $(n,m)$-chromatic number for the family $\mathcal{T}_2$ of partial $2$-trees is both bounded below and above by quadratic functions of $(2n+m)$, with the lower bound being tight when $(2n+m)=2$. We prove $14 \leq \chi_{(0,3)}(\mathcal{T}_2) \leq 15$ and $14 \leq \chi_{(1,1)}(\mathcal{T}_2) \leq 21$ which improves both known lower bounds and the former upper bound. Moreover, for the latter upper bound, to the best of our knowledge we provide the first theoretical proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new, powerful method for counting elements in a multiset. As a first application, we use this algorithm to study the number of occurrences of patterns in a permutation. For patterns of length 3 there are two Wilf classes, and the general behaviour of these is reasonably well-known. We slightly extend some of the known results in that case, and exhaustively study the case of patterns of length 4, about which there is little previous knowledge. For such patterns, there are seven Wilf classes, and based on extensive enumerations and careful series analysis, we have conjectured the asymptotic behaviour for all classes.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs density. IV. New graphs with the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal conjectured that for every graph $H$, there exists $c&gt;0$ such that every $H$-free graph $G$ has a clique or a stable set of size at least $|G|^c$ (a graph is $H$-free if it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$). Alon, Pach, and Solymosi reduced the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture to the case when $H$ is {\em prime} (that is, $H$ cannot be obtained by vertex-substitution from smaller graphs); but until now, it was not shown for any prime graph with more than five vertices.
  We will provide infinitely many prime graphs that satisfy the conjecture. Let $H$ be a graph with the property that for every prime induced subgraph $G'$ with $|G'|\ge 3$, $G'$ has a vertex of degree one and a vertex of degree $|G'|-2$. We will prove that every graph $H$ with this property satisfies the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture, and infinitely many graphs with this property are prime. More generally, say a graph is {\em buildable} if every prime induced subgraph with at least three vertices has a vertex of degree one. We prove that if $H_1$ and $\overline{H_2}$ are buildable, there exists $c&gt;0$ such that every graph $G$ that is both $H_1$-free and $H_2$-free has a clique or a stable set of size at least $|G|^c$.
  Our proof uses a new technique of ``iterative sparsification'', where we pass to a sequence of successively more restricted induced subgraphs. This approach also extends to ordered graphs and to tournaments. For ordered graphs, we obtain a theorem which significantly extends a recent result of Pach and Tomon about excluding monotone paths; and for tournaments, we obtain infinitely many new prime tournaments that satisfy the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture (in tournament form).</description>

Abstract: An edge $e$ of a matching covered graph $G$ is removable if $G-e$ is also matching covered. Carvalho, Lucchesi, and Murty showed that every brick $G$ different from $K_4$ and $\overline{C_6}$ has at least $\Delta-2$ removable edges, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$. In this paper, we generalize the result to irreducible near-bricks, where a graph is irreducible if it contains no single ear of length three or more.</description>

Abstract: A Neumaier graph is a non-complete edge-regular graph containing a regular clique. In this work, we prove several results on the existence of small strictly Neumaier graphs. In particular, we present a theoretical proof of the uniqueness of the smallest strictly Neumaier graph with parameters $(16,9,4;2,4)$, we establish the existence of a strictly Neumaier graph with parameters $(25,12,5;2,5)$, and we disprove the existence of strictly Neumaier graphs with parameters $(25,16,9;3,5)$, $(28,18,11;4,7)$, $(33,24,17;6,9)$, $(35,22,12;3,5)$ and $(55,34,18;3,5)$. Our proofs use combinatorial techniques and a novel application of integer programming methods.</description>

      <title>Flat origami is Turing Complete</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat origami refers to the folding of flat, zero-curvature paper such that the finished object lies in a plane. Mathematically, flat origami consists of a continuous, piecewise isometric map $f:P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ along with a layer ordering $\lambda_f:P\times P\to \{-1,1\}$ that tracks which points of $P$ are above/below others when folded. The set of crease lines that a flat origami makes (i.e., the set on which the mapping $f$ is non-differentiable) is called its \textit{crease pattern}. Flat origami mappings and their layer orderings can possess surprisingly intricate structure. For instance, determining whether or not a given straight-line planar graph drawn on $P$ is the crease pattern for some flat origami has been shown to be an NP-complete problem, and this result from 1996 led to numerous explorations in computational aspects of flat origami. In this paper we prove that flat origami, when viewed as a computational device, is Turing complete. We do this by showing that flat origami crease patterns with \textit{optional creases} (creases that might be folded or remain unfolded depending on constraints imposed by other creases or inputs) can be constructed to simulate Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular automaton that was proven to be Turing complete by Matthew Cook in 2004.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Ramanujan hypergraphs by using hypergraph coverings. We first show that the spectrum of a $k$-fold covering $\bar{H}$ of a connected hypergraph $H$ contains the spectrum of $H$, and that it is the union of the spectrum of $H$ and the spectrum of an incidence-signed hypergraph with $H$ as underlying hypergraph if $k=2$, which generalizes Bilu-Linial result on graph coverings. We give a lower bound for the second largest eigenvalue of a $d$-regular hypergraph by universal cover, which generalizes Alon-Boppana bound on $d$-regular graphs and Feng-Li bound on $(d,r)$-regular hypergraphs. By using interlacing family of polynomials, we prove that every $(d,r)$-regular hypergraph has a right-sided Ramanujan $2$-covering, and has a left-sided Ramanujan $2$-covering if the roots of the matching polynomial of its incident graph satisfy some condition. By Ramanujan $2$-coverings, we prove the existence of some families of infinite many left-sided or right-sided $(d,r)$-regular Ramanujan hypergraphs under certain conditions on $d$ and $r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Melchior's inequality implies that the average line-length in a simple, rank-$3$, real-representable matroid is less than $3$. A similar result holds for complex-representable matroids, using Hirzebruch's inequality, but with a weaker bound of $4$. We show that the average plane-size in a simple, rank-$4$, complex-representable matroid is bounded above by an absolute constant, unless the matroid is the direct-sum of two lines. We also prove that, for any integer $k$, in complex-representable matroids with rank at least $2k-1$, the average size of a rank-$k$ flat is bounded above by a constant depending only on $k$. Finally, we prove that, for any integer $r\ge 2$, the average flat-size in rank-$r$ complex-representable matroids is bounded above by a constant depending only on $r$. We obtain our results using a theorem, due to Ben Lund, that gives a good estimate on the number of rank-$k$ flats in a complex-representable matroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a finite real reflection group, the reflection length of each element is equal to the codimension of its fixed space, and the two coincident functions determine a partial order structure called the absolute order. In complex reflection groups, the reflection length is no longer always equal to the codimension of fixed space, and the two functions give rise to two different partial orders on the group. We characterize the elements $w$ in the combinatorial family $G(m, p, n)$ of complex reflection groups for which the intervals below $w$ in these two posets coincide. We also explore the relationship between this property and other natural properties of elements in complex reflection groups; some general theory of posets arising from subadditive functions on groups; and the particular case of subadditive functions on the symmetric group.</description>

Abstract: The reconfiguration graph of the $k$-colorings, denoted $R_k(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colorings of $G$ and two colorings are adjacent in $R_k(G)$ if they differ in color on exactly one vertex. A graph $G$ is said to be recolorable if $R_{\ell}(G)$ is connected for all $\ell\geq \chi(G)$+1. In this paper, we study the recolorability of several graph classes restricted by forbidden induced subgraphs. We prove some properties of a vertex-minimal graph $G$ which is not recolorable. We show that every (triangle, $H$)-free graph is recolorable if and only if every (paw, $H$)-free graph is recolorable. Every graph in the class of $(2K_2,\ H)$-free graphs, where $H$ is a 4-vertex graph except $P_4$ or $P_3$+$P_1$, is recolorable if $H$ is either a triangle, paw, claw, or diamond. Furthermore, we prove that every ($P_5$, $C_5$, house, co-banner)-free graph is recolorable.</description>

      <title>Leaky Positive Semidefinite Forcing on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\ell$-leaky positive semidefinite forcing and the $\ell$-leaky positive semidefinite number of a graph, $Z_{(\ell)}^+{G}$, which combines the positive semidefinite color change rule with the addition of leaks to the graph. Furthermore, we determine general properties of $Z_{(\ell)}^+{G}$ and $Z_{(\ell)}^+{G}$ for various graphs, including path graphs, complete graphs, wheel graphs, complete bipartite graphs, trees, hypercubes, and prisms. We also define $\ell$-leaky positive semidefinite forts with the purpose of unveiling differences between $\ell$-leaky standard forcing and $\ell$-leaky positive semidefinite forcing.</description>

      <title>Cycle-factors in oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a positive integer. A $k$-cycle-factor of an oriented graph is a set of disjoint cycles of length $k$ that covers all vertices of the graph. In this paper, we prove that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that for $n$ sufficiently large, any oriented graph on $n$ vertices with both minimum out-degree and minimum in-degree at least $(1/2-c)n$ contains a $k$-cycle-factor for any $k\geq4$. Additionally, under the same hypotheses, we also show that for any sequence $n_1, \ldots, n_t$ with $\sum^t_{i=1}n_i=n$ and the number of the $n_i$ equal to $3$ is $\alpha n$, where $\alpha$ is any real number with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1/3$, the oriented graph contains $t$ disjoint cycles of lengths $n_1, \ldots, n_t$. This conclusion is the best possible in some sense and refines a result of Keevash and Sudakov.</description>

      <title>Trees with flowers: A catalog of integer partition and integer composition trees with their asymptotic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present families of combinatorial classes described as trees with nodes that can carry one of two types of "flowers": integer partitions or integer compositions. Two parameters on the flowers of trees will be considered: the number of "petals" in all the flowers (petals' weight) and the number of edges in the petals of all the flowers (flowers' weight). We give explicit expressions of their generating functions and deduce general formulas for the asymptotic growth of their coefficients and the expectations of their concentrated distributions.</description>

      <title>A necessary and sufficient condition for bounds on the sum of a list of real numbers and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $x_1,...,x_n$ be a list of real numbers, let $s :=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$ and let $h:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function. We gave a necessary and sufficient condition for $s&gt;h(n)$ (respectively, $s&lt;h(n)$). Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph, let $\{H_1,...,H_n\}$ and $\{V_1,...,V_n\}$ be a decomposition and a partition of $G$, respectively. Let $H_{i,j}$ and $V_{i,j}, i\leq j,$ be the union of $H_i,...,H_j$ and $V_i,...,V_j$, respectively, where subscripts are taken modulo $n$. $G$ is \emph{generalized periodic} or \emph{partition-transitive} if for each pair of integers $(i,j)$, $H_{i,i+k}$ and $H_{j,j+k}$ or $V_{i,i+k}$ and $V_{j,j+k}$ are isomorphic for all $k$, $1\leq k\leq n$, respectively. Let $f:E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be mappings, let the \emph{weight} of $f$ or $g$ on $G$ be $\Sigma_{e\in E}f(e)$ or $\Sigma_{v\in V}g(v)$, respectively. Suppose that parameters $\lambda$ and $\xi$ of $G$ can be expressed as the minimum or maximum weight of specified $f$ and $g$, respectively. Then our conditions imply a necessary and sufficient condition for $\lambda(G_1)=h(n)$ (respectively, $\xi(G_2)=h(n)$), where $G_1$ is generalized periodic and $G_2$ is partition-transitive. For example, the crossing number $\textrm{cr}(\odot(T^n))$ of a periodic graph $\odot(T^n)$, $\textrm{cr}(\odot(T^n))=h(n)$. As applications, we obtained $\textrm{cr}(C(4n;\{1,4\}))$ of the circulant $C(4n;\{1,4\})$, the paired domination number of $C_5\Box C_n$ and the upper total domination number of $C_4\Box C_n$.</description>

      <title>Coloring locally sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-locally sparse if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by its neighborhood contains at most $k$ edges. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov showed that for $f &gt; 0$ if a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ is $\Delta^2/f$-locally-sparse, then $\chi(G) = O\left(\Delta/\log f\right)$. We introduce a more general notion of local sparsity by defining graphs $G$ to be $(k, F)$-locally-sparse for some graph $F$ if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$ the subgraph induced by the neighborhood of $v$ contains at most $k$ copies of $F$. Employing the R\"{o}dl nibble method, we prove the following generalization of the above result: for every bipartite graph $F$, if $G$ is $(k, F)$-locally-sparse, then $\chi(G) = O\left( \Delta /\log\left(\Delta k^{-1/|V(F)|}\right)\right)$. This improves upon results of Davies, Kang, Pirot, and Sereni who consider the case when $F$ is a path. Our results also recover the best known bound on $\chi(G)$ when $G$ is $K_{1, t, t}$-free for $t \geq 4$, and hold for list and correspondence coloring in the more general so-called ''color-degree'' setting.</description>

      <title>The distribution of Weierstrass points on a tropical curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.07920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that on a metric graph of genus $g$, a divisor of degree $n$ generically has $g(n-g+1)$ Weierstrass points. For a sequence of generic divisors on a metric graph whose degrees grow to infinity, we show that the associated Weierstrass points become distributed according to the Zhang canonical measure. In other words, the limiting distribution is determined by effective resistances on the metric graph. This distribution result has an analogue for complex algebraic curves, due to Neeman, and for curves over non-Archimedean fields, due to Amini.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Conway and Coxeter's combinatorial results concerning frieze patterns, we sketch an introduction to the theory of cluster algebras and cluster categories for acyclic quivers. The goal is to show how these more abstract theories provide a conceptual explanation for phenomena concerning friezes, principally integrality and periodicity.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on semi-retractions and the Ramsey property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of a semi-retraction between two first order structures (in typically different signatures) that was introduced by the second author as a link between the Ramsey property and generalized indiscernible sequences. We further these connections between combinatorics and model theory, and look at semi-retractions through a new lens establishing transfers of the Ramsey property and finite Ramsey degrees under quite general conditions that are optimal as demonstrated by counterexamples. Finally, we compare semi-retractions to the category theoretic notion of a pre-adjunction.</description>

      <title>Everything is possible: constructing spectrahedra with prescribed facial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any finite set of nonnegative integers, there exists a closed convex set whose facial dimension signature coincides with this set of integers, that is, the dimensions of its nonempty faces comprise exactly this set of integers. In this work, we show that such sets can be realised as solution sets of systems of finitely many convex quadratic inequalities, and hence are representable via second-order cone programming problems, and are, in particular, spectrahedral. It also follows that these sets are facially exposed, in contrast to earlier constructions. We obtain a lower bound on the minimum number of convex quadratic inequalities needed to represent a closed convex set with prescribed facial dimension signature, and show that our bound is tight for some special cases. Finally, we relate the question of finding efficient representations with indecomposability of integer sequences and other topics, and discuss a substantial number of open questions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of modularity-based approaches for nodes clustering in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical analysis and node clustering in hypergraphs constitute an emerging topic suffering from a lack of standardization. In contrast to the case of graphs, the concept of nodes' community in hypergraphs is not unique and encompasses various distinct situations. In this work, we conducted a comparative analysis of the performance of modularity-based methods for clustering nodes in binary hypergraphs. To address this, we begin by presenting, within a unified framework, the various hypergraph modularity criteria proposed in the literature, emphasizing their differences and respective focuses. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art codes available to maximize hypergraph modularities for detecting node communities in binary hypergraphs. Through exploration of various simulation settings with controlled ground truth clustering, we offer a comparison of these methods using different quality measures, including true clustering recovery, running time, (local) maximization of the objective, and the number of clusters detected. Our contribution marks the first attempt to clarify the advantages and drawbacks of these newly available methods. This effort lays the foundation for a better understanding of the primary objectives of modularity-based node clustering methods for binary hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One can explicitly compute the generators of a surface cluster algebra either combinatorially, through dimer covers of snake graphs, or homologically, through the CC-map applied to indecomposable modules over the appropriate algebra. Recent work by Musiker, Ovenhouse and Zhang used Penner and Zeitlin's decorated super Teichm{\"u}ller theory to define a super version of the cluster algebra of type $A$ and gave a combinatorial formula to compute the even generators. We extend this theory by giving a homological way of explicitly computing these generators by defining a super CC-map for type $A$.</description>
