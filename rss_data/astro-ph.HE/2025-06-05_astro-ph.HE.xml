      <title>The QPO in REJ1034+396 originates in the hot corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: REJ1034+396 is one of the few active galactic nuclei with a significant quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). The QPO has been observed in over 1 Ms of XMM-Newton observations spanning over a decade. We investigate the power spectral density function (PSD) of 7 long (~90 ks) XMM-Newton observations of the active galactic nucleus REJ1034+396 in two energy bands. The soft (0.3-0.5 keV) band targets emission from the disk, while the hard (2-7 keV) band isolates the primary X-ray continuum emission from the corona. The QPO is significantly detected in the hard band of 5 of the 7 observations. The best fitting models indicate that the QPO detection in both bands is entirely attributable to the coronal emission with no additional contribution from the disk. This explains the strong coherence between the hard and soft bands at the QPO frequency. The covariance spectrum is consistent with this picture as the variability at QPO frequencies is attributed solely to fluctuations in the hot corona. The time lag as a function of energy is well described by a ~2000 s intrinsic soft lag, resulting from the disk responding to emission from the corona, that undergoes phase wrapping at approximately the QPO frequency. By demonstrating that in this system the QPO arises in the corona, we provide new insights into the mechanisms generating QPOs.</description>

      <title>Detailed Time Resolved Spectral and Temporal Investigations of SGR J1550-5418 Bursts Detected with Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a time-resolved spectral analysis of magnetar bursts originating from SGR J1550-5418. Our analysis utilizes a two-step methodology for temporal segmentation of the data. We first generated and fitted overlapping time segments. Subsequently, we obtained non-overlapping time segments with varying lengths based on their spectral evolution patterns, employing a machine learning algorithm called k-means clustering. For the fitting process, we employed three distinct models, namely a modified blackbody (MBB-RCS), a double blackbody (BB+BB), and a power law with an exponential cut-off (COMPT) model. We found that nearly all of the time segments fit well with the COMPT model. Both the average peak energy in the ${\nu}$F${\nu}$ spectra (Epeak) and Photon Index parameters follow a Gaussian distribution with the means ${\sim}$30 keV and -0.5, respectively. Furthermore, there is a strong positive correlation between the cooler and hotter temperature parameters of the BB+BB model, and both two parameters show a Gaussian distribution with peaks ${\sim}$4 keV and 12 keV, respectively. Additionally, we found that the distribution of the temperature parameter of the MBB-RCS model can be fitted with a skewed Gaussian function with a peak ${\sim}$9-10 keV. Lastly, we searched for quasiperiodic spectral oscillations (QPSOs) in the hardness ratio evolution of the bursts. We identified five potential QPSO candidates at frequencies ranging from ${\sim}$15 Hz to ${\sim}$68 Hz. We discuss and compare these results with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Fast Luminous Extragalactic Transients in the VLA Sky Survey: Implications for the rates of Accretion-Induced Collapse Events, Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio wavelengths offer a unique window into high-energy astrophysical phenomena that may be obscured or too rapidly evolving to be captured at other wavelengths. Leveraging data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey, we perform a systematic search for fast, luminous transients with characteristic timescales $\lesssim 3$ years in the nearby universe ($z \leq 0.3$). We report the discovery of five such transients, and classify them based on their synchrotron emission energetics and host galaxy properties. From this sample, we derive observational constraints on the volumetric rates of certain corresponding transient classes. We limit the rates of accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs with dense circumstellar medium interaction (and those producing pulsar wind nebulae) at $\lesssim 1.10_{-0.90}^{+2.60}$% ($\lesssim 0.20_{-0.10}^{+5.80}$%) of the local Type Ia supernova rate, respectively, broadly consistent with theoretical predictions. For AT2018cow-like radio-bright luminous fast blue optical transients, we estimate a rare occurrence rate of $\lesssim 0.02_{-0.01}^{+0.32}$% of the local core-collapse supernova rate. We constrain the local volumetric rates of long- and short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to be $\lesssim 11.46_{-9.48}^{+26.28}$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim 80.88_{-66.90}^{+185.87}$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$, respectively. These estimates incorporate beaming corrections, with median detectable viewing angles derived from afterglow simulations of $\sim 0.4$ and $\sim 0.3$ radians for long- and short-duration GRBs. Our findings highlight the potential of radio surveys to uncover rare, energetic transients. We emphasize the critical role of coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up in fully characterizing these enigmatic events.</description>

      <title>Single-pulse-based interstellar scintillation studies of RRATs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of irregularly spaced pulses of rotating radio transients (RRATs) complicates interstellar scintillation studies. In this letter, we report the primary scintillation parameters of a sample of RRATs using pairwise correlations of pulse spectra. Moreover, from the measured scintillation velocities, we constrain their transverse velocities. We also find a reduced modulation index, $\rm{m=0.13\pm0.01}$, for RRAT~J1538+2345. Several possible explanations are discussed. Furthermore, the single-pulse-based interstellar scintillation technique is applicable to other pulsar populations, including nulling pulsars and those with short scintillation timescales, and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Jet Dynamics and Collimation Characteristics of 0241+622 on Parsec Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a detailed analysis of the jet structure and dynamics of the source 0241+622 on milliarcsecond (mas) scales. We stacked images from multiple epochs to better recover the crosssection of the jet. By analyzing the relationship between jet width and distance, we observed that the jet exhibits a parabolic shape from the core, spanning a region from 0.12 to 6.1 mas. This structure suggests the acceleration and collimation processes of the jet. Beyond 18 mas from the core, the jet adopts a conical shape, and the expansion speed of the jet becomes faster within the range from 4500 to 6500 mas. We obtained the core shift of this source using five pairs of data from VLBA at 1.6 GHz to 43 GHz. Based on previous studies, through proper motion analysis of the jet components, we estimated the angle between the jet and the line of sight to be approximately 65.7{\deg}, so 1 mas corresponds to 0.95 pc (de-projected distance). We then obtained the velocity field of the source within 3.14 mas from the central black hole and found that the jet exhibits accelerated motion within this range. At approximately 6.1 mas from the core, we observed that the jet width begins to decrease, which we identified as possibly corresponding to the Bondi radius of this source. The reduction in jet width may be related to changes in the external environmental pressure, particularly within the Bondi radius, indicating that the jet dynamics and collimation characteristics are strongly influenced by the surrounding medium conditions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Detection of High-Redshift Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Era of EP and SVOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a promising probe of the high-redshift Universe, but their detection remains observationally challenging. In this work, we explore the detectability of high-$z$ GRBs by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Using a population synthesis model calibrated to $Swift$ GRB observations, we develop a tool to estimate high-$z$ GRB detection rates for instruments with specific energy bands and sensitivities. Our results indicate that \emph{EP}/WXT could detect $\sim5.1^{+3.4}_{-2.4}$ (with 68\% confidence level) GRBs annually at $z&gt;6$, compared to $\sim0.7^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$ $\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z&gt;6$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. While \emph{EP} cannot independently determine redshifts (requiring optical/near-infrared follow-up), its assumed $\sim30\%$ follow-up efficiency yields $\sim1.5^{+1.0}_{-0.7}$ confirmed $z&gt;6$ GRBs annually. \emph{SVOM}, equipped with dedicated follow-up telescopes, will ensure robust high-$z$ GRB confirmations. We anticipate that \emph{EP} and \emph{SVOM} will open new avenues for utilizing enlarged samples of high-$z$ GRBs to explore the early Universe. Moreover, \emph{EP} will assemble a substantial sample of soft, low-luminosity GRBs at low-to-intermediate redshifts, providing critical insights into the structure of GRB jets.</description>

      <title>The Chinese Pulsar Timing Array data release I. Single pulsar noise analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) has collected observations from 57 millisecond pulsars using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) for close to three years, for the purpose of searching for gravitational waves (GWs). To robustly search for ultra-low-frequency GWs, pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) need to use models to describe the noise from the individual pulsars. We report on the results from the single pulsar noise analysis of the CPTA data release I (DR1). Conventionally, power laws in the frequency domain are used to describe pulsar red noise and dispersion measurement (DM) variations over time. Employing Bayesian methods, we found the choice of number and range of frequency bins with the highest evidence for each pulsar individually. A comparison between a dataset using DM piecewise measured (DMX) values and a power-law Gaussian process to describe the DM variations shows strong Bayesian evidence in favour of the power-law model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the constraints obtained from four independent software packages are very consistent with each other. The short time span of the CPTA DR1, paired with the large sensitivity of FAST, has proved to be a challenge for the conventional noise model using a power law. This mainly shows in the difficulty to separate different noise terms due to their covariances with each other. Nineteen pulsars are found to display covariances between the short-term white noise and long-term red and DM noise. With future CPTA datasets, we expect that the degeneracy can be broken. Finally, we compared the CPTA DR1 results against the noise properties found by other PTA collaborations. While we can see broad agreement, there is some tension between different PTA datasets for some of the overlapping pulsars. This could be due to the differences in the methods and frequency range compared to the other PTAs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the progenitor models of fast radio bursts from population synthesis with the first CHIME/FRB catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic radio transients with unknown origins. We performed comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog to test whether the FRB population tracks the cosmic star formation history directly or requires a delay. By fully considering CHIME's complex selection effects and beam response, we find that the hypothesis that the FRB population tracks the SFH is not ruled out by the current data, although a small delay is preferred. This is consistent with the scenario in which young magnetars formed through core-collapse supernovae serve as the progenitors of FRBs. However, we estimate the local volumetric rate of FRB sources with energy above $10^{38}$ erg to be $2.3^{+2.4}_{-1.2} \times 10^5~\rm{Gpc}^{-3}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with previous results. This high volumetric rate means the core-collapse magnetar scenario alone cannot fully account for the observed population. Further theoretical efforts are required to explore alternative or additional progenitor channels for FRBs.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the structure of the stratified ultra-fast outflows in PDS 456 with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple clumpy wind components ($v_{out}\sim0.2-0.3c$) in the luminous quasar PDS 456 have recently been resolved by XRISM in the Fe-K band for the first time. In this paper, we investigate the structure of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) using coordinated observations from XRISM, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, along with the self-consistently calculated photoionization model \texttt{PION}. Our results reveal a stratified ionization structure likely driven by the radiation field, characterized by a relation between wind velocity and ionization parameter $v_{out}\propto\xi^{(0.38\pm0.06)}$. To evaluate the impact of the screening effect, we tested all possible order permutations of six \texttt{PION} components. We find that highly ionized UFOs ($\log\xi&gt;4.5$) are insensitive to their relative positions, whereas the soft X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim3$ and $v_{out}\sim0.27c$) and the lowest-ionized hard X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim4.1$ and $v_ {out}\sim0.23c$) are statistically favored -- based on the evidence from both the C-statistic and Bayesian analysis -- to occupy the middle and innermost layers, respectively. This suggests a possible trend where slower UFOs are launched from regions closer to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The soft X-ray UFO is found to be thermally unstable, regardless of its relative position. However, its location remains unclear. Our sequence analysis and its similarity to hard X-ray UFOs suggest that they may be co-spatial, while variability constraints support its location within the broad-line region at sub-parsec scales. Simulations with the gate-valve opened XRISM show that high-resolution soft X-ray data can enhance the reliability of our results. Furthermore, simulations with the future X-ray mission NewAthena demonstrate its capability to resolve the absorber sequence and spatial distributions, enabling the determination of UFO structures and their roles in AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>A revamped understanding of Cosmic Rays and Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15850v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interesting data on Gamma Ray Burts (GRBs) and Cosmic Rays (CRs) have recently been made public. GRB221009A has a record ``peak energy". The CR electron spectrum has been measured to unprecedented high energies and exhibits a ``knee" akin to the ones in all-particle or individual-element CR nuclei. IceCube has not seen high-energy neutrinos associated with GRBs. AMS has published a CR positron spectrum conducive to much speculation. We examine these data in the light of the ``CannonBall Model" of GRBs and CRs, in which they are intimately related and which they do strongly validate.</description>

      <title>Estimating Bolometric Luminosities of Type 1 Quasars with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured, type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}. Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have also made our code publicly available.</description>

Abstract: The chemical characterization of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of the neutral gas of a galaxy at z&gt;6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as $d_{II}=620^{+230}_{-140}$ pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column density, $\log(N(HI)/cm^{-2})=22.5\pm0.3$, which is the highest one at z&gt;6 determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal column density, $\log(N(ZnII)/cm^{-2})&gt;14.3$. The observed metallicity of the host galaxy system is [Zn/H]&gt;-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be common features of galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Precise Timing Analysis of Four Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables with TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analysed high time-resolution optical photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study the timing behaviour of four intermediate polar-like objects, namely, V1460 Her, 1RXS J045707.4+452751, Swift J0958.0-4208, and V842 Cen. In the case of V1460 Her, we refined the measurement of its orbital period. Long-term observations suggest a gradual decrease in the orbital period of V1460 Her, and the stable light curve during the TESS observations indicates its quiescent state. We detected a beat period of 1290.6 $\pm$ 0.5 s for the first time for the source 1RXS J045707.4+452751, suggesting a possible disc-overflow accretion scenario. For the sources Swift J0958.0-4208 and V842 Cen, we determined periods 6.11 $\pm$ 0.02 h and 3.555 $\pm$ 0.005 h, respectively, which can be provisionally suggested to be orbital periods. These findings provide valuable insights into the accretion processes and long-term evolution of these intriguing binary systems.</description>

      <title>A systematic search for AGN obscuration variability in the Chandra archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be studied by measuring changes in the line-of-sight column density, $N_{\rm H,los}$, over time. This can be accomplished by monitoring AGN over long periods of time and at all timescales. However, this can only be done for a few selected objects as it is resource intensive. Therefore, the best option currently is to focus on population statistics based on the available archival data. In this work, we estimate a lower limit on the fraction of sources in the local $(z&lt;0.1)$ universe that display spectral variability among observations ($54\pm11$%), indicative of $N_{\rm H,los}$ variability. Interestingly, we also find that the variable fraction is similar for both Seyfert 1 ($f_{\rm Sy1}\sim61^{+13}_{-15}$%) and Seyfert 2 ($f_{\rm Sy2}\sim47\pm15$%) galaxies, and discuss why we might find a slightly higher $f_{\rm Sy1}$. We also present a sample of 43 Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies with multiple Chandra observations whose properties make them promising $N_{\rm H,los}$-variable targets. We discuss the accuracy of our method, and search for potential dependencies on the timescale between variable and non-variable observation pairs within a given source. In agreement with previous studies, we find evidence that more variability occurs on longer timescales than on shorter timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GollumFit, a framework designed for performing binned-likelihood analyses on neutrino telescope data. GollumFit incorporates model parameters common to any neutrino telescope and also model parameters specific to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We provide a high-level overview of its key features and how the code is organized. We then discuss the performance of the fitting in a typical analysis scenario, highlighting the ability to fit over tens of nuisance parameters. We present some examples showing how to use the package for likelihood minimization tasks. This framework uniquely incorporates the particular model parameters necessary for neutrino telescopes, and solves an associated likelihood problem in a time-efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Modelling the selection of galaxy groups with end to end simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups and hydro simulations.</description>

      <title>Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion by the Nuclear Star Cluster: the Case of M31*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as M31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an extremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\sim10^8~\rm~M_\odot$). In this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a previously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar mass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous eccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss is assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic giant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31* and together provide a mass injection rate of $\sim4\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady state on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool ($T\sim10^3-10^4~\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established. This disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the central SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of $\sim2\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of few depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate global inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\sim10^7-10^8~\rm K$) plasma within 0.2 parsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude that the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has important implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local universe.</description>

      <title>Probing Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter $-$ A PTA-PPA Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight axion-like dark matter (ALDM) is a leading candidate in the dark matter realm, characterized by its prominent wave properties on astronomical scales. Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Pulsar Polarization Arrays (PPAs) aim to detect this dark matter through timing and polarization measurements, respectively, of pulsars. The PTA relies on gravitational effects, as the ALDM halo perturbs the spacetime metric within the Milky Way, while the PPA detects non-gravitational effects, namely cosmological birefringence induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with photons. These two methods complement each other, synergistically enhancing the pulsar array's capability to identify the ALDM signals in the data. In this article, we provide a foundational development of this synergy. We begin by revisiting previously derived two-point correlation functions for both PTA and PPA, and expand our analysis to include correlations between timing and polarization signals. We then construct likelihood functions for PTA and combined PTA-PPA analyses within a Bayesian framework, aimed at detecting the characteristic correlations of ALDM signals. We emphasize the non-Gaussianity of the ALDM timing signals, which arises from their non-linear dependence on the field, in contrast to the Gaussian nature of its polarization signals. To address the complexities introduced, we approach this investigation in two ways: one involves a Gaussian approximation with proper justifications, while the other derives the formalism from the generic Gaussian characteristics of the ALDM field. We anticipate that these efforts will lead to further developments in PTA and PTA-PPA analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling the high-brightness state of the recurrent nova T CrB as an enhanced mass-transfer event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T~Coronae Borealis is the nearest symbiotic recurrent nova. Twice in the last two centuries, in 1866 and 1946, the accreted material ignited on the surface of the white dwarf via runaway thermonuclear fusion reactions and produced a nova eruption. Both eruptions occurred approximately midway through a transient state of high luminosity. A possible explanation of such a state is a dwarf-nova-like outburst, which may arise from a transient increase in the mass-transfer rate of the donor star. We simulate the response of an accretion disk to an event of enhanced mass-transfer that is ``interrupted'' by a pre-eruption dip associated to the convective phase leading to the thermonuclear runaway, and model the resulting optical light curve using the parameters of the T~CrB binary. Our model represents the first attempt to reproduce the transient high-accretion state. The observed brightening can be satisfactorily reproduced by models of an accretion disk with a viscosity parameter $\alpha = 3$, an event of enhanced mass-transfer with a duration of $\Delta t = 15$\,yr, and quiescent and high-state mass-transfer rates of $2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, M_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ and $1.9 \times 10^{-7} \, M_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$, respectively, while the pre-eruption dip can be reproduced by the small, accelerated expansion of the inner disk radius, at an average velocity of 0.02\,km\,s$^{-1}$. Our model is also capable of reproducing the observed changes in color of T~CrB throughout the transient event.</description>

      <title>The Hourglass Simulation: A Catalog for the Roman High-Latitude Time-Domain Core Community Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simulation of the time-domain catalog for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's High-Latitude Time-Domain Core Community Survey. This simulation, called the Hourglass simulation, uses the most up-to-date spectral energy distribution models and rate measurements for ten extra-galactic time-domain sources. We simulate these models through the design reference Roman Space Telescope survey: four filters per tier, a five day cadence, over two years, a wide tier of 19 deg$^2$ and a deep tier of 4.2 deg$^2$, with $\sim$20% of those areas also covered with prism observations. We find that a science-independent Roman time-domain catalog, assuming a S/N at max of &gt;5, would have approximately 21,000 Type Ia supernovae, 40,000 core-collapse supernovae, around 70 superluminous supernovae, $\sim$35 tidal disruption events, 3 kilonovae, and possibly pair-instability supernovae. In total, Hourglass has over 64,000 transient objects, 11 million photometric observations, and 500,000 spectra. Additionally, Hourglass is a useful data set to train machine learning classification algorithms. We show that SCONE is able to photometrically classify Type Ia supernovae with high precision ($\sim$95%) to a z &gt; 2. Finally, we present the first realistic simulations of non-Type Ia supernovae spectral-time series data from Roman's prism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide a new, well-controlled expansion of the equation of state of dense matter from zero to finite temperatures ($T$) while covering a wide range of charge fractions ($Y_Q$), from pure neutron to isospin symmetric nuclear matter. Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers using the equation of state inferred from neutron star observations. We discuss how knowledge from low-energy nuclear experiments and heavy-ion collisions can be directly incorporated into the expansion. We also suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can be used to infer the finite temperature equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y_Q$ expansions without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\sim1-2 \ n_{\rm sat}$) within $5\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. We investigate the sources of numerical and theoretical uncertainty and discuss future directions of study.</description>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) correspond to the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (C-O WD) star in a binary system, triggered by the accretion of material from another star, or the merger/collision with a secondary WD. Their phenomenal luminosity -- several billion times that of the sun -- has motivated their use as cosmological distance indicators and led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. SNe Ia are also the main producers of iron and hence play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. While recent observations have confirmed the basic theoretical picture of an exploding C-O WD star whose luminosity is powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, a number of uncertainties remain concerning the nature of the binary companion and the explosion mechanism. Several lines of evidence point towards the existence of multiple progenitor channels in order to explain the full range of the observed diversity. A complete physical understanding of these energetic stellar explosions remains a long-lasting goal of modern astrophysics.</description>

      <title>BatAnalysis -- A Comprehensive Python Pipeline for Swift BAT Time-Tagged Event Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a coded aperture gamma-ray instrument with a large field of view that was designed to detect and localize transient events. When a transient is detected, either on-board or externally, the BAT saves time-tagged event (TTE) data which provides the highest quality information of the locations of the photons on the detector plane and their energies. This data can be used to produce spectra, lightcurves, and sky images of a transient event. While these data products are produced by the Swift Data Center and can be produced by current software, they are often preset to certain time and energy intervals which has limited their use in the current time domain and multi-messenger environment. Here, we introduce a new capability for the BatAnalysis python package to download and process TTE data under an open-source pythonic framework that allows for easy interfacing with other python packages. The new capabilities of the BatAnalysis software allows for TTE data to be used by the community in a variety of advanced customized analyses of astrophysical sources which BAT may have TTE data for, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB), Soft Gamma Repeaters, magnetars, and many other sources. We highlight the usefulness of the BatAnalysis package in analyzing TTE data produced by an on-board GRB trigger, a FRB external trigger, a sub-threshold detection of the LMXB EXO 0748-676, and an external trigger of a GRB that BAT detected during a slew.</description>

Abstract: We reanalyze the spectral lag data for 56 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the cosmological rest frame to search for Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use the technique of profile likelihood to deal with the nuisance parameters, corresponding to a constant time lag in the GRB rest frame and an unknown intrinsic scatter, while the parameter of interest is the energy scale for LIV ($E_{QG}$). With this method, we do not obtain a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ up to the Planck scale. Thus, we can obtain one-sided lower limits on $E_{QG}$ in a seamless manner. Therefore, the 95\% c.l. lower limits which we thus obtain on $E_{QG}$ are then given by: $E_{QG}\geq 2.07 \times 10^{14}$ GeV and $E_{QG}\geq 3.71\times 10^{5}$ GeV, for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Weighing The Options: The Unseen Companion in LAMOST J2354 is Likely a Massive White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19004</link>

Abstract: LAMOST J235456.73+335625 (J2354) is a binary system hosting a $\sim 0.7~\rm M_\odot$ K dwarf and a $\sim 1.4~\rm M_\odot$ dark companion, supposedly a neutron star, in a 0.48d orbit. Here we present high- and low-resolution spectroscopy to better constrain the properties of the system. The low-resolution spectrum confirms that the luminous star is a slightly metal-poor K dwarf and strengthens the limits on any optical flux from the dimmer companion. We use the high-resolution spectra to measure atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_{\rm rot}\sin i$) and abundances for 8 elements for the K dwarf. We refine the mass of the compact object to $M_{\rm co} \sim 1.3~\rm M_\odot$ with a minimum mass of $M_{\rm co, min} = 1.23\pm0.04~\rm M_\odot$. The expected overabundance of intermediate-mass elements from the incident supernova ejecta is not detected in the K-dwarf atmosphere. This contrasts with known binaries hosting neutron stars where almost all companions show evidence for polluting material. Moving the neutron-star progenitor further from the K-dwarf at the time of explosion to minimize atmospheric pollution requires a finely-tuned kick to produce the current orbital separation of $\sim 3.3~\rm R_\odot$. Instead, we find that a massive white dwarf with a cooling age of $\gtrsim 3~$Gyr satisfies all observational constraints. The system likely experienced two common-envelope phases leading to its current state because the white dwarf progenitor was massive enough to ignite He-shell burning. The system will become a cataclysmic variable in the distant future when the K-dwarf evolves off of the main sequence. These short-period high-$q$ binaries represent an intriguing formation pathway for compact double white dwarf binaries and thermonuclear supernovae. An ultraviolet spectrum is the most promising avenue for directly detecting the white dwarf companion.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation-based hot CGM model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements probing the hot CGM in X-rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulations to build a fully self-consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We construct a lightcone and generate mock X-ray observations. We quantify the projection effects, namely the locally correlated large-scale structure in X-rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments. We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X-ray surface brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $\beta$, the exponent quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry forward the current state-of-the-art by also showing the impact of the locally correlated environment on the measured X-ray surface brightness profiles. We also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5-11}\ M_\odot$, $10^{11-11.2}\ M_\odot$, and $10^{11.2-11.5}\ M_\odot$. We find that the contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles increases when the stellar mass decreases.</description>

      <title>Energy Density Functional of Confined Quarks: an Improved Ansatz</title>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a robust framework for modeling interacting many-body systems, including the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used ansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U \propto n^{\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local energy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities to $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction.</description>

      <title>Axion Superradiance in Dipole Magnetic Fields of Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the axion-photon coupling by superradiance due to a plasma instability in the magnetospheres of millisecond pulsars. We compute the growth rate of a superradiant axion cloud in a dipole magnetic field, and give a semi-analytical formula for the superradiance rate for the lowest state. By requiring the associated instability time to be longer than the characteristic age of the supermassive black-widow millisecond pulsar PSR J0952-0607, we examine the pulsar-timing array constraints on axions of mass $\sim 10^{-12}\text{ eV}$. We find that competitive axion bounds from plasma instabilities are unlikely unless a new high spin pulsar is discovered.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair -- the detailed derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a very detailed derivation of solutions describing hairy black holes within the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory, which were previously reported in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.171402}{Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 171402}. These black holes support a strong magnetic field that polarizes the electroweak vacuum and creates a condensate of massive fields carrying superconducting currents along the black hole horizon. The currents, in turn, generate a ``corona'' of magnetic vortex segments attached to the horizon at both ends. The condensate and corona together constitute the black hole hair. The extremal solutions approach, in the far field, the magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om configuration, with a total mass that is {\it lower} than the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate. This makes the removal of the hair energetically unfavorable. The maximally hairy black holes exhibit masses comparable to terrestrial values, with approximately 11\% of their total mass stored in the hair. Given that these solutions arise within a well-tested theoretical framework, they are likely to have physical relevance.</description>
