      <title>Multi-level structured deformations: relaxation via a global method approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some relaxation and integral representation results for energy functionals in the setting of structured deformations, with special emphasis given to the case of multi-level structured deformations. In particular, we present an integral representation result for an abstract class of variational functionals in this framework via a global method for relaxation and identify, under quite general assumptions, the corresponding relaxed energy densities through the study of a related local Dirichlet-type problem.
  Some applications to specific relaxation problems are also mentioned, showing that our global method approach recovers some previously established results.</description>

      <title>A function space approach to the shape optimization of the Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a shape optimization problem for a heat-conducting fluid governed by a Boussinesq system. The main goal is to determine an optimal domain shape that yields a temperature distribution as uniform as possible. Initially, we analyze the state problem, prove its well-posedness and establish a local boundary regularity result for the weak solution. We then demonstrate the existence of an optimal shape and derive a first-order optimality condition. This requires the derivation and analysis of the adjoint system associated with the Boussinesq model, as well as a rigorous treatment of the directional derivatives of the objective functional under appropriate domain perturbations. Finally, we present numerical experiments that illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Global Solutions for 5D Quadratic Fourth-Order Schr\"{o}dinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove small data scattering for the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation with quadratic nonlinearity \begin{equation*}
  i\partial_t u+\Delta^2 u+\alpha u^2 + \beta \bar{u}^2=0\qquad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^5 \end{equation*} for $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$. We extend the space-time resonance method, originally introduced by Germain, Masmoudi, and Shatah, to the setting involving the bilaplacian. We show that under a smallness condition on the initial data measured in a suitable norm, the solution satisfies $\|u\|_{L^{\infty}_x }\lesssim t^{-\frac{5}{4}} $ and scatters to the solution to the free equation. Although our work builds upon an established method, the fourth-order nature of the equation presents substantial challenges, requiring different techniques to overcome them.</description>

      <title>A remark for characterizing blowup introduced by Giga and Kohn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giga and Kohn studied the blowup solutions for the equation $v_{t} - \Delta v - |v|^{p - 1} v = 0 $ and characterized the asymptotic behavior of $v$ near a singularity. In the proof, they reduced the problem to a Liouville theorem for the equation $\Delta u - \frac{1}{2} x \cdot \nabla u + |u|^{p - 1} u - \beta u = 0$ where $\beta = \frac{1}{p - 1}$ and $|u|$ is bounded. This article is a remark for their work and we will show when $u \geq 0$, the boundedness condition for $|u|$ can be removed.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of $L^2$-Normalized solutions for the periodic Schr\"{o}dinger system of Hamiltonian type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system of Hamiltonian type \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{l} -\Delta u+V(x)u=\partial_v H(x,u,v)+\omega v, \ x \in \mathbb{R}^N, \\ -\Delta v+V(x)v=\partial_u H(x,u,v)+\omega u,\ x \in \mathbb{R}^N, \\ \displaystyle\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|z|^2dx=a^2, \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where the potential function $V(x)$ is periodic, $z:=(u,v):\mathbb{R}^N\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$, $\omega\in \mathbb{R}$ arises as a Lagrange multiplier, $a&gt;0$ is a prescribed constant. The main result in this paper establishes the existence and multiplicity of $L^2$-normalized solutions for the above nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system with a class of non-autonomous nonlinearity $H(x,u,v)$. The proofs combine Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, perturbation argument and the multiplicity theorem of Ljusternik-Schnirelmann. In addition, we obtain bifurcation results of this problem.</description>

      <title>Riesz transform, function spaces and their applications on infinite dimensional compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact connected group $G$, consider the infinitesimal generator $-L$ of a central symmetric Gaussian convolution semigroup $(\mu_t)_{t&gt;0}$. We establish several regularity results of the solution to the Poisson equation $LU=F$, both in strong and weak senses. To this end, we introduce two classes of Lipschitz spaces for $1\le p\le \infty$: $\Lambda_{\theta}^p$, defined via the associated Markov semigroup, and $\mathrm L_{\theta}^p$, defined via the intrinsic distance. In the strong sense, we prove a priori Sobolev regularity and Lipschitz regularity in the class of $\Lambda_{\theta}^p$ space. In the distributional sense, we further show local regularity in the class of $\mathrm L_{\theta}^{\infty}$ space. These results require some strong assumptions on $-L$. Our main techniques build on the differentiability of the associated semigroup, explicit dimension-free $L^p$ ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) boundedness of first and second order Riesz transforms, and a comparison between the two Lipschitz norms.</description>

      <title>Local H\"older Regularity For Nonlocal Porous Media And Fast Diffusion Equations With General Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that locally bounded, local weak solutions to certain nonlocal, nonlinear diffusion equations modeled on the fractional porous media and fast diffusion equations given by \begin{align*} \partial_t u + (-\Delta)^s(|u|^{m-1}u) = 0 \quad \mbox{ for } \quad 0&lt;s&lt;1 \quad\text{and}\quad m&gt;0 \end{align*} are locally H\"older continuous. We work with bounded, measurable kernels and provide the corresponding $L^{\infty}_{loc} \rightarrow C^{0,\alpha}_{loc}$ De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory for the equation via a delicate analysis of the set of singularity/degeneracy in a geometry dictated by the solution itself and a careful analysis of far-off effects. In particular, our results are in the spirit of interior regularity, requiring the equation to hold only locally, and thus are new even for positive solutions of the equation with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Gradient higher integrability for degenerate parabolic double phase systems with two modulating coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an interior gradient higher integrability result for weak solutions to degenerate parabolic double phase systems involving two modulating coefficients. To be more precise, we study systems of the form \begin{align*}
  u_t-\operatorname{div} \left(a(z)|Du|^{p-2}Du+ b(z)|Du|^{q-2}Du\right)=-\operatorname{div} \left(a(z)|F|^{p-2}F+ b(z)|F|^{q-2}F\right), \end{align*} where $2\leq p\leq q &lt; \infty$ and the modulating coefficients $a(z)$ and $b(z)$ are non-negative, with $a(z)$ being uniformly continuous and $b(z)$ being H\"{o}lder continuous. We further assume that the sum of two modulating coefficients is bounded from below by some positive constant. To establish the gradient higher integrability result, we introduce a suitable intrinsic geometry and develop a delicate comparison scheme to separate and analyze the different phases--namely, the $p$-phase, $q$-phase and $(p,q)$-phase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first regularity result in the parabolic setting that addresses general double phase systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the hyperbolic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (HNLS) on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. We obtain the sharp local well-posedness up to the critical regularity for cubic nonlinearity and in critical spaces for higher odd nonlinearities. Moreover, when the initial data is small, we prove the global existence and scattering for the solutions to HNLS with higher nonlinearities (except the cubic one) in critical Sobolev spaces. The main ingredient of the proof is the sharp up to the endpoint local/global-in-time Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>SBH-ellipticity of the relaxed interfacial energy density in the context of second-order structured deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from an energy comprised of both a bulk term and a surface term, set in the space of special functions of bounded hessian, $SBH$, a relaxation problem in the context of second-order structured deformations was studied in Fonseca-Hagerty-Paroni. It was shown, via the global method for relaxation, that the relaxed functional admits an integral representation and the relaxed energy densities were identified. In this paper we show that, under certain hypotheses on the original densities, the corresponding relaxed energy densities verify the same type of growth conditions and the surface energy density satisfies a specific ``convexity-type'' property, i.e. it is $SBH$-elliptic.</description>

      <title>The effects of pressure loads in the dimension reduction of elasticity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dimensional reduction from three to two dimensions in hyperelastic materials subject to a live load, modeled as a constant pressure force. Our results demonstrate that this loading has a significant impact in higher-order scaling regimes, namely those associated with von K\'arm\'an-type theories, where a nontrivial interplay arises between the elastic energy and the pressure term. In contrast, we rigorously show that in lower-order bending regimes, as described by Kirchhoff-type theories, the pressure load does not influence the minimizers. Finally, after identifying the corresponding $\Gamma$-limit, we conjecture that a similar independence from the pressure term persists in the most flexible membrane regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a direct and an inverse problem for the bi-wave operator $(\Box^2)$ along with second and lower order time-dependent perturbations. In the direct problem, we prove that the operator is well-posed, given initial and boundary data in suitable function spaces. In the inverse problem, we prove uniqueness of the lower order time-dependent perturbations from the partial input-output operator. The restriction in the measurements are considered by restricting some of the Neumann data over a portion of the lateral boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness for the transport equation for currents (Geometric Transport Equation) when the driving vector field is time-dependent, Lipschitz in space and merely integrable in time. This extends previous work where well-posedness was shown in the case of a time-independent, Lipschitz vector field. The proof relies on the decomposability bundle and requires to extend some of its properties to the class of functions that in one direction are only absolutely continuous, rather than Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>Modular topologies on vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the topological structures induced on vector spaces by convex modulars that do not satisfy the $\Delta_2$ condition, with particular focus on their applications to variable exponent spaces such as \( \ell^{(p_n)} \) and \( L^{p(\cdot)} \). The motivation behind this investigation is its applicability to the study of boundary value problems involving the variable exponent $p(x)$-Laplacian when $p(x)$ is unbounded, a line of research recently opened by the authors. Fundamental topological properties are analyzed, including separation axioms, countability axioms, and the relationship between modular convergence and classical topological concepts such as continuity. Attention is given to the relation between modular and norm topologies. Special emphasis is placed on the openness of modular balls, the impact of the \(\Delta_2\)-condition, and duality with respect to modular topologies.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel Approach to the Weyl Law for Schr\"odinger Operators on Non-compact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work by the authors, the heat kernel expansion for Schr\"odinger-type operators on noncompact manifolds was studied. Motivated by that work, this paper studies Weyl's law and the semiclassical Weyl's law for Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\Delta + V$ and $\hbar^2\Delta + V$ on noncompact complete manifolds with bounded geometry. We assume that the potential $V(x)$ satisfies certain H\"older continuity conditions and tends to $+\infty$ as $x$ approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Parisi measures for enriched convex vector spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the PDE approach to mean-field spin glasses, it has been observed that the free energy of convex spin glass models could be enriched by adding an extra parameter in its definition, and that the thermodynamic limit of the enriched free energy satisfies a partial differential equation. This parameter can be thought of as a matrix-valued path, and the usual free energy is recovered by setting this parameter to be the constant path taking only the value $0$. Furthermore, the enriched free energy can be expressed using a variational formula, which is a natural extension of the Parisi formula for the usual free energy. For models with scalar spins the Parisi formula can be expressed as an optimization problem over a convex set, and it was shown in [arXiv:1402.5132] that this problem has a unique optimizer thanks to a strict convexity property. For models with vector spins, the Parisi formula cannot easily be written as a convex optimization problem. In this paper, we generalize the uniqueness of Parisi measures proven in [arXiv:1402.5132] to the enriched free energy of models with vector spins when the extra parameter is a strictly increasing path. Our approach relies on a Gateaux differentiability property of the free energy and the envelope theorem.</description>

      <title>Transport models for wave propagation in scattering media with nonlinear absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the propagation of high-frequency waves in highly-scattering media where physical absorption of a nonlinear nature occurs. Using the classical tools of the Wigner transform and multiscale analysis, we derive semilinear radiative transport models for the phase-space intensity and the diffusive limits of such transport models. As an application, we consider an inverse problem for the semilinear transport equation, where we reconstruct the absorption coefficients of the equation from a functional of its solution. We obtain a uniqueness result on the inverse problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain monotonicity and convexity results for the heat content of domains in Riemannian manifolds and in Euclidean space subject to various initial temperature conditions. We introduce the notion of a strictly decreasing temperature set, and show that it is a sufficient condition to ensure monotone heat content. In addition, in Euclidean space, we construct a domain and an initial condition for which the heat content is not monotone, as well as a domain and an initial condition for which the heat content is monotone but not convex.</description>

      <title>Stability and decay rate estimates for a nonlinear dispersed flow reactor model with boundary control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation whose boundary conditions contain a single control input. This model describes a chemical reaction of the type ``$A \to $ product'', occurring in a dispersed flow tubular reactor. The existence and uniqueness of solutions to the nonlinear Cauchy problem under consideration are established by applying the theory of strongly continuous semigroups of operators. We also prove the stability of the equilibrium of the closed-loop system with a proposed feedback law. Additionally, using Lyapunov's direct method, we evaluate the exponential decay rate of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity for nonlocal elliptic equations over Reifenberg flat domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sharp boundary regularity of solutions to nonlocal elliptic equations arising from operators comparable to the fractional Laplacian over Reifenberg flat sets and with null exterior condition. More precisely, if the operator has order $2s$ then the solution is $C^{s-\varepsilon}$ regular for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$ provided the flatness parameter is small enough. The proof relies on an induction argument and its main ingredients are the construction of a suitable barrier and the comparison principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine semiclassical measures for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact hyperbolic $(n+1)$-manifolds. We prove their support must contain the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic submanifold. Our proof adapts the argument of Dyatlov and Jin to higher dimensions and classifies the closures of horocyclic orbits using Ratner theory. An important step in the proof is a generalization of the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen to Fourier integral operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses an inverse problem for a semi-discrete parabolic equation, which consists of identifying the right-hand side of the equation based on solution measurements at an intermediate time and within a spatial subdomain. This result can be applied to establish a stability estimate for the spatially dependent potential function. Our approach relies on a novel semi-discrete Carleman estimate, whose parameter is constrained by the mesh size. As a consequence of the discrete terms arising in the Carleman inequality, this method naturally introduces an error term related to the solution's initial condition.</description>

      <title>Continuous Revival of the Periodic Schr\"{o}dinger Equation with Piecewise $C^2$ Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the revivals of the one-dimensional periodic Schr\"odinger equation with a piecewise $C^2$ potential function. As has been observed through numerical simulations of the equation with various initial data and potential functions, the solution, while remaining fractalized at irrational times, exhibits a form of revival at rational times. The goal is to prove that the solution at these rational times is given by a finite linear combination of translations and dilations of the initial datum, plus an additional continuous term, which we call "continuous revival". In pursuit of this result, we present a review of relevant properties of the periodic Schr\"odinger equation as an eigenvalue problem, including asymptotic results on both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.</description>

Abstract: We show that the flow approach of Duch [Duc21] can be adapted to prove local well-posedness for the generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. The key step is to extend the flow approach so that it can accommodate semi-linear equations involving smooth, non-polynomial, functions of the solution - this is accomplished by introducing coordinates for the flow built out of elementary differentials.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We consider the KPZ equation in $1$ spatial dimension with noise that is rougher than white by an exponent $\gamma&gt;1/4$. Under a weak coupling limit, formally removing the nonlinearity from the equation, we show using regularity structures that the renormalised solutions converge to a Gaussian limit that is different from the solution of the linear part of the equation. The regime of this effect has a nontrivial overlap with the subcritical regime $\gamma&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Convergence of Quadratically Regularized Linear Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear programs with quadratic regularization are attracting renewed interest due to their applications in optimal transport: unlike entropic regularization, the squared-norm penalty gives rise to sparse approximations of optimal transport couplings. It is well known that the solution of a quadratically regularized linear program over any polytope converges stationarily to the minimal-norm solution of the linear program when the regularization parameter tends to zero. However, that result is merely qualitative. Our main result quantifies the convergence by specifying the exact threshold for the regularization parameter, after which the regularized solution also solves the linear program. Moreover, we bound the suboptimality of the regularized solution before the threshold. These results are complemented by a convergence rate for the regime of large regularization. We apply our general results to the setting of optimal transport, where we shed light on how the threshold and suboptimality depend on the number of data points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive demonstration of recent results regarding the structures of the weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces. These spaces' definitions involve local and global weighted Lebesgue norms; in other words, the norms of these spaces are generated by positive sublinear operators and by weighted Lebesgue norms. The weighted Lebesgue spaces are the special cases of these spaces with a specific set of parameters.
  Our primary method of investigating these spaces will be the so-called discretization technique. Our technique will be the development of the approach initiated by K.G. Grosse-Erdmann, which allows us to obtain the characterization in previously unavailable situations, thereby addressing decades-old open problems.
  We investigate the relation (embeddings) between weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces. The characterization of these embeddings can be used to tackle the problems of characterizing pointwise multipliers between weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces, the characterizations of the associate spaces of Ces\`aro (Copson) function spaces, as well as the relations between local Morrey-type spaces.</description>

      <title>Functional tilings and the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coven and Meyerowitz formulated two conditions which have since been conjectured to characterize all finite sets that tile the integers by translation. By periodicity, this conjecture is reduced to sets which tile a finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_M$. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of this problem, where we replace sets with nonnegative functions $f,g$, such that $f(0)=g(0)=1$, $f\ast g=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Z}_M}$ is a functional tiling, and $f, g$ satisfy certain further natural properties associated with tilings. We show that the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions do not necessarily hold in such generality. Such examples of functional tilings carry the potential to lead to proper tiling counterexamples to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the spectral generalization of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem to smooth metric measure space. We show that if a complete non-compact weighted Riemannian manifold $(M,g,e^{-f}\,dvolg)$ of dimension $n\ge 2$ has at least two ends where $f$ is smooth and bounded. If there is some $N\in (0,\infty)$ and $\gamma&lt;\left(\frac{1}{(n-1)\left(1 + \frac{n-1}{N}\right)} + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)^{-1}$ such that $$\lambda_1(-\gamma \Delta_f+\operatorname{Ric}^N_f)\ge 0$$then $M$ splits isometrically as $\mathbb{R}\times X$ for some complete Riemannian manifold $X$ with $(\operatorname{Ric}_X)^N_f\ge 0$. The estimate can recover the spectral splitting result and its sharp constant $\frac{4}{n-1}$ in Antonelli-Pozzetta-Xu and and Catino--Mari--Mastrolia--Roncoroni.</description>
