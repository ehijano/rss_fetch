      <title>Heteroclinic connections between finite-amplitude periodic orbits emerging from a codimension two singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heteroclinic connections between two distinct hyperbolic periodic orbits in conservative systems are important in a wide range of applications. On the other hand, it is theoretically challenging to find large amplitude connections from scratch and compute them numerically. In this paper, we use a codimension two singularity, in a family of periodic orbits, as an organizing center for the emergence of heteroclinic connections. A normal form is derived whose unfolding produces two distinct finite amplitude periodic orbits with an explicit heteroclinic connection. We also construct heteroclinic connections far from the singularity by numerical continuation, using two numerical strategies: shooting and the core-farfield decomposition. A key geometric tool in the numerics is cylindrical foliations for the stable and unstable manifolds and their intersection. We introduce a new property of heteroclinic connections - the action - and show it is an invariant along foliations, it has a jump at a surface of section, and it appears in a central way in the normal form theory. We find that the difference in asymptotic phase between minus and plus infinity is also a key property. The theory is applied to the Swift-Hohenberg equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger with fourth order dispersion, and coupled Boussinesq equations from water waves, all of which have an energy and action conservation law.</description>

      <title>Instability of anchored spirals in geometric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate existence, stability, and instability of anchored rotating spiral waves in a model for geometric curve evolution. We find existence in a parameter regime limiting on a purely eikonal curve evolution. We study stability and instability theoretically, in the aforementioned limiting regime, and numerically. We find convective and absolute oscillatory instability, as well as saddle-node bifurcations. Our results in particular shed light on the instability of spiral waves in reaction-diffusion systems caused by an instability of wave trains against transverse modulations.</description>

      <title>On the proximal dynamics between integrable and non-integrable members of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries family of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distance between the solutions to the integrable Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and a broad class of non-integrable generalized KdV (gKdV) equations is estimated in appropriate Sobolev spaces. This family of equations includes, as special cases, the standard gKdV equation with power nonlinearities as well as weakly nonlinear perturbations of the KdV equation. For initial data and nonlinearity parameters of arbitrary size, we establish distance estimates based on a crucial size estimate for local gKdV solutions that grows linearly with the norm of the initial data. Consequently, these estimates predict that the dynamics of the gKdV and KdV equations remain close over long time intervals for initial amplitudes approaching unity, while providing an explicit rate of deviation for larger amplitudes. These theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations of one-soliton and two-soliton initial conditions, which show excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that in the case of power nonlinearities and large solitonic initial data, the deviation between the integrable and non-integrable dynamics can be drastically reduced by incorporating suitable rotation effects via a rescaled KdV equation. As a result, the integrable dynamics stemming from the rescaled KdV equation may persist within the gKdV family of equations over remarkably long timescales.</description>
