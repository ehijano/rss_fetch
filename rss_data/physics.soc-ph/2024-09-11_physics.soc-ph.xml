      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation: in particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude by discussing the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>

      <title>Random matching in balanced bipartite graphs: The (un)fairness of draw mechanisms used in sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The draw of some knockout tournaments requires finding a perfect matching in a balanced bipartite graph. The problem becomes challenging with draw constraints: the two field-proven procedures used in sports are known to be non-uniformly distributed (the feasible matchings are not equally likely), which may threaten fairness. We compare the biases of both mechanisms, each of them having two forms, for reasonable subsets of balanced bipartite graphs up to 16 nodes. A mechanism is found to dominate all others in the draw of quarterfinals under reasonable restrictions. The UEFA Champions League Round of 16 draw is verified to apply the best design among the four available options between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons. However, considerable scope remains to improve the performance of these randomisation procedures, especially because they tend to distort the probabilities in the same direction and roughly with the same magnitude.</description>

      <title>Math behind everyday life: "black days", their manifestation as traffic jams, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our daily lives, we encounter numerous independent events, each occurring with varying probabilities over time. This letter delves into the scientific background behind the inhomogeneous distribution of these events over time, often resulting in what we refer to as ``black days'', where multiple events seem to converge at once. In the first part of the work we performed an analysis involving $D$ independent periodic and random sequences of events. Using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique, we observed a clustering of event sequences on a two-dimensional manifold ${\cal M}$ at a certain large $D$. We interpret this clustering as a signature of ``black days'', which bears a clear resemblance to traffic jams in vehicle flow. In the second part of the work we examined in detail clustering patterns of independently distributed $N$ points within the corners of a $D$-dimensional cube when $1\ll N&lt;D$. Our findings revealed that a transition to a single-component cluster occurs at a critical dimensionality, $D_{cr}$, via a nearly third-order phase transition. Analyzing the spectral density, $\rho(\lambda)$, of the corresponding adjacency graph in the vicinity of the clustering transition we recover the singular ''Lifshitz tail'' behavior at the spectral boundary of $\rho(\lambda)$.</description>

      <title>Signatures of criticality in turning avalanches of schooling fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moving animal groups transmit information through propagating waves or behavioral cascades, exhibiting characteristics akin to systems near a critical point from statistical physics. Using data from freely swimming schooling fish in an experimental tank, we investigate spontaneous behavioral cascades involving turning avalanches, where large directional shifts propagate across the group. We analyze several avalanche metrics and provide a detailed picture of the dynamics associated to turning avalanches, employing tools from avalanche behavior in condensed matter physics and seismology. Our results identify power-law distributions and robust scale-free behaviour through data collapses and scaling relationships, confirming a necessary condition for criticality in fish schools. We explore the biological function of turning avalanches and link them to collective decision-making processes in selecting a new movement direction for the school. We report relevant boundary effects arising from interactions with the tank walls and influential roles of boundary individuals. Finally, spatial and temporal correlations in avalanches are explored using the concept of aftershocks from seismology, revealing clustering of avalanche events below a designated timescale and an Omori law with a faster decay rate than observed in earthquakes.</description>

      <title>A Carbon Aware Ant Colony System (CAACS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly crucial, we introduce a new Carbon-Aware Ant Colony System (CAACS) Algorithm that addresses the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) while minimizing carbon emissions. This novel approach leverages the natural efficiency of ant colony pheromone trails to find optimal routes, balancing both environmental and economic objectives. By integrating sustainability into transportation models, CAACS provides a powerful tool for real-world applications, including network design, delivery route planning, and commercial aircraft logistics. Our algorithm's unique bi-objective optimization advances the study of sustainable transportation solutions.</description>
