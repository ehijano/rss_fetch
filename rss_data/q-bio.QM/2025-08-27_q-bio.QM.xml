      <title>Adding a Storage Pool improves 3-PG Tree-ring Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree rings provide long-term records of tree growth and climate changes, which makes them ideal benchmarks for forest modeling. Tree-ring information has greatly improved the reliability of 3-PG, which is one of the most commonly used process-based forest growth models. Here we strengthen 3-PGs ability to simulate tree-ring width and carbon stable isotopes ({\delta}13C) by enhancing its descriptions of tree physiology. The major upgrade was adding a carbon storage pool for tree-ring formation using stored carbohydrates. We also incorporated previous modifications (replacing the age modifier with a height modifier) of 3-PG and tested their efficacy in improving tree-ring simulations. We ran the model based on two grand fir (Abies grandis) stands. The updated model greatly improved the simulations for both tree-ring widths and {\delta}13C. The results represent one of the best tree-ring {\delta}13C simulations, which accurately captured the amplitude in annual variations of {\delta}13C. The correlations (R2) between simulations and observations reached 0.50 and 0.73 at two stands respectively. The new model also greatly improved the simulations of raw tree-ring widths and detrended ring-widths index. Because of better descriptions of tree physiology and more accurate simulations of tree rings than the previous model version, the updated 3-PG should provide more reliable simulations than previous 3-PG versions when tree-ring information is used as benchmark in future studies.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional modeling of blood flow: A comprehensive yet concise review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) blood flow simulations are extensively used in cardiovascular research due to their computational efficiency and effectiveness in analyzing pulse wave dynamics. Despite their versatility and simplicity, there is a lack of a unified, step-by-step guide integrating theoretical derivations with practical implementation details. In this work, we summarize key components for comprehensive 1D blood flow simulations, including the derivation of reduced-order governing equations, the method of characteristics (Riemann invariants), a finite volume-based numerical scheme, boundary conditions (application of Riemann invariants for reflective/non-reflective and 3-element Windkessel outlet boundaries), junction treatments, verification of presented methodologies, and relevant practical applications. Additionally, we provide detailed step-by-step instructions for implementing the numerical scheme, applying boundary conditions, and treatment of junctions. By integrating rigorous theory with practical guidance for implementation, we seek to improve accessibility of 1D blood flow simulations. We anticipate that this guide will serve as a valuable resource and foundational reference for both novice and experienced researchers in cardiovascular modeling.</description>

      <title>Learning Explainable Imaging-Genetics Associations Related to a Neurological Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .</description>

      <title>Saccade crossing avoidance as a visual search strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although visual search appears largely random, several oculomotor biases exist such that the likelihoods of saccade directions and lengths depend on the previous scan path. Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the longer path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection framework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second viewings of "Where's Waldo"?, we report a new memory-dependent effect that also varies significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing avoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in the scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show this by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless approximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model with a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood fitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last $\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known forms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric probabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to reproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also quantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six images viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants with a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and shorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal, vertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that the avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and complements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoders for Low-$N$ Protein Function Prediction and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2 embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks. We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.</description>

      <title>DrugReasoner: Interpretable Drug Approval Prediction with a Reasoning-augmented Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments. While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval. DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores. DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set, respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Biologically Disentangled Multi-Omic Modeling Reveals Mechanistic Insights into Pan-Cancer Immunotherapy Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response (AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.</description>

      <title>Think before you fit: parameter identifiability, sensitivity and uncertainty in systems biology models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable predictions from systems biology models require knowing whether parameters can be estimated from available data, and with what certainty. Identifiability analysis reveals whether parameters are learnable in principle (structural identifiability) and in practice (practical identifiability). We introduce the core ideas using linear models, highlighting how experimental design and output sensitivity shape identifiability. In nonlinear models, identifiability can vary with parameter values, motivating global and simulation-based approaches. We summarise computational methods for assessing identifiability noting that weakly identifiable parameters can undermine predictions beyond the calibration dataset. Strategies to improve identifiability include measuring different outputs, refining model structure, and adding prior knowledge. Far from a technical afterthought, identifiability determines the limits of inference and prediction. Recognising and addressing identifiability is essential for building models that are not only well-fitted to data, but also capable of delivering predictions with robust, quantifiable uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Deep vectorised operators for pulsatile hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries from a steady-state prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular hemodynamic fields provide valuable medical decision markers for coronary artery disease. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the gold standard for accurate, non-invasive evaluation of these quantities in silico. In this work, we propose a time-efficient surrogate model, powered by machine learning, for the estimation of pulsatile hemodynamics based on steady-state priors. We introduce deep vectorised operators, a modelling framework for discretisation-independent learning on infinite-dimensional function spaces. The underlying neural architecture is a neural field conditioned on hemodynamic boundary conditions. Importantly, we show how relaxing the requirement of point-wise action to permutation-equivariance leads to a family of models that can be parametrised by message passing and self-attention layers. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 74 stenotic coronary arteries extracted from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with patient-specific pulsatile CFD simulations as ground truth. We show that our model produces accurate estimates of the pulsatile velocity and pressure (approximation disparity 0.368 $\pm$ 0.079) while being agnostic ($p &lt; 0.05$ in a one-way ANOVA test) to re-sampling of the source domain, i.e. discretisation-independent. This shows that deep vectorised operators are a powerful modelling tool for cardiovascular hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries and beyond.</description>

      <title>Evaluating DNA function understanding in genomic language models using evolutionarily implausible sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) hold promise for generating novel, functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology. However, realizing this potential requires models to go beyond evolutionary plausibility and understand how DNA sequence encodes gene expression and regulation. We introduce a benchmark called Nullsettes, which assesses how well models can predict in silico loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, in synthetic expression cassettes with little evolutionary precedent. Testing 12 state-of-the-art gLMs, we find that most fail to consistently detect these strong LOF mutations. All models show a sharp drop in predictive accuracy as the likelihood assigned to the original (nonmutant) sequence decreases, suggesting that gLMs rely heavily on pattern-matching to their evolutionary prior rather than on any mechanistic understanding of gene expression. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in how gLMs generalize to engineered, non-natural sequences, and underscore the need for benchmarks and modeling strategies that prioritize functional understanding.</description>

      <title>A Nonstandard Finite Difference Scheme for an SEIQR Epidemiological PDE Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Time-Resolved NMR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metabolic monitoring and reaction rate estimation using hyperpolarized NMR technology requires accurate quantitative analysis of multidimensional data scenarios. Currently, this analysis is often performed in a two-stage procedure, which is prone to errors in uncertainty propagation and estimation. We propose an approach derived from a Bayesian hierarchical model that intrinsically propagates uncertainties and operates on the full data to maximize the precision at minimal uncertainty. In an analytic treatment, we reduce the estimation procedure to a least-squares optimization problem which can be understood as an extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) approach for data scenarios with two predictors. We investigate the method's efficacy in two experiments with hyperpolarized metabolites recorded with conventional high-field NMR devices and a micronscale NMR setup using Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond for detection, respectively. In both examples, the new approach improves estimates compared to Fourier methods and proves operational advantages over a two-stage procedure employing VarPro. While the approach presented is motivated by NMR analysis, it is straightforwardly applicable to further estimation scenarios with similar data structure, such as time-resolved photospectroscopy.</description>
