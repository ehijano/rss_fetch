      <title>Market Beliefs about Open vs. Closed AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market expectations about AI's economic impact may influence interest rates. Previous work has shown that US bond yields decline around the release of a sample of mostly proprietary AI models (Andrews and Farboodi 2025). I extend this analysis to include also open weight AI models that can be freely used and modified. I find long-term bond yields shift in opposite directions following the introduction of open versus closed models. Patterns are similar for treasuries, corporate bonds, and TIPS. This suggests that the movement of bond yields around AI models may be a function of not only technological advances but also factors such as licensing. The different movements suggest that markets may anticipate openness to have important economic implications.</description>

      <title>Explicit Solution to a government debt reduction problem: a stochastic control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of optimal reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio in a stochastic control setting. The debt-to-GDP dynamics are modeled through a stochastic differential equation in which fiscal policy simultaneously affects both debt accumulation and GDP growth. A key feature of the framework is the introduction of a cost functional that captures the disutility of fiscal surpluses and the perceived benefit of fiscal deficits, thus incorporating the macroeconomic trade-off between tighten and expansionary policies. By applying the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach, we provide explicit solutions in the case of linear GDP response to the fiscal policies. We rigorously analyze threshold-type fiscal strategies in the case of linear impact of the fiscal policy and provide closed-form solutions for the associated value function in relevant regimes. A sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying key model parameters, confirming the robustness of our theoretical findings. The application to debt reduction highlights how fiscal costs and benefits influence optimal interventions, offering valuable insights into sustainable public debt management under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Lifecycle Estimator of Intergenerational Income Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lacking lifetime income data, most intergenerational mobility estimates are subject to lifecycle bias. Using long income series from Sweden and the US, we illustrate that standard correction methods struggle to account for one important property of income processes: children from affluent families experience faster income growth, even conditional on their own characteristics. We propose a lifecycle estimator that captures this pattern and performs well across different settings. We apply the estimator to study mobility trends, including for recent cohorts that could not be considered in prior work. Despite rising income inequality, intergenerational mobility remained largely stable in both countries.</description>

      <title>How social media creators shape mass politics: A field experiment during the 2024 US elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political apathy and skepticism of traditional authorities are increasingly common, but social media creators (SMCs) capture the public's attention. Yet whether these seemingly-frivolous actors shape political attitudes and behaviors remains largely unknown. Our pre-registered field experiment encouraged Americans aged 18-45 to start following five progressive-minded SMCs on Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube between August and December 2024. We varied recommendations to follow SMCs producing predominantly-political (PP), predominantly-apolitical (PA), or entirely non-political (NP) content, and cross-randomized financial incentives to follow assigned SMCs. Beyond markedly increasing consumption of assigned SMCs' content, biweekly quiz-based incentives increased overall social media use by 10% and made participants more politically knowledgeable. These incentives to follow PP or PA SMCs led participants to adopt more liberal policy positions and grand narratives around election time, while PP SMCs more strongly shaped partisan evaluations and vote choice. PA SMCs were seen as more informative and trustworthy, generating larger effects per video concerning politics. Participants assigned to follow NP SMCs instead became more conservative, consistent with left-leaning participants using social media more when right-leaning content was ascendant. These effects exceed the impacts of traditional campaign outreach and partisan media, demonstrating the importance of SMCs as opinion leaders in the attention economy as well as trust- and volume-based mechanisms of political persuasion.</description>

      <title>Can They Compete? Cost Competitiveness of Non-Light-Water Reactors for Heat and Power Supply in a Decarbonized European Energy System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent pledges to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050 suggest a "nuclear renaissance," bolstered by unconventional reactor concepts such as sodium-cooled fast reactors, high-temperature reactors, and molten salt reactors. These technologies claim to address the challenges of today's high-capacity light-water reactors, i.e., cost overruns, delays, and social acceptance, while also offering additional non-electrical applications. However, this analysis reveals that none of these concepts currently meet the prerequisites of affordability, competitiveness, or commercial availability. Our cost analysis reveals optimistic FOAK cost assumptions of 5,623 to 9,511 USD per kW, and NOAK cost projections as low as 1,476 USD per kW. At FOAK cost, the applied energy system model for Europe in 2040 includes no nuclear power capacity, and thus indicates that significant cost reductions would be required for these technologies to contribute to energy system decarbonization. In lower-cost scenarios, reactors capable of producing high and medium temperature heat compete with other technologies and dominate the system once costs fall below 5,000 USD per kW. Electricity shares reach current levels of approx. 20% once costs are reduced to 3,000 USD per kW or less We conclude that, for reactor capacities to increase significantly, a focus on certain technology lines and streamlined regulation in necessary. Further remaining technological challenges, e.g., new waste streams, must be resolved.</description>

      <title>Geographic Variation in Multigenerational Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using complete-count register data spanning three generations, we document spatial patterns in inter- and multi-generational mobility in Sweden. Across municipalities, grandfather-child correlations in education or earnings tend to be larger than the square of the parent-child correlations, suggesting that the latter understate status transmission in the long run. Yet, conventional parent-child correlations capture regional differences in long-run transmission and therefore remain useful for comparative purposes. We further find that the within-country association between mobility and income inequality (the "Great Gatsby Curve") is at least as strong in the multi- as in the inter-generational case. Interpreting those patterns through the lens of a latent factor model, we find that regional differences in mobility primarily reflect variation in the transmission of latent advantages, rather than in how those advantages translate into observed outcomes.</description>

      <title>Job insecurity, equilibrium determinacy and E-stability in a New Keynesian model with asymmetric information. Theory and simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Departing from the dominant approach focused on individual and meso-level determinants, this paper develops a macroeconomic formalization of job insecurity within a New Keynesian framework in which the standard IS-NKPC-Taylor rule block is augmented with labor-market frictions. The model features partially informed private agents who receive a noisy signal about economic fundamentals from a fully informed public sector. When monetary policy satisfies the Taylor principle, the equilibrium is unique and determinate. However, the release of news about current or future fundamentals can generate a "Paradox of Transparency" through general-equilibrium interactions between aggregate demand and monetary policy. When the Taylor principle is violated, belief-driven equilibria may emerge. Validation exercises based on the Simulated Method of Moments support the empirical plausibility of the model's key implications.</description>

      <title>What Is Your AI Agent Buying? Evaluation, Biases, Model Dependence, &amp; Emerging Implications for Agentic E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, AI agents can parse webpages or leverage APIs to view, evaluate and choose products. We investigate the behavior of AI agents using ACES, a provider-agnostic framework for auditing agent decision-making. We reveal that agents can exhibit choice homogeneity, often concentrating demand on a few ``modal'' products while ignoring others entirely. Yet, these preferences are unstable: model updates can drastically reshuffle market shares. Furthermore, randomized trials show that while agents have improved over time on simple tasks with a clearly identified best choice, they exhibit strong position biases -- varying across providers and model versions, and persisting even in text-only "headless" interfaces -- undermining any universal notion of a ``top'' rank. Agents also consistently penalize sponsored tags while rewarding platform endorsements, and sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews vary sharply across models. Finally, we demonstrate that sellers can respond: a seller-side agent making simple, query-conditional description tweaks can drive significant gains in market share. These findings reveal that agentic markets are volatile and fundamentally different from human-centric commerce, highlighting the need for continuous auditing and raising questions for platform design, seller strategy and regulation.</description>
