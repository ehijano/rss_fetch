      <title>Foundation Time-Series AI Model for Realized Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a popular paradigm for zero-shot multi-domain forecasting. These models are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including financial data. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of FMs, specifically the TimesFM model, for volatility forecasting, a core task in financial risk management. We first evaluate TimesFM in its pretrained (zero-shot) form, followed by our custom fine-tuning procedure based on incremental learning, and compare the resulting models against standard econometric benchmarks. While the pretrained model provides a reasonable baseline, our findings show that incremental fine-tuning, which allows the model to adapt to new financial return data over time, is essential for learning volatility patterns effectively. Fine-tuned variants not only improve forecast accuracy but also statistically outperform traditional models, as demonstrated through Diebold-Mariano and Giacomini-White tests. These results highlight the potential of foundation models as scalable and adaptive tools for financial forecasting-capable of delivering strong performance in dynamic market environments when paired with targeted fine-tuning strategies.</description>

      <title>Tail-GAN: Learning to Simulate Tail Risk Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of loss distributions for dynamic portfolios requires the simulation of scenarios representing realistic joint dynamics of their components. We propose a novel data-driven approach for simulating realistic, high-dimensional multi-asset scenarios, focusing on accurately representing tail risk for a class of static and dynamic trading strategies. We exploit the joint elicitability property of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) to design a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that learns to simulate price scenarios preserving these tail risk features. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on synthetic and market data sets through detailed numerical experiments. In contrast to previously proposed data-driven scenario generators, our proposed method correctly captures tail risk for a broad class of trading strategies and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. In addition, combining our method with principal component analysis of the input data enhances its scalability to large-dimensional multi-asset time series, setting our framework apart from the univariate settings commonly considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>Sample Average Approximation for Portfolio Optimization under CVaR constraint in an (re)insurance context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider optimal allocation problems with Conditional Value-At-Risk (CVaR) constraint. We prove, under very mild assumptions, the convergence of the Sample Average Approximation method (SAA) applied to this problem, and we also exhibit a convergence rate and discuss the uniqueness of the solution. These results give (re)insurers a practical solution to portfolio optimization under market regulatory constraints, i.e. a certain level of risk.</description>
