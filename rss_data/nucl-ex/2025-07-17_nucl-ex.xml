      <title>Measurement of photo- and radio-luminescence of thin ThF4 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted measurements on the photo- and radio-luminescence of thin ThF$_4$ films in both the UV and visible ranges. In the UV range, we found that both luminescences are at a similar level as the internal dark counting noise of the photo-multiplier-tube (PMT). Our results suggest that thin ThF$_4$ crystals could be used as a target for the search for $^{229m}$Th and as a medium for the future nuclear clock. The measurements indicate that using a small and thin ThF$_4$ film can reduce background noise while maintaining the signal at the same level, achieved by increasing the $^{229}$Th enrichment. Our developed apparatus is now ready for direct measurements of $^{229m}$Th excitation and decay in ThF$_4$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin distributions in multinucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent covariant density functional theory (TD-CDFT) combined with angular momentum projection is developed and applied to study multinucleon transfer (MNT) reactions, with a focus on the intrinsic angular momentum distributions of the final fragments. Using the illustrative reaction $^{40}$Ca + $^{208}$Pb across a range of impact parameters, we find that the MNT process generates broad distributions of intrinsic spins. These distributions arise from the conversion of relative orbital angular momentum into intrinsic spin due to frictional interactions between the colliding nuclei. Additionally, mutual information (entanglement Shannon entropy) is employed to analyze correlations between the intrinsic spins of the fragments.</description>

      <title>M1 dipole strength from projected generator coordinate method calculations in the sd-shell valence space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy enhancement observed in the deexcitation $\gamma$-ray strength functions, attributed to magnetic dipole (M1) radiations, has spurred theoretical efforts to improve on its description. Among the most widely used approaches are the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) and its extensions. However, these methods often struggle to reproduce the correct behavior of the M1 strength at the lowest $\gamma$ energies. An alternative framework, the projected generator coordinate method (PGCM), offers significant advantages over QRPA by restoring broken symmetries and incorporating both vibrational and rotational dynamics within a unified description. Due to these features, PGCM has been proposed as a promising tool to study the low-energy M1 strength function in atomic nuclei. However, comprehensive investigations employing this method are lacking. The PGCM is presently used within the frame of sd-shell valence space calculations based on the USDB shell-model interaction to benchmark its performance against the solutions obtained via exact diagonalization. The reliability of two different sets of generator coordinates in the PGCM calculations is gauged using ${}^{24}$Mg as a test case. The ability of the PGCM to reproduce results from exact diagonalization in the sd valence space is demonstrated for $1^{+}$ states and M1 transitions. Future work will need to assess whether the proposed method can be applied systematically and extended to large-scale calculations while maintaining a reasonable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Surface and chemical effects on $^{199}$Hg spin polarization relaxation in optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin magnetometry using optically pumped $^{199}$Hg has been successfully used in many fundamental physics experiments. A serious problem that has not been resolved is the instability of the $^{199}$Hg spin relaxation rate in atomic vapor cells under irradiation with 254 nm Hg resonance light. In this paper, previously obtained data are re-analyzed or analyzed for the first time. The effects of impurities of H$_2$ and O$_2$ are elucidated, and possible ways to stabilize cells are discussed. Surface states originating from the an der Waals interaction of \hg with fused silica are analyzed and shown to be critical to understanding relaxation mechanisms. A discussion of the possible use of a mixture of N$_2$O and other gases is presented.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of quarkonia in vortical quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin alignment of $J/\psi$ with respect to event plane in relativistic heavy ion collisions exhibits a significant signal. We propose a possible mechanism for spin alignment through spin dependent dissociation of quarkonia in a vortical quark-gluon plasma. The spin dependent dissociation is realized through inelastic scattering between constituents of quarkonium and those of quark-gluon plasma polarized by the vorticity. The spin dependent dissociation rate is found to depend on the directions of vorticity, quantization axis, and quark momentum. We implement our results in a dissociation dominated evolution model for quarkonia in the Bjorken flow, finding the spin $0$ state is slightly suppressed compared to the average of the other two, which is consistent with the sign found in experiments. We also find absence of logarithmic enhancement in binding energy in the vortical correction to dissociation rate, which is understood from the requirement that a spin dependent dissociation can only come from quark coupling to a pair of chromomagnetic and chromoelectric field.</description>

      <title>Puzzling $B(E2;0^+\rightarrow 2^+)$ strength in the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the $E2$ transition rate from the ground state to the first 2$^+$ excited state of the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca show an unusual pattern when compared to its isotopic neighbor $^{38}$Ca: despite having a higher $E_x(2_1^+)$ excitation energy, the $B(E2; 0^+_1\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ rate in $^{36}$Ca is larger. The question that naturally arises is to what extent this observation can be attributed to the unbound character of the $2^+_1$ state. To understand the influence of the continuum space on the low-energy properties of $^{36}$Ca, we carried out Gamow shell model calculations that can account for the continuum coupling effects associated with the occupation of unbound $fp$ shells. We found that in the threshold $2^+$ state, $^{36}$Ca is spatially diffused, which impacts the observed $B(E2)$ trend.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of recent $\Xi$-nuclear bound state signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: J-PARC E05 reported recently a hint of a $\Xi^--{^{11}{\rm B}}$ nuclear state in the ${^{12}}{\rm C}(K^-,K^+){^{12}_{\Xi}}{\rm Be}$ spectrum, bound by $B_{\Xi^-}=8.9\pm 1.4 {^{+3.8}_{-3.1}}$ MeV. Using a density-dependent $\Xi$-nuclear optical potential $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$ we explore to what extent a $\Xi^-_{1s}$ assignment of this nuclear state is compatible with $\Xi^-_{1s}$ and $\Xi^-_{1p}$ nuclear-state interpretations of $\Xi^-$ capture events in light emulsion-nuclei experiments. We find that the only acceptable $\Xi^-_{1s}$ assignment at present, barring an abnormally strong repulsive $\rho^2$ component of $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$, is that for the $\Xi^--{^{11}{\rm B}}$ signal. This finding supports reassigning $\Xi^-$ capture events in $^{14}$N, originally assigned as $\Xi^-_{1s}-{^{14}{\rm N}}$ nuclear states, to $\Xi^0_{1p}-{^{14}{\rm C}}$ nuclear states. The depth of $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$ at nuclear-matter density $\rho_0=0.17$ fm$^{-3}$ is then $-V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho_0)\sim 21$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric muon-antimuon emission from $Z^0$ decays: a clear magnetometer in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a very clear signal of the presence of a strong magnetic field during the early stage of a high-energy heavy-ion collision is provided by the decay of the $Z^0$ into dimuon pairs. We find that the process is highly anisotropic, producing pairs mainly out of plane, as signaled by a negative value of $v_2$, and leads to an antimuon transverse momentum distribution which peaks at a higher value of the transverse momentum compared to the peak of the muon transverse momentum distribution. We also show that the process does not produce a significant distortion of the $Z^0$ spectral function. The signal can be identified by comparing the dimuon-invariant mass and the individual muon and antimuon spectra produced in semicentral heavy-ion collisions with the corresponding scaled spectra produced in p+p collisions at the $Z^0$ peak.</description>
