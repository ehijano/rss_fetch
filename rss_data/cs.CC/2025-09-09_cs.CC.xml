      <title>A General Framework for Low Soundness Homomorphism Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework to design and analyze algorithms for the problem of testing homomorphisms between finite groups in the low-soundness regime.
  In this regime, we give the first constant-query tests for various families of groups. These include tests for: (i) homomorphisms between arbitrary cyclic groups, (ii) homomorphisms between any finite group and $\mathbb{Z}_p$, (iii) automorphisms of dihedral and symmetric groups, (iv) inner automorphisms of non-abelian finite simple groups and extraspecial groups, and (v) testing linear characters of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and finite-dimensional Lie algebras over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also recover the result of Kiwi [TCS'03] for testing homomorphisms between $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$.
  Prior to this work, such tests were only known for abelian groups with a constant maximal order (such as $\mathbb{F}_q^n$). No tests were known for non-abelian groups.
  As an additional corollary, our framework gives combinatorial list decoding bounds for cyclic groups with list size dependence of $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (for agreement parameter $\varepsilon$). This improves upon the currently best-known bound of $O(\varepsilon^{-105})$ due to Dinur, Grigorescu, Kopparty, and Sudan [STOC'08], and Guo and Sudan [RANDOM'14].</description>

      <title>Linear Matroid Intersection is in Catalytic Logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06435v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear matroid intersection is an important problem in combinatorial optimization. Given two linear matroids over the same ground set, the linear matroid intersection problem asks you to find a common independent set of maximum size. The deep interest in linear matroid intersection is due to the fact that it generalises many classical problems in theoretical computer science, such as bipartite matching, edge disjoint spanning trees, rainbow spanning tree, and many more.
  We study this problem in the model of catalytic computation: space-bounded machines are granted access to \textit{catalytic space}, which is additional working memory that is full with arbitrary data that must be preserved at the end of its computation.
  Although linear matroid intersection has had a polynomial time algorithm for over 50 years, it remains an important open problem to show that linear matroid intersection belongs to any well studied subclass of $\mathsf{P}$. We address this problem for the class catalytic logspace ($\mathsf{CL}$) with a polynomial time bound ($\mathsf{CLP}$).
  Recently, Agarwala and Mertz (2025) showed that bipartite maximum matching can be computed in the class $\mathsf{CLP}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$. This was the first subclass of $\mathsf{P}$ shown to contain bipartite matching, and additionally the first problem outside $\mathsf{TC}^1$ shown to be contained in $\mathsf{CL}$. We significantly improve the result of Agarwala and Mertz by showing that linear matroid intersection can be computed in $\mathsf{CLP}$.</description>

      <title>The Parameter Report: An Orientation Guide for Data-Driven Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strength of parameterized algorithmics is that each problem can be parameterized by an essentially inexhaustible set of parameters. Usually, the choice of the considered parameter is informed by the theoretical relations between parameters with the general goal of achieving FPT-algorithms for smaller and smaller parameters. However, the FPT-algorithms for smaller parameters usually have higher running times and it is unclear whether the decrease in the parameter value or the increase in the running time bound dominates in real-world data. This question cannot be answered from purely theoretical considerations and any answer requires knowledge on typical parameter values.
  To provide a data-driven guideline for parameterized complexity studies of graph problems, we present the first comprehensive comparison of parameter values for a set of benchmark graphs originating from real-world applications. Our study covers degree-related parameters, such as maximum degree or degeneracy, neighborhood-based parameters such as neighborhood diversity and modular-width, modulator-based parameters such as vertex cover number and feedback vertex set number, and the treewidth of the graphs.
  Our results may help assess the significance of FPT-running time bounds on the solvability of real-world instances. For example, the vertex cover number $vc$ of $n$-vertex graphs is often only slightly below $n/2$. Thus, a running time bound of $O(2^{vc})$ is only slightly better than a running time bound of $O(1.4^{n})$. In contrast, the treewidth $tw$ is almost always below $n/3$ and often close to $n/9$, making a running time of $O(2^{tw})$ much more practical on real-world instances.
  We make our implementation and full experimental data openly available. In particular, this provides the first implementations for several graph parameters such as 4-path vertex cover number and vertex integrity.</description>

      <title>On the Bit Size of Sum-of-Squares Proofs for Symmetric Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy is a powerful framework for polynomial optimization and proof complexity, offering tight semidefinite relaxations that capture many classical algorithms. Despite its broad applicability, several works have revealed fundamental limitations to SoS automatability. (i) While low-degree SoS proofs are often desirable for tractability, recent works have revealed they may require coefficients of prohibitively large bit size, rendering them computationally infeasible. (ii) Prior works have shown that SoS proofs for seemingly easy problems require high-degree. In particular, this phenomenon also arises in highly symmetric problems. Instances of symmetric problems-particularly those with a small number of constraints-have repeatedly served as benchmarks for establishing high-degree lower bounds in the SoS hierarchy. It has remained unclear whether symmetry can also lead to large bit sizes in SoS proofs, potentially making low-degree proofs computationally infeasible even in symmetric settings.
  In this work, we resolve this question by proving that symmetry alone does not lead to large bit size SoS proofs. Focusing on symmetric Archimedean instances, we show that low-degree SoS proofs for such systems admit compact, low bit size representations. Together, these results provide a conceptual separation between two sources of SoS hardness-degree and bit size-by showing they do not necessarily align, even in highly symmetric instances. This insight guides future work on automatability and lower bounds: symmetry may necessitate high-degree proofs, but it does not by itself force large coefficients.</description>

      <title>Fixed Parameter Tractable Linearizability Monitoring for Stack, Queue and Anagram Agnostic Data Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verifying linearizability of concurrent data structures is NP-hard, even for simple types. We present fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for monitoring stacks, queues, and anagram-agnostic data types (AADTs), parameterized by the maximum concurrency. Our approach leverages frontier graphs and partition states to bound the search space. For AADTs, equivalence of linearizations enables monitoring in log-linear time. For stacks, we introduce a grammar-based method with a sub-cubic reduction to matrix multiplication, and for queues, a split-sequence transition system supporting efficient dynamic programming. These results unify tractability guarantees for both order-sensitive and anagram-agnostic data types under bounded concurrency.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*}
  \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*}
  \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*}
  In this work, we show that \begin{equation*}
  F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$.
  Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</description>

      <title>Another generalization of Hadamard test: Optimal sample complexities for learning functions on the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05710v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating properties of unknown unitary operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. While full unitary tomography requires a number of samples to the unknown unitary scaling linearly with the dimension (implying exponentially with the number of qubits), estimating specific functions of a unitary can be significantly more efficient. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the sample-efficient estimation of arbitrary square integrable functions $f: \mathbf{U}(d) \to \mathbb{C}$, using only access to the controlled-unitary operation. We first provide a tight characterization of the optimal sample complexity when the accuracy is measured by the averaged bias over the unitary $\mathbf{U}(d)$. We then construct a sample-efficient estimation algorithm that becomes optimal under the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning criterion for various classes of functions.
  Applications include optimal estimation of matrix elements of irreducible representations, the trace, determinant, and general polynomial functions on $\mathbf{U}(d)$. Our technique generalize the Hadamard test and leverage tools from representation theory, yielding both lower and upper bound on sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Graph Packing Problems Parameterized by Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $H$-Packing is the problem of finding a maximum number of vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ in a given graph $G$. $H$-Partition is the special case of finding a set of vertex-disjoint copies that cover each vertex of $G$ exactly once. Our goal is to study these problems and some generalizations on bounded-treewidth graphs. The case of $H$ being a triangle is well understood: given a tree decomposition of $G$ having treewidth $tw$, the $K_3$-Packing problem can be solved in time $2^{tw} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, while Lokshtanov et al.~[{\it ACM Transactions on Algorithms} 2018] showed, under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH), that there is no $(2-\epsilon)^{tw}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ even for $K_3$-Partition. Similar results can be obtained for any other clique $K_d$ for $d\ge 3$. We provide generalizations in two directions:
  - We consider a generalization of the problem where every vertex can be used at most $c$ times for some $c\ge 1$. When $H$ is any clique $K_d$ with $d\ge 3$, then we give upper and lower bounds showing that the optimal running time increases to $(c+1)^{tw}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. We consider two variants depending on whether a copy of $H$ can be used multiple times in the packing.
  - If $H$ is not a clique, then the dependence of the running time on treewidth may not be even single exponential. Specifically, we show that if $H$ is any fixed graph where not every 2-connected component is a clique, then there is no $2^{o({tw}\log {tw})}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for \textsc{$H$-Partition}, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH).</description>

      <title>Efficient Catalytic Graph Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give fast, simple, and implementable catalytic logspace algorithms for two fundamental graph problems.
  First, a randomized catalytic algorithm for $s\to t$ connectivity running in $\widetilde{O}(nm)$ time, and a deterministic catalytic algorithm for the same running in $\widetilde{O}(n^3 m)$ time. The former algorithm is the first algorithmic use of randomization in $\mathsf{CL}$. The algorithm uses one register per vertex and repeatedly ``pushes'' values along the edges in the graph.
  Second, a deterministic catalytic algorithm for simulating random walks which in $\widetilde{O}( m T^2 / \varepsilon )$ time estimates the probability a $T$-step random walk ends at a given vertex within $\varepsilon$ additive error. The algorithm uses one register for each vertex and increments it at each visit to ensure repeated visits follow different outgoing edges.
  Prior catalytic algorithms for both problems did not have explicit runtime bounds beyond being polynomial in $n$.</description>

      <title>Slice rank and partition rank of the determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laplace expansion expresses the $n \times n$ determinant $\det_n$ as a sum of $n$ products. Do shorter expansions exist? In this paper we:
  - Fully determine the slice rank decompositions of $\det_n$ (where each product must contain a linear factor): In this case, we show that $n$ summands are necessary, and moreover, the only such expansions with $n$ summands are equivalent (in a precise sense) to the Laplace expansion. 
  - Prove a logarithmic lower bound for the partition rank of $\det_n$ (where each product is of multilinear forms): In this case, we show that at least $\log_2(n)+1$ summands are needed. We also explain why existing techniques fail to yield any nontrivial lower bound, and why our new method cannot give a super-logarithmic lower bound.
  - Separate partition rank from slice rank for $\det_n$: we find a quadratic expansion for $\det_4$, over any field, with fewer summands than the Laplace expansion. This construction is related to a well-known example of Green-Tao and Lovett-Meshulam-Samorodnitsky disproving the naive version of the Gowers Inverse conjecture over small fields.
  An important motivation for these questions comes from the challenge of separating structure and randomness for tensors. On the one hand, we show that the random construction fails to separate: for a random tensor of partition rank $r$, the analytic rank is $r-o(1)$ with high probability. On the other hand, our results imply that the determinant yields the first asymptotic separation between partition rank and analytic rank of $d$-tensors, with their ratio tending to infinity with $d$.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Recovery Reductions, Conjectures, and Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and initiate the study of a new model of reductions called the random noise model. In this model, the truth table $T_f$ of the function $f$ is corrupted on a randomly chosen $\delta$-fraction of instances. A randomized algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\left(t, \delta, 1-\varepsilon\right)$-recovery reduction for $f$ if:
  1. With probability $1-\varepsilon$ over the choice of $\delta$-fraction corruptions, given access to the corrupted truth table, the algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ computes $f(\phi)$ correctly with probability at least $2/3$ on every input $\phi$.
  2. The algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ runs in time $O(t)$.
  This model, a natural relaxation of average-case complexity, has practical motivations and is mathematically interesting.
  Pointing towards this, we show the existence of robust deterministic polynomial-time recovery reductions with optimal parameters up to polynomial factors (that is, deterministic $\left( poly(n), 0.5 - 1/poly(n), 1-e^{-\Omega(poly(n))} \right)$-recovery reductions) for a large function class SLNP$^S$ containing many of the canonical NP-complete problems - SAT, $k$SAT, $k$CSP, CLIQUE and more. As a corollary, we obtain that the barrier of Bogdanov and Trevisan (2006) for non-adaptive worst-case to average-case reductions does not apply to our mild non-adaptive relaxation.
  Furthermore, we establish recovery reductions with optimal parameters for Orthogonal Vectors and Parity $k$-Clique problems. These problems exhibit structural similarities to NP-complete problems, with Orthogonal Vectors admitting a $2^{0.5n}$-time reduction from $k$SAT on $n$ variables; and Parity $k$-Clique a subexponential-time reduction from 3SAT.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a constant $k$ such that Buss's intuitionistic theory $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$ does not prove that SAT requires co-nondeterministic circuits of size at least $n^k$. To our knowledge, this is the first unconditional unprovability result in bounded arithmetic in the context of worst-case fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds. We complement this result by showing that the upper bound $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq \mathsf{coNSIZE}[n^k]$ is unprovable in $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$.

In order to establish our main result, we obtain new unconditional lower bounds against refuters that might be of independent interest. In particular, we show that there is no efficient refuter for the lower bound $\mathsf{NP} \nsubseteq \mathsf{i.o.}\text{-}\mathsf{coNP}/\mathsf{poly}$, addressing in part a question raised by Atserias (2006).</description>
