      <title>Anomalously strong polarization dependence of the intensity of magnetically-induced atomic transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the optical field polarization on the spectrum of magnetically-induced transitions, a class of transitions forbidden at zero magnetic field, is studied with a weak-probe sub-Doppler technique. The high spectral resolution of the technique combined with the simplicity in interpreting the observed spectra\EK{,} allows to follow the behavior of individual transitions as a function of the magnetic field amplitude. We observe only one intense transition (out of $2F_g+1$) in the case of linear ($\pi$) polarization in the $F_g\rightarrow F_g+2$ manifolds of $^{85}$Rb, $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs for fields above a few hundreds of gauss. We show that this behavior is in agreement with a model based on the diagonalization of the Zeeman Hamiltonian matrix. With the rapid development of micro-machined vapor-cell-based sensors these results will be of use to magnetometers operating above Earth field, wide-range laser frequency stabilization systems and atomic Faraday filters.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in Selective Reflection Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated electromagnetically induced transparency in the spectrum of selective reflection at the interface of Rb atom vapors and a dielectric nanocell window. A nanocell with atomic vapor column thicknesses ranging from 150 to 1200 nm, as well as a 50~$\mu$m thickness microcell were used. We have compared electromagnetically induced transparency observed for the cases of the selective reflection and transmission. It was demonstrated that for the thicknesses of below $\leq 1000$ nm selective reflection technique is more favorable. In contrast, for wider cells and microcells, using transmitted radiation as probe field is more effective.</description>

      <title>Optical Tweezer Arrays of Erbium Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first successful trapping of single erbium atoms in an array of optical tweezers. Using a single narrow-line optical transition, we achieve deep cooling for direct tweezer loading, pairwise ejection, and continous imaging without additional recoil suppression techniques. Our tweezer wavelength choice enables us to reach the magic trapping condition by tuning the ellipticity of the trapping light. Additionally, we implement an ultrafast high-fidelity fluorescence imaging scheme using a broad transition, allowing time-resolved study of the tweezer population dynamics from many to single atoms during light-assisted collisions. In particular, we extract a pair-ejection rate that qualitatively agrees with the semiclassical predictions by the Gallagher-Pritchard model. This work represents a promising starting point for the exploration of erbium as a powerful resource for quantum simulation in optical tweezers.</description>

      <title>Proposal for the generation of continuous-wave vacuum ultraviolet laser light for Th-229 isomer precision spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to generate continuous-wave vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light at 148.4 nm using four-wave mixing in cadmium vapor for precision spectroscopy of the Th-229 isomer transition. Due to the large transition matrix elements of cadmium, the readily accessible wavelengths for the incident laser beams, and the high coherence of the four-wave mixing process, over 30 $\mu$W of VUV power can be generated with a narrow linewidth. This development paves the way for coherently driving the Th-229 isomer transition and developing the nuclear optical clock.</description>

Abstract: We respond to the recent comment in Optics Communications by Kayn Forbes on our recent Optics Communications article and we maintain that, contrary to what Forbes claims, substantial superchirality exists as a property of the $m\geq 1$ higher order Poincare modes. Forbes arguments are based on misconceptions and analytical errors, leading to erroneous results and unjustified criticism.</description>

      <title>A photonic quantum engine driven by superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance of nano- and micro-scale heat engines can be improved with a help from quantum mechanical phenomena. Recently, heat reservoirs with quantum coherence have been proposed to enhance engine performance beyond the Carnot limit even with a single reservoir. However, no physical realizations have been achieved so far. Here, we report the first proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a photonic quantum engine driven by superradiance employing a single heat reservoir composed of atoms and photonic vacuum. Reservoir atoms prepared in a quantum coherent superposition state underwent superradiance while traversing the cavity. This led to about 40-fold increase of the effective engine temperature, resulting in a near-unity engine efficiency. Moreover, the observed engine output power grew quadratically with respect to the atomic injection rate. Our work can be utilized in quantum mechanical heat transfer as well as in boosting engine powers, opening a pathway to development of photomechanical devices that run on quantum coherence embedded in heat baths.</description>

      <title>Competing excitation quenching and charge exchange in ultracold Li-Ba$^+$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid atom-ion systems are a rich and powerful platform for studying chemical reactions, as they feature both excellent control over the electronic state preparation and readout as well as a versatile tunability over the scattering energy, ranging from the few-partial wave regime to the quantum regime. In this work, we make use of these excellent control knobs, and present a joint experimental and theoretical study of the collisions of a single $^{138}$Ba$^+$ ion prepared in the $5d\,^2D_{3/2,5/2}$ metastable states with a ground state $^6$Li gas near quantum degeneracy. We show that in contrast to previously reported atom-ion mixtures, several non-radiative processes, including charge exchange, excitation exchange and quenching, compete with each other due to the inherent complexity of the ion-atom molecular structure. We present a full quantum model based on high-level electronic structure calculations involving spin-orbit couplings. Results are in excellent agreement with observations, highlighting the strong coupling between the internal angular momenta and the mechanical rotation of the colliding pair, which is relevant in any other hybrid system composed of an alkali-metal atom and an alkaline-earth ion.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Floquet dynamics in absorption spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers provide a powerful tool for measuring physical constants and testifying fundamental physics with unprecedented precision. Conventional atom interferometry focuses on the phase difference between two paths and utilizes matter waves with fixed coherence. Here, we report on realizing a Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometer of coherent matter waves dressed by a moving optical lattice in the gravity direction, and explore the resulting interference along multiple paths with tunable coherence. We investigate spatial correlations of atoms both within the lattice and between two arms by interferometry, and observe the emerging multiple interference peaks owing to the long-range coherence nature of the Bose-Einstein condensate. Our findings agree well with theoretical simulations, paving the way for high-precision interferometry with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic polarizability of Dy at 532 nm on the intercombination transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report experimental measurements of the dynamical polarizability of dysprosium, at a wavelength of 532 nm. We measure all three components (scalar, vector, tensor) of the anisotropic polarizability for the ground and the excited manifolds of the intercombination transition of Dy at 626 nm. The apparatus on which the measurements are performed is first presented. We obtain with this setup imaging of single Dy atoms with fidelity above 99 % and losses below 2.5 % induced by imaging. We then describe the methods used to extract the polarizability. In particular, we combine a measurement of trap frequency and trap depth on single atoms in optical tweezers, allowing us to obtain a measurement of the ground state polarizability free of errors in trap waist calibration. The obtained values give a magic condition between two Zeeman states in the ground and excited manifolds, which was used to image single atoms in optical tweezer arrays. The scalar polarizability of the ground state is in disagreement with theoretical expectations, calling for future investigations to resolve the discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Observation of full contrast icosahedral Bose-Einstein statistics in laser desorbed, buffer gas cooled C$_{60}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum mechanical nature of spherical top molecules is particularly evident at low angular momentum quantum number J. Using infrared spectroscopy on the 8.4$\mu$m rovibrational band of buffer gas cooled $^{12}$C$_{60}$, we observe the hitherto unseen R(J = 0 - 29) rotational progression, including the complete disappearance of certain transitions due to the molecule's perfect icosahedral symmetry and identical bosonic nuclei. The observation of extremely weak C$_{60}$ absorption is facilitated by a laser desorption C$_{60}$ vapor source, which transfers 1000-fold less heat to the cryogenic buffer gas cell than a traditional oven source. This technique paves the way to cooling C$_{60}$ and other large gas phase molecules to much lower temperatures, providing continued advances for spectral resolution and sensitivity.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurement of the atomic mass of $^{84}$Sr and implications to isotope shift studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absolute mass of $^{84}$Sr was determined using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer. A more precise value for the mass of $^{84}$Sr is essential for providing potential indications of physics beyond the Standard Model through high-precision isotope shift measurements of Sr atomic transition frequencies. The mass excess of $^{84}$Sr was refined to be -80649.229(37) keV/c$^2$ from high-precision cyclotron-frequency-ratio measurements with a relative precision of 4.8$\times$10$^{-10}$. The obtained mass-excess value is in agreement with the adopted value in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020, but is 30 times more precise. With this new value, we confirm the previously observed nonlinearity in the study of the isotope shift of strontium. Moreover, the double-beta ($2\beta^{+}$) decay $Q$ value of $^{84}$Sr was directly determined to be 1790.115(37) keV, and the precision was improved by a factor of 30.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of 1D Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both experimentally and theoretically. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behavior of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive single-ion electrometry in a magnetic field gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperfine energy levels in trapped ions offer long-lived spin states. In addition, the motion of these charged particles couples strongly to external electric field perturbations. These characteristics make trapped ions attractive platforms for the quantum sensing of electric fields. However, the spin states do not exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling to electric fields. This limits the achievable sensitivities. Here, we amplify the coupling between electric field perturbations and the spin states by using a static magnetic field gradient. Displacements of the trapped ion resulting from the forces experienced by an applied external electric field perturbation are thereby mapped to an instantaneous change in the energy level splitting of the internal spin states. This gradient mediated coupling of the electric field to the spin enables the use of a range of well-established magnetometry protocols for electrometry. Using our quantum sensor, we demonstrate AC sensitivities of $\mathrm{S^{AC}_{min}=960(10)\times 10^{-6}~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ at a signal frequency of $\omega_{\epsilon}/2\pi=5.82~\mathrm{Hz}$, and DC sensitivities of $\mathrm{S^{DC}_{min}=1.97(3)\times 10^{-3} ~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ with a Hahn-echo type sensing sequence. We also employ a rotating frame relaxometry technique, with which our quantum sensor can be utilised as an electric field noise spectrum analyser. We measure electric field signals down to a noise floor of $\mathrm{S_{E}(\omega)=6.2(5)\times 10^{-12}~V^2 m^{-2}Hz^{-1}}$ at a frequency of $\mathrm{30.0(3)~kHz}$. We therefore demonstrate unprecedented electric field sensitivities for the measurement of both DC signals and AC signals across a frequency range of sub-Hz to $\sim\mathrm{500~kHz}$. Finally, we describe a set of hardware modifications that are capable of achieving a further improvement in sensitivity by up to six orders of magnitude.</description>
