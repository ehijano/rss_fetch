      <title>The adelic closure of triangle groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by questions arising from billiard trajectories in the regular $n$-gon, McMullen defined a pair of functions $\kappa$ and $\delta$ on the cusps $c$ of the corresponding triangle group $\Delta_n$ inside $\mathrm{SL}_2({\mathcal{O}})$, where ${\mathcal{O}} = \mathbf{Z}[\zeta_n+ \zeta^{-1}_n]$. McMullen asks for which $n$ these functions are congruence, that is, when they only depend on the image of the cusp $c \in \mathbf{P}^1(\mathcal{O})$ in $\mathbf{P}^1(\mathcal{O}/d)$ for some integer $d$. In this note, we answer McMullen's questions. We obtain our results by computing the exact closure of $\Delta_n \subset \mathrm{SL}_2({\mathcal{O}})$ inside $\mathrm{SL}_2(\widehat{{\mathcal{O}}})$, where $\widehat{{\mathcal{O}}}$ is the profinite completion of ${\mathcal{O}}$.</description>

      <title>On the frequency of primes preserving dynamical irreducibility of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards a well-known open question in arithmetic dynamics, L. M\'erai, A. Ostafe and I. E. Shparlinski (2023), have shown, for a class of polynomials $f \in \mathbb Z[X]$, which in particular includes all quadratic polynomials, that, under some natural conditions (necessary for quadratic polynomials), the set of primes $p$, such that all iterations of $f$ are irreducible modulo $p$, is of relative density zero, with an explicit estimate on the rate of decay. This result relies on some bounds on character sums via the Brun sieve. Here we use the Selberg sieve and in some cases obtain a substantial quantitative improvement.</description>

      <title>Global Galois Symbols on E x E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let E be an elliptic curve over a number field F, A the abelian surface E x E, and T_F(A) the F-rational albanese kernel of A, which is a subgroup of the degree zero part of Chow group of zero cycles on A modulo rational equivalence. The first result is that for all but a finite number of primes p where E has ordinary reduction, the image of T_F(A)/p in the Galois cohomology group H^2(F, sym^2(E[p])) is zero; here E[p] denotes as usual the Galois module of p-division points on E. The second result is that for any prime p where E has good ordinary reduction, there is a finite extension K of F, depending on p and E, such that T_K(A)/p is non-zero.
  Much of this work was joint with Jacob Murre, and the article is dedicated to his memory.</description>

      <title>Interpolant of truncated multiple zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an analytic function $\Psi(s_1,\ldots,s_r;w)$ that interpolates truncated multiple zeta functions $\zeta_N(s_1,\ldots,s_r)$. We represent this interpolant as a Mellin transform of a function $G(q_1,\ldots,q_r;w)$ and, using this expression, give the analytic continuation. Further, the harmonic product relations for $\Psi$ and $G$ are established via relevant Hopf algebra structures, and some properties of the function $G$ are provided.</description>

      <title>Jacobi sums and cyclotomic matrices involving squares over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q=p^n$ be an odd prime power and let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements. Let $\widehat{\mathbb{F}_q^{\times}}$ be the group of all multiplicative characters of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and let $\chi$ be a generator of $\widehat{\mathbb{F}_q^{\times}}$. In this paper, we investigate arithmetic properties of certain cyclotomic matrices involving nonzero squares over $\mathbb{F}_q$. For example, let $s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_{(q-1)/2}$ be the nonzero squares over $\mathbb{F}_q$. For any integer $1\le r\le q-2$, define the matrix
  $$B_q(r):=\left[\chi^r(s_i+s_j)+\chi^r(s_i-s_j)\right]_{1\le i,j\le (q-1)/2}.$$
  We prove that if $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$, then
  $$\det (B_q(r))=\prod_{0\le k\le (q-3)/2}J_q(\chi^r,\chi^{2k})=
  \begin{cases}
  (-1)^{\frac{q-3}{4}}{\bf i}^nG_q(\chi^r)^{\frac{q-1}{2}}/\sqrt{q} &amp; \mbox{if}\ r\equiv 1\pmod 2,
  G_q(\chi^r)^{\frac{q-1}{2}}/q &amp; \mbox{if}\ r\equiv 0\pmod 2.
  \end{cases},$$
  where $J_q(\chi^r,\chi^{2k})$ and $G_q(\chi^r)$ are the Jacobi sum and the Gauss sum over $\mathbb{F}_q$ respectively.</description>

      <title>$P_d$ polynomials and Variants of Chinburg's Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides some solutions to Chinburg's conjectures by studying a sequence of the Mahler measure of multivariate exact polynomials. These conjectures assert that for every odd quadratic Dirichlet Character of conductor $f$, $\chi_{-f}=\left(\frac{-f}{.}\right)$, there exists a bivariate polynomial (or a rational polynomial in the weak version) whose Mahler measure is a rational multiple of $L'(\chi_{-f},-1)$. To obtain such solutions for the conjectures we study a polynomial family denoted by $P_d(x,y)$, whose Mahler measure has been fully studied in \cite{mehrabdollahei2021mahler}, and \cite{BGMP}. We demonstrate that the Mahler measure of $P_d$ can be expressed as a linear combination of Dirichlet $L$-functions, which has the potential to generate solutions to the conjectures. Specifically, we prove that this family provides solutions for conductors $f=3,4,8,15,20,24$. Notably, $P_d$ polynomials provide intriguing examples where the Mahler measures are linked to $L'(\chi,-1)$ with $\chi$ being an odd non-real primitive Dirichlet character. These examples inspired us to generalize Chinburg's conjectures from real primitive odd Dirichlet characters to all primitive odd characters. For the generalized version of Chinburg's conjecture, $P_d$ polynomials provide solutions for conductors $5,7,9$.</description>

Abstract: Given a totally real number field $F$, we show that there are only finitely many totally real extensions of $K$ of a fixed degree that admit a universal quadratic form defined over $F$. We further obtain several explicit classification results in the case of relative quadratic extensions.</description>

      <title>Transformation properties of Andrews-Beck $NT$ functions and generalized Appell-Lerch series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Andrews mentioned that George Beck introduced a partition statistic $NT(r,m,n)$ which is related to Dyson's rank statistic. Motivated by Andrews's work, scholars have established a number of congruences and identities involving $NT(r,m,n)$. In this paper, we strengthen and extend a recent work of Mao on the transformation properties of the $NT$ function and provide an analogy of Hickerson and Mortenson's work on the rank function. As an application, we demonstrate how one can deduce from our results many identities involving $NT(r,m,n)$ and another crank-analog statistic $M_\omega(r,m,n)$. As a related result, some new properties of generalized Appell-Lerch series are given.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{\rho_{\ell}:\mathrm{Gal}_K\to\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_{\ell})\}_{\ell}$ be a semisimple compatible system of $\ell$-adic representations of a number field $K$ that is arising from geometry. Let $\textbf{G}_{\ell}\subset\mathrm{GL}_{n,\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}}$ and $\widehat{\underline{G_{\ell}}}\subset\mathrm{GL}_{n,\mathbb{F}_\ell}$ be respectively the algebraic monodromy group and full algebraic envelope of $\rho_{\ell}$. We prove that there is a natural isomorphism between the component groups $\pi_0(\textbf{G}_{\ell}) \simeq \pi_0(\widehat{\underline{G_\ell}})$ for all sufficiently large $\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the algebraic Picard group of the category of $K(n)$-local spectra, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$. In particular, we show that it is always finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \geq 2$, is of rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early 1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a full set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on recent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation on Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing of Ceresa and Gross--Kudla--Schoen cycles associated to modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an algebraic curve $X$ of genus $\ge 3$, one can construct two algebraic $1$-cycles, the Ceresa cycle and the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal cycle, each living in the Jacobian of $X$ and the triple product $X \times X \times X$ respectively. These two cycles are homologically trivial but are of infinite order in their corresponding Chow groups for a very general curve over $\mathbb{C}$. From the work of S-W Zhang, for a fixed curve these two cycles are non-torsion in their corresponding Chow groups if and only if one of them is. In this paper, we prove that the Ceresa and Gross-Kudla-Schoen cycles associated to a modular curve $X$ are non-torsion in the corresponding Chow groups when $X=\Gamma \backslash \overline{\mathbb{H}}$ for certain congruence subgroups $\Gamma\subset {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We obtain the result by studying a pullback formula for special divisors by the diagonal map $X \hookrightarrow X \times X$.</description>

Abstract: The denominators $d_n$ of the harmonic number $1+\frac12+\frac13+\cdots+\frac1n$ do not increase monotonically with~$n$. It is conjectured that $d_n=D_n={\rm LCM}(1,2,\ldots,n)$ infinitely often. For an odd prime $p$, the set $\{n:pd_n|D_n\}$ has a harmonic density. Moreover, for $2&lt;p_1&lt;p_2&lt;\cdots&lt;p_k$, with $\log p_1/\log p_i$ ($1\le i\le k$) being linearly independent, there exists $n$ such that $p_1p_2\cdots p_kd_n|D_n$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the cohomology of canonical extensions of automorphic vector bundles over toroidal compactifications of Shimura varieties can be computed by relative Lie algebra cohomology of automorphic forms. Our result is inspired by and parallel to Borel and Franke's work on the cohomology of automorphic local systems on locally symmetric spaces, and also generalizes a theorem of Mumford.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.16082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a "twist-compatibility" result for p-adic families of cohomology classes associated to symmetric spaces. This shows that a single family of classes (lying in a finitely-generated Iwasawa module) interpolates classical cohomology classes of many different weights, including twists by Gr\"ossencharacters of possibly non-trivial infinity-type. This subsumes and generalises a number of prior results relating to Euler systems and p-adic L-functions, and we conclude with some novel applications to Euler systems for GSp(4), GSp(4) x GL(2), and GSp(4) x GL(2) x GL(2).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.03767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Montgomery and Soundararajan showed that the distribution of $\psi(x+H) - \psi(x)$, for $0 \le x \le N$, is approximately normal with mean $ \sim H$ and variance $\sim H \log (N/H)$, when $N^{\delta} \le H \le N^{1-\delta}$. Their work depends on showing that sums $R_k(h)$ of $k$-term singular series are $\mu_k(-h \log h + Ah)^{k/2} + O_k(h^{k/2-1/(7k) + \varepsilon})$, where $A$ is a constant and $\mu_k$ are the Gaussian moment constants. We study lower-order terms in the size of these moments. We conjecture that when $k$ is odd, $R_k(h) \asymp h^{(k-1)/2}(\log h)^{(k+1)/2}$. We prove an upper bound with the correct power of $h$ when $k = 3$, and prove analogous upper bounds in the function field setting when $k =3$ and $k = 5$. We provide further evidence for this conjecture in the form of numerical computations.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field with $q$ elements and consider the rational function field $K:=\mathbb{F}_q(\theta)$. For a Drinfeld module $\phi$ defined over $K$, we study the transcendence of special values of the Goss $L$-function attached to the abelian $t$-motive $M_{\phi}$ of $\phi$. Moreover, when $\phi$ is a Drinfeld module of rank $r\geq 2$ defined over $K$ which has everywhere good reduction, we prove that the value of the Goss $L$-function attached to the $(r-1)$-st exterior power of $M_{\phi}$ at any positive integer is transcendental over $K$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the average value of the Frobenius trace at p over elliptic curves in a fixed conductor range with given rank. Plotting this average as p varies over the primes yields a striking oscillating pattern, the details of which vary with the rank. Based on this observation, we perform various data-scientific experiments with the goal of classifying elliptic curves according to their ranks.</description>

      <title>Old Meets New: Connecting Two Infinite Families of Congruences Modulo Powers of 5 for Generalized Frobenius Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18509</link>

Abstract: In 2012 Paule and Radu proved a difficult family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for Andrews' 2-colored generalized Frobenius partition function. The family is associated with the classical modular curve of level 20. We demonstrate the existence of a congruence family for a related generalized Frobenius partition function associated with the same curve. We construct an isomorphism between this new family and the original family of congruences via a mapping on the associated rings of modular functions. The pairing of the congruence families provides a new strategy for future work on congruences associated with modular curves of composite level. We show how a similar approach can be made to multiple other recent examples in the literature. We also give some important insights into the behavior of these congruence families with respect to the Atkin--Lehner involution which proved very important in Paule and Radu's original proof.</description>

      <title>A user's guide to Beilinson-Kato's zeta elements</title>

Abstract: In his ground-breaking work, K. Kato constructed the Euler system of Beilinson--Kato's zeta elements and proved spectacular results on the Iwasawa main conjecture for elliptic curves and the classical and $p$-adic Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjectures by using these elements. The goal of this expository lecture note is to explain how Kato's Euler systems fit into the framework of the arithmetic of elliptic curves and their Iwasawa theory, and we hope that this approach eventually helps the reader to read Kato's original paper more easily and with less pain. It is written for the proceedings of the program "Elliptic curves and the special values of $L$-functions (ONLINE)" in ICTS in August 2021.</description>

      <title>Some explicit arithmetic on curves of genus three and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02926</link>

Abstract: A Richelot isogeny between Jacobian varieties is an isogeny whose kernel is included in the $2$-torsion subgroup of the domain. A Richelot isogeny whose codomain is the product of two or more principally polarized abelian varieties is called a decomposed Richelot isogeny.
  In this paper, we develop some explicit arithmetic on curves of genus $3$, including algorithms to compute the codomain of a decomposed Richelot isogeny. As solutions to compute the domain of a decomposed Richelot isogeny, explicit formulae of defining equations for Howe curves of genus $3$ are also given. Using the formulae, we shall construct an algorithm with complexity $\tilde{O}(p^3)$ (resp. $\tilde{O}(p^4)$) to enumerate all hyperelliptic (resp. non-hyperelliptic) superspecial Howe curves of genus $3$.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolyadic structures</title>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of division algebras, the hyperpolyadic algebras, which correspond to the binary division algebras $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ without considering new elements. First, we use the matrix polyadization procedure proposed earlier which increases the dimension of the algebra. The algebras obtained in this way obey binary addition and a nonderived n-ary multiplication and their subalgebras are division n-ary algebras. For each invertible element we define a new norm which is polyadically multiplicative, and the corresponding map is a $n$-ary homomorphism. We define a polyadic analog of the Cayley-Dickson construction which corresponds to the consequent embedding of monomial matrices from the polyadization procedure. We then obtain another series of n-ary algebras corresponding to the binary division algebras which have a higher dimension, that is proportional to the intermediate arities. Second, a new polyadic product of vectors in any vector space is defined. Endowed with this product the vector space becomes a polyadic algebra which is a division algebra under some invertibility conditions, and its structure constants are computed. Third, we propose a new iterative process ("imaginary tower"), which leads to nonunital nonderived ternary division algebras of half the dimension, which we call "half-quaternions" and "half-octonions". The latter are not subalgebras of the binary division algebras, but subsets only, since they have different arity. Nevertheless, they are actually ternary division algebras, because they allow division, and their nonzero elements are invertible. From the multiplicativity of the introduced "half-quaternion" norm we obtain the ternary analog of the sum of two squares identity. We show that the ternary division algebra of imaginary "half-octonions" is unitless and totally associative.</description>
