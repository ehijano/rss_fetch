      <title>An iterated learning model of language change that mixes supervised and unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iterated learning model is an agent-based model of language change in which language is transmitted from a tutor to a pupil which itself becomes a tutor to a new pupil, and so on. Languages that are stable, expressive, and compositional arise spontaneously as a consequence of a language transmission bottleneck. Previous models have implemented an agent's mapping from signals to meanings using an artificial neural network decoder, but have relied on an unrealistic and computationally expensive process of obversion to implement the associated encoder, mapping from meanings to signals. Here, a new model is presented in which both decoder and encoder are neural networks, trained separately through supervised learning, and trained together through unsupervised learning in the form of an autoencoder. This avoids the substantial computational burden entailed in obversion and introduces a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning as observed during human development.</description>

      <title>A soluble model for synchronized rhythmic activity in ant colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is one of the most striking instances of collective behavior, occurring in many natural phenomena. For example, in some ant species, ants are inactive within the nest most of the time, but their bursts of activity are highly synchronized and involve the entire nest population. Here we revisit a simulation model that generates this synchronized rhythmic activity through autocatalytic behavior, i.e., active ants can activate inactive ants, followed by a period of rest. We derive a set of delay differential equations that provide an accurate description of the short- and medium-time simulations for large ant colonies. Analysis of the fixed-point solutions, complemented by numerical integration of the equations, indicates the existence of stable limit-cycle solutions when the rest period is greater than a threshold and the event of spontaneous activation of inactive ants is very unlikely, so that most of the arousal of ants is done by active ants. Furthermore, we argue that the persistent oscillations observed in the simulations for colonies of finite size are due to resonant amplification of demographic noise.</description>

      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>
