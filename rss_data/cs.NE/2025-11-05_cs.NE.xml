      <title>Structural Plasticity as Active Inference: A Biologically-Inspired Architecture for Homeostatic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Algorithm for Chance Constrained Quadratic Multiple Knapsack Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic multiple knapsack problem (QMKP) is a combinatorial optimisation problem characterised by multiple weight capacity constraints and a profit function that combines linear and quadratic profits. We study a stochastic variant of this problem where profits are considered as random variables. This problem reflects complex resource allocation problems in real-world scenarios where randomness is inherent. We model this problem using chance constraints to capture the stochastic profits. We propose a hybrid approach for this problem, which combines an evolutionary algorithm (EA) with a local optimisation strategy inspired by multi-factorial optimisation (MFO). EAs are used for global search due to their effectiveness in handling large, complex solution spaces. In the hybrid approach, EA periodically passes interim solutions to the local optimiser for refinement. The local optimiser applies MFO principles, which are typically used in multi-tasking problems. The local optimiser models the local problem as a multi-tasking problem by constructing disjoint search spaces for each knapsack based on an input solution. For each item, its assignment across all knapsacks is considered to determine the preferred knapsack. Items are then divided into disjoint groups corresponding to each knapsack, allowing each knapsack to be treated as a separate optimisation task. This structure enables effective application of MFO-based local refinements. We consider two EAs for the problem, (1+1) EA and ($\mu+\lambda$) EA. We conduct experiments to explore the effectiveness of these EAs on their own and also with the proposed local optimiser. Experimental results suggest that hybrid approaches, particularly those incorporating MFO, perform well on instances where chance constraints and capacity constraints are tight.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Maximization as a Principle of Associative Memory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the local computational principles which are required to enable this function remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory - Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of different inputs to an output into unique information from each input, redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Machine Learning meets Self-Supervised Learning: a comprehensive survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of studies that combine Evolutionary Machine Learning and self-supervised learning has been growing steadily in recent years. Evolutionary Machine Learning has been shown to help automate the design of machine learning algorithms and to lead to more reliable solutions. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, has produced good results in learning useful features when labelled data is limited. This suggests that the combination of these two areas can help both in shaping evolutionary processes and in automating the design of deep neural networks, while also reducing the need for labelled data. Still, there are no detailed reviews that explain how Evolutionary Machine Learning and self-supervised learning can be used together. To help with this, we provide an overview of studies that bring these areas together. Based on this growing interest and the range of existing works, we suggest a new sub-area of research, which we call Evolutionary Self-Supervised Learning and introduce a taxonomy for it. Finally, we point out some of the main challenges and suggest directions for future research to help Evolutionary Self-Supervised Learning grow and mature as a field.</description>

      <title>The Physical Basis of Prediction: World Model Formation in Neural Organoids via an LLM-Generated Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.</description>
