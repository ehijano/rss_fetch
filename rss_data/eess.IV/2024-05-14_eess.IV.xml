      <title>BubbleID: A Deep Learning Framework for Bubble Interface Dynamics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents BubbleID, a sophisticated deep learning architecture designed to comprehensively identify both static and dynamic attributes of bubbles within sequences of boiling images. By amalgamating segmentation powered by Mask R-CNN with SORT-based tracking techniques, the framework is capable of analyzing each bubble's location, dimensions, interface shape, and velocity over its lifetime, and capturing dynamic events such as bubble departure. BubbleID is trained and tested on boiling images across diverse heater surfaces and operational settings. This paper also offers a comparative analysis of bubble interface dynamics prior to and post-critical heat flux (CHF) conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging for Breast Cancer Tumour Delineation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant cause of death from cancer in women globally, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic imaging to enhance patient outcomes. Accurate tumour identification is essential for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, emphasizing the importance of advanced imaging technologies that provide detailed views of tumour characteristics and disease. Synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) is a recent method that has shown promise for prostate cancer delineation compared to current MRI images. In this paper, we explore tuning the coefficients in the computation of CDI$^s$ for breast cancer tumour delineation by maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using a Nelder-Mead simplex optimization strategy. We show that the best AUC is achieved by the CDI$^s$ - Optimized modality, outperforming the best gold-standard modality by 0.0044. Notably, the optimized CDI$^s$ modality also achieves AUC values over 0.02 higher than the Unoptimized CDI$^s$ value, demonstrating the importance of optimizing the CDI$^s$ exponents for the specific cancer application.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Histology Slide Digitization Workflows for Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histology slide digitization is becoming essential for telepathology (remote consultation), knowledge sharing (education), and using the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms (augmented/automated end-to-end clinical workflows). However, the cumulative costs of digital multi-slide high-speed brightfield scanners, cloud/on-premises storage, and personnel (IT and technicians) make the current slide digitization workflows out-of-reach for limited-resource settings, further widening the health equity gap; even single-slide manual scanning commercial solutions are costly due to hardware requirements (high-resolution cameras, high-spec PC/workstation, and support for only high-end microscopes). In this work, we present a new cloud slide digitization workflow for creating scanner-quality whole-slide images (WSIs) from uploaded low-quality videos, acquired from cheap and inexpensive microscopes with built-in cameras. Specifically, we present a pipeline to create stitched WSIs while automatically deblurring out-of-focus regions, upsampling input 10X images to 40X resolution, and reducing brightness/contrast and light-source illumination variations. We demonstrate the WSI creation efficacy from our workflow on World Health Organization-declared neglected tropical disease, Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (prevalent only in the poorest regions of the world and only diagnosed by sub-specialist dermatopathologists, rare in poor countries), as well as other common pathologies on core biopsies of breast, liver, duodenum, stomach and lymph node. The code and pretrained models will be accessible via our GitHub (https://github.com/nadeemlab/DeepLIIF), and the cloud platform will be available at https://deepliif.org for uploading microscope videos and downloading/viewing WSIs with shareable links (no sign-in required) for telepathology and knowledge sharing.</description>

      <title>Do Bayesian imaging methods report trustworthy probabilities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian statistics is a cornerstone of imaging sciences, underpinning many and varied approaches from Markov random fields to score-based denoising diffusion models. In addition to powerful image estimation methods, the Bayesian paradigm also provides a framework for uncertainty quantification and for using image data as quantitative evidence. These probabilistic capabilities are important for the rigorous interpretation of experimental results and for robust interfacing of quantitative imaging pipelines with scientific and decision-making processes. However, are the probabilities delivered by existing Bayesian imaging methods meaningful under replication of an experiment, or are they only meaningful as subjective measures of belief? This paper presents a Monte Carlo method to explore this question. We then leverage the proposed Monte Carlo method and run a large experiment requiring 1,000 GPU-hours to probe the accuracy of five canonical Bayesian imaging methods that are representative of some of the main Bayesian imaging strategies from the past decades (a score-based denoising diffusion technique, a plug-and-play Langevin algorithm utilising a Lipschitz-regularised DnCNN denoiser, a Bayesian method with a dictionary-based prior trained subject to a log-concavity constraint, an empirical Bayesian method with a total-variation prior, and a hierarchical Bayesian Gibbs sampler based on a Gaussian Markov random field model). We find that, a few cases, the probabilities reported by modern Bayesian imaging techniques are in broad agreement with long-term averages as observed over a large number of replication of an experiment, but existing Bayesian imaging methods are generally not able to deliver reliable uncertainty quantification results.</description>

      <title>Automated classification of multi-parametric body MRI series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) studies are widely available in clinical practice for the diagnosis of various diseases. As the volume of mpMRI exams increases yearly, there are concomitant inaccuracies that exist within the DICOM header fields of these exams. This precludes the use of the header information for the arrangement of the different series as part of the radiologist's hanging protocol, and clinician oversight is needed for correction. In this pilot work, we propose an automated framework to classify the type of 8 different series in mpMRI studies. We used 1,363 studies acquired by three Siemens scanners to train a DenseNet-121 model with 5-fold cross-validation. Then, we evaluated the performance of the DenseNet-121 ensemble on a held-out test set of 313 mpMRI studies. Our method achieved an average precision of 96.6%, sensitivity of 96.6%, specificity of 99.6%, and F1 score of 96.6% for the MRI series classification task. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a method to classify the series type in mpMRI studies acquired at the level of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Our method has the capability for robust automation of hanging protocols in modern radiology practice.</description>

      <title>Automatic Segmentation of the Kidneys and Cystic Renal Lesions on Non-Contrast CT Using a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Automated segmentation tools are useful for calculating kidney volumes rapidly and accurately. Furthermore, these tools have the power to facilitate large-scale image-based artificial intelligence projects by generating input labels, such as for image registration algorithms. Prior automated segmentation models have largely ignored non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging. This work aims to implement and train a deep learning (DL) model to segment the kidneys and cystic renal lesions (CRLs) from non-contrast CT scans.
  Methods: Manual segmentation of the kidneys and CRLs was performed on 150 non-contrast abdominal CT scans. The data were divided into an 80/20 train/test split and a deep learning (DL) model was trained to segment the kidneys and CRLs. Various scoring metrics were used to assess model performance, including the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), and absolute and percent error kidney volume and lesion volume. Bland-Altman (B-A) analysis was performed to compare manual versus DL-based kidney volumes.
  Results: The DL model achieved a median kidney DSC of 0.934, median CRL DSC of 0.711, and total median study DSC of 0.823. Average volume errors were 0.9% for renal parenchyma, 37.0% for CRLs, and 2.2% overall. B-A analysis demonstrated that DL-based volumes tended to be greater than manual volumes, with a mean bias of +3.0 ml (+/- 2 SD of +/- 50.2 ml).
  Conclusion: A deep learning model trained to segment kidneys and cystic renal lesions on non-contrast CT examinations was able to provide highly accurate segmentations, with a median kidney Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.934.

      <title>NAFRSSR: a Lightweight Recursive Network for Efficient Stereo Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo image super-resolution (SR) refers to the reconstruction of a high-resolution (HR) image from a pair of low-resolution (LR) images as typically captured by a dual-camera device. To enhance the quality of SR images, most previous studies focused on increasing the number and size of feature maps and introducing complex and computationally intensive structures, resulting in models with high computational complexity. Here, we propose a simple yet efficient stereo image SR model called NAFRSSR, which is modified from the previous state-of-the-art model NAFSSR by introducing recursive connections and lightweighting the constituent modules. Our NAFRSSR model is composed of nonlinear activation free and group convolution-based blocks (NAFGCBlocks) and depth-separated stereo cross attention modules (DSSCAMs). The NAFGCBlock improves feature extraction and reduces number of parameters by removing the simple channel attention mechanism from NAFBlock and using group convolution. The DSSCAM enhances feature fusion and reduces number of parameters by replacing 1x1 pointwise convolution in SCAM with weight-shared 3x3 depthwise convolution. Besides, we propose to incorporate trainable edge detection operator into NAFRSSR to further improve the model performance. Four variants of NAFRSSR with different sizes, namely, NAFRSSR-Mobile (NAFRSSR-M), NAFRSSR-Tiny (NAFRSSR-T), NAFRSSR-Super (NAFRSSR-S) and NAFRSSR-Base (NAFRSSR-B) are designed, and they all exhibit fewer parameters, higher PSNR/SSIM, and faster speed than the previous state-of-the-art models. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, NAFRSSR-M is the lightest (0.28M parameters) and fastest (50 ms inference time) model achieving an average PSNR/SSIM as high as 24.657 dB/0.7622 on the benchmark datasets. Codes and models will be released at https://github.com/JNUChenYiHong/NAFRSSR.</description>

      <title>Similarity Metrics for MR Image-To-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation can create large impact in medical imaging, i.e. if images of a patient can be translated to another modality, type or sequence for better diagnosis. However, these methods must be validated by human reader studies, which are costly and restricted to small samples. Automatic evaluation of large samples to pre-evaluate and continuously improve methods before human validation is needed. In this study, we give an overview of reference and non-reference metrics for image synthesis assessment and investigate the ability of nine metrics, that need a reference (SSIM, MS-SSIM, PSNR, MSE, NMSE, MAE, LPIPS, NMI and PCC) and three non-reference metrics (BLUR, MSN, MNG) to detect 11 kinds of distortions in MR images from the BraSyn dataset. In addition we test a downstream segmentation metric and the effect of three normalization methods (Minmax, cMinMax and Zscore). Although PSNR and SSIM are frequently used to evaluate generative models for image-to-image-translation tasks in the medical domain, they show very specific shortcomings. SSIM ignores blurring but is very sensitive to intensity shifts in unnormalized MR images. PSNR is even more sensitive to different normalization methods and hardly measures the degree of distortions. Further metrics, such as LPIPS, NMI and DICE can be very useful to evaluate other similarity aspects. If the images to be compared are misaligned, most metrics are flawed. By carefully selecting and reasonably combining image similarity metrics, the training and selection of generative models for MR image synthesis can be improved. Many aspects of their output can be validated before final and costly evaluation by trained radiologists is conducted.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Instance-Adaptive Neural Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to the standard video codecs, demonstrating promising performance, and simple and easily maintainable pipelines. However, NVCs often fall short of compression performance and occasionally exhibit poor generalization capability due to inference-only compression scheme and their dependence on training data. The instance-adaptive video compression techniques have recently been suggested as a viable solution, fine-tuning the encoder or decoder networks for a particular test instance video. However, fine-tuning all the model parameters incurs high computational costs, increases the bitrates, and often leads to unstable training. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient instance-adaptive video compression framework. Inspired by the remarkable success of parameter-efficient fine-tuning on large-scale neural network models, we propose to use a lightweight adapter module that can be easily attached to the pretrained NVCs and fine-tuned for test video sequences. The resulting algorithm significantly improves compression performance and reduces the encoding time compared to the existing instant-adaptive video compression algorithms. Furthermore, the suggested fine-tuning method enhances the robustness of the training process, allowing for the proposed method to be widely used in many practical settings. We conducted extensive experiments on various standard benchmark datasets, including UVG, MCL-JVC, and HEVC sequences, and the experimental results have shown a significant improvement in rate-distortion (RD) curves (up to 5 dB PSNR improvements) and BD rates compared to the baselines NVC.</description>

      <title>Shape-aware synthesis of pathological lung CT scans using CycleGAN for enhanced semi-supervised lung segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of pathological lung segmentation, a significant challenge in medical image analysis, particularly pronounced in cases of peripheral opacities (severe fibrosis and consolidation) because of the textural similarity between lung tissue and surrounding areas. To overcome these challenges, this paper emphasizes the use of CycleGAN for unpaired image-to-image translation, in order to provide an augmentation method able to generate fake pathological images matching an existing ground truth. Although previous studies have employed CycleGAN, they often neglect the challenge of shape deformation, which is crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. Our work introduces an innovative strategy that incorporates additional loss functions. Specifically, it proposes an L1 loss based on the lung surrounding which shape is constrained to remain unchanged at the transition from the healthy to pathological domains. The lung surrounding is derived based on ground truth lung masks available in the healthy domain. Furthermore, preprocessing steps, such as cropping based on ribs/vertebra locations, are applied to refine the input for the CycleGAN, ensuring that the network focus on the lung region. This is essential to avoid extraneous biases, such as the zoom effect bias, which can divert attention from the main task. The method is applied to enhance in semi-supervised manner the lung segmentation process by employing a U-Net model trained with on-the-fly data augmentation incorporating synthetic pathological tissues generated by the CycleGAN model. Preliminary results from this research demonstrate significant qualitative and quantitative improvements, setting a new benchmark in the field of pathological lung segmentation.

      <title>RMT-BVQA: Recurrent Memory Transformer-based Blind Video Quality Assessment for Enhanced Video Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advances in deep learning, numerous algorithms have been developed to enhance video quality, reduce visual artefacts and improve perceptual quality. However, little research has been reported on the quality assessment of enhanced content - the evaluation of enhancement methods is often based on quality metrics that were designed for compression applications. In this paper, we propose a novel blind deep video quality assessment (VQA) method specifically for enhanced video content. It employs a new Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) based network architecture to obtain video quality representations, which is optimised through a novel content-quality-aware contrastive learning strategy based on a new database containing 13K training patches with enhanced content. The extracted quality representations are then combined through linear regression to generate video-level quality indices. The proposed method, RMT-BVQA, has been evaluated on the VDPVE (VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement) database through a five-fold cross validation. The results show its superior correlation performance when compared to ten existing no-reference quality metrics.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning improves robustness of deep learning lung tumor segmentation to CT imaging differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an approach to extract useful feature representations from unlabeled data, and enable fine-tuning on downstream tasks with limited labeled examples. Self-pretraining is a SSL approach that uses the curated task dataset for both pretraining the networks and fine-tuning them. Availability of large, diverse, and uncurated public medical image sets provides the opportunity to apply SSL in the "wild" and potentially extract features robust to imaging variations. However, the benefit of wild- vs self-pretraining has not been studied for medical image analysis. In this paper, we compare robustness of wild versus self-pretrained transformer (vision transformer [ViT] and hierarchical shifted window [Swin]) models to computed tomography (CT) imaging differences for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) segmentation. Wild-pretrained Swin models outperformed self-pretrained Swin for the various imaging acquisitions. ViT resulted in similar accuracy for both wild- and self-pretrained models. Masked image prediction pretext task that forces networks to learn the local structure resulted in higher accuracy compared to contrastive task that models global image information. Wild-pretrained models resulted in higher feature reuse at the lower level layers and feature differentiation close to output layer after fine-tuning. Hence, we conclude: Wild-pretrained networks were more robust to analyzed CT imaging differences for lung tumor segmentation than self-pretrained methods. Swin architecture benefited from such pretraining more than ViT.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Black Box: Do More Complex Models Provide Superior XAI Explanations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of Artificial Intelligence models poses challenges to interpretability, particularly in the healthcare sector. This study investigates the impact of deep learning model complexity and Explainable AI (XAI) efficacy, utilizing four ResNet architectures (ResNet-18, 34, 50, 101). Through methodical experimentation on 4,369 lung X-ray images of COVID-19-infected and healthy patients, the research evaluates models' classification performance and the relevance of corresponding XAI explanations with respect to the ground-truth disease masks. Results indicate that the increase in model complexity is associated with a decrease in classification accuracy and AUC-ROC scores (ResNet-18: 98.4%, 0.997; ResNet-101: 95.9%, 0.988). Notably, in eleven out of twelve statistical tests performed, no statistically significant differences occurred between XAI quantitative metrics - Relevance Rank Accuracy and the proposed Positive Attribution Ratio - across trained models. These results suggest that increased model complexity does not consistently lead to higher performance or relevance of explanations for models' decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>EndoDAC: Efficient Adapting Foundation Model for Self-Supervised Depth Estimation from Any Endoscopic Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in various tasks within endoscopic surgery, including navigation, surface reconstruction, and augmented reality visualization. Despite the significant achievements of foundation models in vision tasks, including depth estimation, their direct application to the medical domain often results in suboptimal performance. This highlights the need for efficient adaptation methods to adapt these models to endoscopic depth estimation. We propose Endoscopic Depth Any Camera (EndoDAC) which is an efficient self-supervised depth estimation framework that adapts foundation models to endoscopic scenes. Specifically, we develop the Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LoRA) and employ Convolutional Neck blocks to tailor the foundational model to the surgical domain, utilizing remarkably few trainable parameters. Given that camera information is not always accessible, we also introduce a self-supervised adaptation strategy that estimates camera intrinsics using the pose encoder. Our framework is capable of being trained solely on monocular surgical videos from any camera, ensuring minimal training costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains superior performance even with fewer training epochs and unaware of the ground truth camera intrinsics.

      <title>Enhancing Blind Video Quality Assessment with Rich Quality-aware Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple but effective method to enhance blind video quality assessment (BVQA) models for social media videos. Motivated by previous researches that leverage pre-trained features extracted from various computer vision models as the feature representation for BVQA, we further explore rich quality-aware features from pre-trained blind image quality assessment (BIQA) and BVQA models as auxiliary features to help the BVQA model to handle complex distortions and diverse content of social media videos. Specifically, we use SimpleVQA, a BVQA model that consists of a trainable Swin Transformer-B and a fixed SlowFast, as our base model. The Swin Transformer-B and SlowFast components are responsible for extracting spatial and motion features, respectively. Then, we extract three kinds of features from Q-Align, LIQE, and FAST-VQA to capture frame-level quality-aware features, frame-level quality-aware along with scene-specific features, and spatiotemporal quality-aware features, respectively. Through concatenating these features, we employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to regress them into quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the best performance on three public social media VQA datasets. Moreover, the proposed model won first place in the CVPR NTIRE 2024 Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/sunwei925/RQ-VQA.git}.</description>

      <title>The Developing Human Connectome Project: A Fast Deep Learning-based Pipeline for Neonatal Cortical Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) aims to explore developmental patterns of the human brain during the perinatal period. An automated processing pipeline has been developed to extract high-quality cortical surfaces from structural brain magnetic resonance (MR) images for the dHCP neonatal dataset. However, the current implementation of the pipeline requires more than 6.5 hours to process a single MRI scan, making it expensive for large-scale neuroimaging studies. In this paper, we propose a fast deep learning (DL) based pipeline for dHCP neonatal cortical surface reconstruction, incorporating DL-based brain extraction, cortical surface reconstruction and spherical projection, as well as GPU-accelerated cortical surface inflation and cortical feature estimation. We introduce a multiscale deformation network to learn diffeomorphic cortical surface reconstruction end-to-end from T2-weighted brain MRI. A fast unsupervised spherical mapping approach is integrated to minimize metric distortions between cortical surfaces and projected spheres. The entire workflow of our DL-based dHCP pipeline completes within only 24 seconds on a modern GPU, which is nearly 1000 times faster than the original dHCP pipeline. Manual quality control demonstrates that for 82.5% of the test samples, our DL-based pipeline produces superior (54.2%) or equal quality (28.3%) cortical surfaces compared to the original dHCP pipeline.</description>

      <title>Can we Defend Against the Unknown? An Empirical Study About Threshold Selection for Neural Network Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use of neural networks in critical systems, runtime monitoring becomes essential to reject unsafe predictions during inference. Various techniques have emerged to establish rejection scores that maximize the separability between the distributions of safe and unsafe predictions. The efficacy of these approaches is mostly evaluated using threshold-agnostic metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, in real-world applications, an effective monitor also requires identifying a good threshold to transform these scores into meaningful binary decisions. Despite the pivotal importance of threshold optimization, this problem has received little attention. A few studies touch upon this question, but they typically assume that the runtime data distribution mirrors the training distribution, which is a strong assumption as monitors are supposed to safeguard a system against potentially unforeseen threats. In this work, we present rigorous experiments on various image datasets to investigate: 1. The effectiveness of monitors in handling unforeseen threats, which are not available during threshold adjustments. 2. Whether integrating generic threats into the threshold optimization scheme can enhance the robustness of monitors.</description>

      <title>CheXmask: a large-scale dataset of anatomical segmentation masks for multi-center chest x-ray images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03293v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of successful artificial intelligence models for chest X-ray analysis relies on large, diverse datasets with high-quality annotations. While several databases of chest X-ray images have been released, most include disease diagnosis labels but lack detailed pixel-level anatomical segmentation labels. To address this gap, we introduce an extensive chest X-ray multi-center segmentation dataset with uniform and fine-grain anatomical annotations for images coming from five well-known publicly available databases: ChestX-ray8, Chexpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, Padchest, and VinDr-CXR, resulting in 657,566 segmentation masks. Our methodology utilizes the HybridGNet model to ensure consistent and high-quality segmentations across all datasets. Rigorous validation, including expert physician evaluation and automatic quality control, was conducted to validate the resulting masks. Additionally, we provide individualized quality indices per mask and an overall quality estimation per dataset. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for the broader scientific community, streamlining the development and assessment of innovative methodologies in chest X-ray analysis. The CheXmask dataset is publicly available at: https://physionet.org/content/chexmask-cxr-segmentation-data/</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for in vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. We propose to use the \textit{a priori} knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC \textit{in vivo} in 5 mouse brains. We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\mu$m to 18.3 $\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction.</description>

      <title>Segmentation Quality and Volumetric Accuracy in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current medical image segmentation relies on the region-based (Dice, F1-score) and boundary-based (Hausdorff distance, surface distance) metrics as the de-facto standard. While these metrics are widely used, they lack a unified interpretation, particularly regarding volume agreement. Clinicians often lack clear benchmarks to gauge the "goodness" of segmentation results based on these metrics. Recognizing the clinical relevance of volumetry, we utilize relative volume prediction error (vpe) to directly assess the accuracy of volume predictions derived from segmentation tasks. Our work integrates theoretical analysis and empirical validation across diverse datasets. We delve into the often-ambiguous relationship between segmentation quality (measured by Dice) and volumetric accuracy in clinical practice. Our findings highlight the critical role of incorporating volumetric prediction accuracy into segmentation evaluation. This approach empowers clinicians with a more nuanced understanding of segmentation performance, ultimately improving the interpretation and utility of these metrics in real-world healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Exploring Explainable AI Techniques for Improved Interpretability in Lung and Colon Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lung and colon cancer are serious worldwide health challenges that require early and precise identification to reduce mortality risks. However, diagnosis, which is mostly dependent on histopathologists' competence, presents difficulties and hazards when expertise is insufficient. While diagnostic methods like imaging and blood markers contribute to early detection, histopathology remains the gold standard, although time-consuming and vulnerable to inter-observer mistakes. Limited access to high-end technology further limits patients' ability to receive immediate medical care and diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have generated interest in its application to medical imaging analysis, specifically the use of histopathological images to diagnose lung and colon cancer. The goal of this investigation is to use and adapt existing pre-trained CNN-based models, such as Xception, DenseNet201, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, ResNet152, and InceptionResNetV2, to enhance classification through better augmentation strategies. The results show tremendous progress, with all eight models reaching impressive accuracy ranging from 97% to 99%. Furthermore, attention visualization techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, ScoreCAM, Faster Score-CAM, and LayerCAM, as well as Vanilla Saliency and SmoothGrad, are used to provide insights into the models' classification decisions, thereby improving interpretability and understanding of malignant and benign image classification.</description>

      <title>Intriguing Property and Counterfactual Explanation of GAN for Remote Sensing Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in the natural image field. However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS) image generation task, an extraordinary phenomenon is observed: the GAN model is more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for natural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images will change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per category. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy experiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in the GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Then we establish a structural causal model (SCM) of the data generation process and interpret the generated data as the counterfactuals. Based on this SCM, we theoretically prove that the quality of generated images is positively correlated with the amount of feature information. This provides insights for enriching the feature information learned by the GAN model during training. Consequently, we propose two innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and Entropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN model at the distributional and sample levels, respectively. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods. Extensive experiments on three RS datasets and two natural datasets show that our methods outperform the well-established models on RS image generation tasks.

      <title>Local Padding in Patch-Based GANs for Seamless Infinite-Sized Texture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02340v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Texture models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) use zero-padding to implicitly encode positional information of the image features. However, when extending the spatial input to generate images at large sizes, zero-padding can often lead to degradation of quality due to the incorrect positional information at the center of the image and limit the diversity within the generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating stochastic texture images at large arbitrary sizes using GANs model that is based on patch-by-patch generation. Instead of zero-padding, the model uses \textit{local padding} in the generator that shares border features between the generated patches; providing positional context and ensuring consistency at the boundaries. The proposed models are trainable on a single texture image and have a constant GPU scalability with respect to the output image size, and hence can generate images of infinite sizes. We show in the experiments that our method has a significant advancement beyond existing texture models in terms of the quality and diversity of the generated textures. Furthermore, the implementation of local padding in the state-of-the-art super-resolution models effectively eliminates tiling artifacts enabling large-scale super-resolution.

      <title>Where Visual Speech Meets Language: VSP-LLM Framework for Efficient and Context-Aware Visual Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In visual speech processing, context modeling capability is one of the most important requirements due to the ambiguous nature of lip movements. For example, homophenes, words that share identical lip movements but produce different sounds, can be distinguished by considering the context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Visual Speech Processing incorporated with LLMs (VSP-LLM), to maximize the context modeling ability by bringing the overwhelming power of LLMs. Specifically, VSP-LLM is designed to perform multi-tasks of visual speech recognition and translation, where the given instructions control the type of task. The input video is mapped to the input latent space of an LLM by employing a self-supervised visual speech model. Focused on the fact that there is redundant information in input frames, we propose a novel deduplication method that reduces the embedded visual features by employing visual speech units. Through the proposed deduplication and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), VSP-LLM can be trained in a computationally efficient manner. In the translation dataset, the MuAViC benchmark, we demonstrate that VSP-LLM trained on just 30 hours of labeled data can more effectively translate lip movements compared to the recent model trained with 433 hours of data.</description>
