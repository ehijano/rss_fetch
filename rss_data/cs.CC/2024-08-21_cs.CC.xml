      <title>Exact spectral gaps of random one-dimensional quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11201</link>

Abstract: The spectral gap of local random quantum circuits is a fundamental property that determines how close the moments of the circuit's unitaries match those of a Haar random distribution. When studying spectral gaps, it is common to bound these quantities using tools from statistical mechanics or via quantum information-based inequalities. By focusing on the second moment of one-dimensional unitary circuits where nearest neighboring gates act on sets of qudits (with open and closed boundary conditions), we show that one can exactly compute the associated spectral gaps. Indeed, having access to their functional form allows us to prove several important results, such as the fact that the spectral gap for closed boundary condition is exactly the square of the gap for open boundaries, as well as improve on previously known bounds for approximate design convergence. Finally, we verify our theoretical results by numerically computing the spectral gap for systems of up to 70 qubits, as well as comparing them to gaps of random orthogonal and symplectic circuits.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

      <title>On $[1,2]$-Domination in Interval and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04694</link>

Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a Dominating Set if each vertex in $V(G)\setminus S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$. Chellali et al. in 2013, by restricting the number of neighbors in $S$ of a vertex outside $S$, introduced the concept of $[1,j]$-dominating set. A set $D \subseteq V$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is called a $[1,j]$-Dominating Set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor and at most $j$ neighbors in $D$. The Minimum $[1,j]$-Domination problem is the problem of finding the minimum $[1,j]$-dominating set $D$. Given a positive integer $k$ and a graph $G = (V, E)$, the $[1,j]$-Domination Decision problem is to decide whether $G$ has a $[1,j]$-dominating set of cardinality at most $k$. A polynomial-time algorithm was obtained in split graphs for a constant $j$ in contrast to the Dominating Set problem which is NP-hard for split graphs. This result motivates us to investigate the effect of restriction $j$ on the complexity of $[1,j]$-domination problem on various classes of graphs. Although for $j\geq 3$, it has been proved that the minimum of classical domination is equal to minimum $[1,j]$-domination in interval graphs, the complexity of finding the minimum $[1,2]$-domination in interval graphs is still outstanding. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set on interval graphs by a dynamic programming technique. Next, on the negative side, we show that the minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set problem on circle graphs is $NP$-complete.</description>

      <title>Fundamental computational limits of weak learnability in high-dimensional multi-index models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-index models - functions which only depend on the covariates through a non-linear transformation of their projection on a subspace - are a useful benchmark for investigating feature learning with neural networks. This paper examines the theoretical boundaries of efficient learnability in this hypothesis class, focusing particularly on the minimum sample complexity required for weakly recovering their low-dimensional structure with first-order iterative algorithms, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples is $n=\alpha d$ is proportional to the covariate dimension $d$. Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) first, we identify under which conditions a trivial subspace can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha\!&gt;\!0$; (ii) second, in the case where the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an easy subspace consisting of directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha\!&gt;\!\alpha_c$. The critical threshold $\alpha_{c}$ marks the presence of a computational phase transition, in the sense that it is conjectured that no efficient iterative algorithm can succeed for $\alpha\!&lt;\!\alpha_c$. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions - akin to the parity problem - $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we demonstrate that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where some directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. Our analytical approach is built on the optimality of approximate message-passing algorithms among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent.</description>
