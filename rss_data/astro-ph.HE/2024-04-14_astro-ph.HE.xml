      <title>The origin of the coherent radio flash potentially associated with GRB 201006A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rowlinson et al. 2023 recently claimed the detection of a coherent radio flash 76.6 minutes after a short gamma-ray burst. They proposed that the radio emission may be associated with a long-lived neutron star engine. We show through theoretical and observational arguments that the coherent radio emission, if real and indeed associated with GRB 201006A and at the estimated redshift, is unlikely to be due to the collapse of the neutron star, ruling out a blitzar-like mechanism. Instead, we show if a long-lived engine was created, it must have been stable with the radio emission likely linked to the intrinsic magnetar activity. However, we find that the optical upper limits require fine-tuning to be consistent with a magnetar-driven kilonova: we show that neutron-star engines that do satisfy the optical constraints would have produced a bright kilonova afterglow that should already be observable by the VLA or MeerKAT (for ambient densities typical for short GRBs). Given the optical limits and the current lack of a kilonova afterglow, we instead posit that no neutron star survived the merger, and the coherent radio emission was produced far from a black hole central engine via mechanisms such as synchrotron maser or magnetic reconnection in the jet -- a scenario consistent with all observations. We encourage future radio follow-up to probe the engine of this exciting event and continued prompt radio follow-up of short GRBs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Primordial Black Hole Capture by Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor, Full Momentum Space Neutrino Spin Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of anisotropic neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, the quantum kinetic equations drive coherent oscillations in neutrino helicity, frequently referred to as spin oscillations. These oscillations depend directly on the absolute mass scale and Majorana phase, but are usually too transient to produce important effects. In this paper we present a full momentum-space analysis of Majorana neutrino spin oscillations in a snapshot of a three-dimensional neutron star merger simulation. We find an interesting angular dependence that allows for that resonant and adiabatic oscillations to occur along specific directions in a large volume of the merger remnant. The solid angle spanned by these directions is extremely narrow in general. We then analyze spin transformation in the presence of flavor transformation by characterizing how the effect's resonance and timescale change during a fast flavor instability. For this analysis, we derive a generalized resonance condition that poses a restrictive requirement for resonance to exist in any flavor channel. We determine that spin oscillations at all locations in the merger snapshot have a length scale that is too large for significant oscillations to be expected even where there exist resonant and adiabatic directions.</description>

      <title>Sizes of active galactic nuclei inhomogeneous disks -- large in microlensing, small in reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence can drive significant temperature fluctuations in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). As a result, the disk can be highly inhomogeneous and has a half-light radius larger than the static Shakura \&amp; Sunyaev Disk (SSD), in agreement with quasar microlensing observations. Meanwhile, the accretion-disk sizes can also be determined using continuum reverberation mappings which measure interband cross correlations and time lags. The interband time lags are often understood in the X-ray reprocessing scenario. Here we show that the interband continuum time lags of the X-ray reprocessing of an inhomogeneous disk are similar to or even smaller than those of a static SSD. Consequently, the X-ray reprocessing of an inhomogeneous disk cannot account for the recent continuum reverberation mappings of some Seyfert 1 AGNs, whose measured time lags are larger than those of a static SSD. In contrast to the tight correlation between UV/optical variations, the cross correlation between X-ray and disk emission is rather weak in this model; this behavior is consistent with recent continuum reverberation mappings. Moreover, the time lags in this model are anti-correlated with the amplitude of disk temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that the temperature fluctuations should be properly considered when modeling interband continuum time lags.</description>

      <title>An XRISM observation proposal: Gas velocity in the merging cluster Abell 2256</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the XRISM mission goals is to measure the gas dynamics of galaxy clusters with Resolve spectroscopy. To archive these, we propose an observation of the X-ray bright galaxy cluster Abell 2256 at z=0.06. This hosts 2nd brightest diffuse radio relic. Suzaku revealed a gas bulk motion at 1500 km/s, for the first time i\ n a cluster. This X-ray gas velocity is consistent with those measured in galaxy velocities, indicating that gas and galaxies are moving together. These and other observations make this system the most suitable for the XRISM spectral mapping of gas bulk and tur\ bulent motions and related physics. We propose two pointings to cover the central ~400kpc region.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the gamma-ray counterpart from nova FM Cir with F ermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the analysis results of X-ray and gamma-ray data of the nova FM Cir taken by Swift and Fermi-LAT. The gamma-ray emission from FM Cir can be identified with a significance level of 3sigma within 40 days after the nova eruption (2018 January 19) while we bin the light curve per day. The significance can further exceed 4 sigma confidence level if we accumulate longer time (i.e., 20 days) to bin the light curve. The gamma-ray counterpart could be identified with a Test Statistic (TS) above 4 until 180 days after the eruption. The duration of the gamma-ray detection was longer than those reported in the previous studies of the other novae detected in the GeV range. The significant X-ray emission was observed after the gamma-ray flux level fell below the sensitivity of Fermi-LAT. The hardness ratio of the X-ray emission decreased rapidly with time, and the spectra were dominated by blackbody radiation from the hot white dwarf. Except for the longer duration of the gamma-ray emission, the multi-wavelength properties of FM Cir closely resemble those of other novae detected in the GeV range.</description>

      <title>Fast giant flares in discs around supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal stability of non-self-gravitating turbulent $\alpha$ discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to test a new type of high-amplitude active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares. On calculating discs structures, we compute the critical points of stability curves for discs around SMBH, which cover a wide range of accretion rates and resemble the shape of a $\xi$ curve. We find that there are values of the disc parameters that favour the transition of a disc ring from a recombined cool state to a hot, fully ionised, advection dominated, geometrically thick state with higher viscosity parameter $\alpha$. For SMBH with masses $\sim 10^6-10^8 M_\odot$, such a flare can occur in the geometrically thin and optically thick neutral disc with convective energy transfer through the disc thickness surrounding a radiatively inefficient accretion flow. When self-gravity effects are negligible, the duration of a flare and the associated mass exhibit a positive correlation with the truncation radius of the geometrically thin disc prior to the flare. According to our rough estimates, $\sim 4-3000 M_\odot$ can be involved in a giant flare, i.e. can be accreted or entrained with an outflow lasting 1 to 400 years, if the flare is triggered somewhere between $60$ and $600$ gravitational radii in a disc around SMBH with $10^7 M_\odot$. The accretion rate on SMBH peaks at a super-Eddington value about ten times faster. The peak effective disc temperature at the trigger radius is $\sim 10^5\,$K, but it can be obscured by an optically thick outflow that reprocesses the emission to longer wavelengths. Such a transfer of disc state could trigger a massive outburst, similar to that following a tidal disruption event.</description>

      <title>The role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration in the inner jets of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution radio observations of nearby active galactic nuclei have revealed extended, limb-brightened structures in their inner jets. This ties in with other multi-wavelength observations from radio to X-ray and gamma-ray, indicating that a structured jet model is required. While electrons need to be kept energized to account for the observed features, the underlying particle acceleration mechanism is still unclear. We explore the role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration, i.e., classical second-order Fermi and shear acceleration, for understanding the multi-wavelength observations of the inner jets of M87. An analytical Fokker-Planck description is adopted to infer characteristic spectral indices and cutoff energies for these two mechanisms. We focus on electron synchrotron radiation as the dominant emission process. We find that the multi-wavelength observations of M87 can be satisfactorily accounted for in a framework, where the X-rays are produced at a larger distance from the core than the radio emission region. This provides further support to multi-zone, broadband emission modelling. We use our findings to also comment on the acceleration of cosmic rays entrained in the sheath.</description>

      <title>See the lightning, hear the thunder: quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the ``thunder'') and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the ``lightning'') BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Binaries Embedded Within Common Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple star-systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This letter examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single object case. We find that for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to be disrupted by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple star-systems.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Binary Formation in Clusters: Analytical Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary formation in clusters through triple encounters between three unbound stars, 'three-body' binary formation, is one of the main dynamical formation processes of binary systems in dense environments. In this paper, we use an analytical probabilistic approach to study the process for the equal mass case and calculate a probability distribution for the orbital parameters of three-body-formed binaries, as well as their formation rate. For the first time, we give closed-form analytical expressions to the full orbital parameter distribution, accounting for both energy and angular momentum conservation. This calculation relies on the sensitive dependence of the outcomes of three-body scatterings on the initial conditions: here we compute the rate of three-body binaries from ergodic interactions, which allow for an analytical derivation of the distribution of orbital parameters of the binaries thus created. We find that soft binaries are highly favoured in this process and that these binaries have a super-thermal eccentricity distribution, while the few hard three-body binaries have an eccentricity distribution much closer to thermal. The analytical results predict and reproduce simulation results of three-body scattering experiments in the literature well.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE III: The IMF in Quasar Accretion Disks from STARFORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations, including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches) in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then dynamically decouple from the gas and 'wander,' ceasing accretion on timescales ~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are 'swept up' into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as the global dynamical times can become incredibly short (&lt; yr) and tidal fields are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular momentum or fragment catastrophically at &lt;10 au scales requires novel PSD simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs, though we discuss a couple of viable models.</description>

      <title>Observational Tests of Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback: An Overview of Approaches and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing supermassive black holes (Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN) release energy with the potential to alter their host galaxies and larger-scale environment; a process named "AGN feedback". Feedback is a required component of galaxy formation models and simulations to explain observed properties of galaxy populations. We provide a broad overview of observational approaches that are designed to establish the physical processes that couple AGN energy to the multi-phase gas, or to find evidence that AGN impact upon galaxy evolution. The orders-of-magnitude range in spatial, temporal, and temperature scales, requires a diverse set of observational studies. For example, studying individual targets in detail sheds light on coupling mechanisms; however, evidence for long-term impact of AGN is better established within galaxy populations that are not necessarily currently active. We emphasise how modern surveys have revealed the importance of radio emission for identifying, and characterising, feedback mechanisms. At the achieved sensitivities, the detected radio emission can trace a range of processes, including shocked interstellar medium caused by AGN outflows (driven by various mechanisms including radiation pressure, accretion disc winds, and jets). We also describe how interpreting observations in the context of theoretical work can be challenging, in part, due to some of the adopted terminology.</description>

      <title>Studying Binary Formation under Dynamical Friction Using Hill's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the equations of motion from Hill's problem, with added accelerations for different forms of dynamical friction, we provide the (to-date) broadest scale-free study of friction-driven binary formation in gaseous disks and stellar clusters. We focus mainly on binary formation between stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNi), considering both gas dynamical friction from AGN disks and stellar dynamical friction from the nuclear star cluster. We first find simple, dimensionless friction coefficients that approximate the effects of standard models for gas and stellar dynamical friction. We perform extensive simulations of Hill's problem under such friction, and we present a picture of binary formation through encounters between single stars on nearby orbits, as a function of friction parameter, eccentricity, and inclination. Notably, we find that the local binary formation rate is a linear function of the friction coefficient so long as the friction is weak. Due to the dimensionless nature of our model problem, our findings are generalizable to binary formation at all scales (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes in a star cluster, planetesimals in a gaseous disk).</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW), emanating from binary black holes (BBH), encode vital information about their source. GW signals enable us to deduce key properties of the BBH population across the universe, including mass, spin, and eccentricity distribution. While the masses and spins of binary components are already recognized for their insights into formation, eccentricity stands out as a distinct and quantifiable indicator of formation and evolution. Yet, despite its significance, eccentricity is notably absent from most parameter estimation (PE) analyses associated with GW signals. To evaluate the precision with which the eccentricity distribution can be deduced, we generated two synthetic populations of eccentric binary black holes (EBBH) characterized by non-spinning, non-precessing dynamics and mass ranges between $10 M_\odot$ and $50 M_\odot$. This was achieved using an eccentric power law model, encompassing $100$ events with eccentricity distributions set at $\sigma_\epsilon = 0.05$ and $\sigma_\epsilon = 0.15$. This synthetic EBBH ensemble was contrasted against a circular binary black holes (CBBH) collection to discern how parameter inferences would vary without eccentricity. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, we constrained vital model parameters, including the event rate ($\mathcal{R}$), mass distribution, minimum mass ($m_{min}$), maximum mass ($m_{max}$), and the eccentricity distribution ($\sigma_\epsilon$). Our analysis demonstrates that eccentric population inference can identify the signatures of even modest eccentricities, given sufficiently many events. Conversely, our study shows that an analysis neglecting eccentricity may draw biased conclusions about population parameters for populations with the optimistic values of eccentricity distribution used in our research.</description>

      <title>Formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the theory behind the formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates. We consider the binary formation in the early and late Universe, emphasising the former as it gives the dominant contribution of the present primordial black hole merger rate. The binaries formed in the early Universe are highly eccentric and get easily disrupted by interactions with other primordial black holes. We discuss in detail how the suppression of the merger rate arising from such interactions can be estimated and how such interactions lead to the formation of another, much harder, binary population that contributes to the present merger rate if more than 10% of dark matter consists of primordial black holes with a narrow mass distribution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves for eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals of self-dual spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the frequencies of geodesic orbits in self-dual spacetime on the equatorial plane and obtain the leading-order effects of loop quantum parameters $P$ on the energy flux and angular momentum flux in eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals. The gravitational waveform under different eccentricity is carried out by improved "analytic-kludge" method. Through the calculation of waveform mismatches for the LISA detector, the constraints on loop quantum parameters will be improved by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, compared to the weak field experiments in the solar system, and can reach the level of $10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Echoes of darkness: Supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter from all galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that the boosted dark matter (BDM) by supernova neutrinos (SN$\nu$) from SN1987a or from the next galactic SN can serve as a novel component to probe nonvanishing interaction between DM and the Standard Model leptons. In this work, we extend this concept and evaluate the present-day diffuse flux of SN$\nu$ BDM originated from all galaxies at higher redshifts. We show that by considering this diffuse BDM (DBDM) component, the best model-independent sensitivity on the product of the DM-$\nu$ and DM-electron cross sections, $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi\nu}\sigma_{\chi e}}\simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{-37})$~cm$^2$ for sub-MeV DM, can be obtained with large-size neutrino experiments such as Super-Kamiokande or Hyper-Kamiokande, surpassing the estimated SN$\nu$ BDM bound from SN1987a. We also examine the impact due to the presence of DM spikes around the supermassive black holes in galaxies on SN$\nu$ BDM and DBDM. Our results suggest that both the DBDM and the SN$\nu$ BDM probes are insensitive to the uncertain properties of DM spikes, unless the next galactic SN happens to occur at a location extremely close to or right behind the galactic center along the SN line of sight.</description>

      <title>Analytic approximations for massive close post-mass transfer binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive binary evolution models are needed to predict massive star populations in star forming galaxies, the supernova diversity, and the number and properties of gravitational wave sources. Such models are often computed using so called rapid binary evolution codes, which approximate the evolution of the binary components based on detailed single star models. However, about one third of the interacting massive binary stars undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning (Case A mass transfer), whose outcome is difficult to derive from single star models. Here, we use a large grid of detailed binary evolution models for primaries in the initial mass range 10 to 40 Solar masses of LMC and SMC composition, to derive analytic fits for the key quantities needed in rapid binary evolution codes, i.e., the duration of core hydrogen burning, and the resulting donor star mass. Systems with shorter orbital periods produce up to 50% lighter stripped donors and have a up to 30% larger lifetime than wider systems. We find that both quantities depend strongly on the initial binary orbital period, but that the initial mass ratio and the mass transfer efficiency of the binary have little impact on the outcome. Our results are easily parameterisable and can be used to capture the effects of Case A mass transfer more accurately in rapid binary evolution codes.</description>

Abstract: We present a catalog of likely astrophysical neutrino track-like events from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. IceCube began reporting likely astrophysical neutrinos in 2016 and this system was updated in 2019. The catalog presented here includes events that were reported in real-time since 2019, as well as events identified in archival data samples starting from 2011. We report 275 neutrino events from two selection channels as the first entries in the catalog, the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks, which will see ongoing extensions with additional alerts. The gold and bronze alert channels respectively provide neutrino candidates with 50\% and 30\% probability of being astrophysical, on average assuming an astrophysical neutrino power law energy spectral index of 2.19. For each neutrino alert, we provide the reconstructed energy, direction, false alarm rate, probability of being astrophysical in origin, and likelihood contours describing the spatial uncertainty in the alert's reconstructed location. We also investigate a directional correlation of these neutrino events with gamma-ray and X-ray catalogs including 4FGL, 3HWC, TeVCat and Swift-BAT.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger prospects for black hole - neutron star mergers in the O4 and O5 runs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of merging black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries has been ascertained through the observation of their gravitational wave (GW) signals. However, to date, no definitive electromagnetic (EM) emission has been confidently associated with these mergers. Such an association could help unravel crucial information on these systems, for example, their BH spin distribution, the equation of state (EoS) of NS and the rate of heavy element production. We model the multi-messenger (MM) emission from BHNS mergers detectable during the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GW detector network, in order to provide detailed predictions that can help enhance the effectiveness of observational efforts and extract the highest possible scientific information from such remarkable events. Our methodology is based on a population synthesis-approach, which includes the modelling of the signal-to-noise ratio of the GW signal in the detectors, the GW-inferred sky localization of the source, the kilonova (KN) optical and near-infrared light curves, the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission peak photon flux, and the GRB afterglow light curves in the radio, optical and X-ray bands. The resulting prospects for BHNS MM detections during O4 are not promising, with a GW detection rate of $15.0^{+15.4}_{-8.8}$ yr$^{-1}$, but joint MM rates of $\sim 10^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the KN and $\sim 10^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the jet-related emission. In O5 we find an overall increase in expected detection rates by around an order of magnitude, owing to both the enhanced sensitivity of the GW detector network, and the coming online of future EM facilities. Finally, we discuss direct searches for the GRB radio afterglow with large-field-of-view instruments as a new possible follow-up strategy in the context of ever-dimming prospects for KN detection.</description>

      <title>Hot Gas Outflow Properties of the Starburst Galaxy NGC 4945</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze 330 ks of {\it Chandra} X-ray imaging and spectra of the nearby, edge-on starburst and Seyfert Type 2 galaxy NGC 4945 to measure the hot gas properties along the galactic outflows. We extract and model spectra from 15 regions extending from $-$0.55 kpc to $+$0.85 kpc above and below the galactic disk to determine the best-fit parameters and metal abundances. We find that the hot gas temperatures and number densities peak in the central regions and decrease along the outflows. These profiles are inconsistent with a spherical, adiabatically-expanding wind model, suggesting the need to include mass loading and/or a non-spherical outflow geometry. We estimate the mass outflow rate of the hot wind to be $1.6\:M_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Emission from charge exchange is detected in the northern outflow, and we estimate it contributes 12\% to the emitted, broad-band ($0.5-7$ keV) X-ray flux.</description>

      <title>A new solution of the pulsar equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first new type of solution of the pulsar equation since 1999. In it, the whole magnetosphere is confined inside the light cylinder and an electrically charged layer wraps around it and holds it together. The reason this new solution has never been obtained before is that all current time-dependent simulations are initialized with a vacuum dipole configuration that extends to infinity, thus their final steady-state solution also extends to infinity. Under special conditions, such a confined configuration may be attained when the neutron star first forms in the interior of a collapsing star during a supernova explosion, or when it accretes from an external wind or disk from a donor star. It is shown that this new maximally closed non-decelerating solution is the limit of a continuous sequence of standard magnetospheres with open and closed field lines when the amount of open field lines gradually drops to zero. The minimum energy solution in this sequence is a standard magnetosphere in which the closed field line region extends up to about 80% of the light cylinder. We estimate that the released energy when the new solution transitions to the minimum energy one is enough to power a fast radio burst.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the impact and signature of black holes from different origins in early cosmic history</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use semi-analytical models to study the effects of primordial black hole (PBH) accretion on the cosmic radiation background during the epoch of reionization ($z\gtrsim 6$). We consider PBHs floating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), and located inside haloes, where star formation can occur. For stars with a mass $\gtrsim 25 \rm\ M_{\odot}$, formed in suitable host haloes, we assume they quickly burn out and form stellar remnant black holes (SRBHs). Since SRBHs also accrete material from their surroundings, we consider them to have similar radiation feedback as PBHs in the halo environment. To estimate the background radiation level more accurately, we take into account the impact of PBHs on structure formation, allowing an improved modeling of the halo mass function. We consider the radiation feedback from a broad suite of black holes: PBHs, SRBHs, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We find that at $z\gtrsim 30$, the radiation background energy density is generated by PBHs accreting in the IGM, whereas at lower redshifts, the accretion feedback power from haloes dominates. We also analyze the total power density by modeling the accretion spectral energy distribution (SED), and break it down into select wavebands. In the UV band, we find that for $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$, the H-ionizing and Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes from PBH accretion feedback do not violate existing constraints on the timing of reionization, and on the effective Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the kinetic temperature of the IGM. However, in the X-ray band, with the same abundance, PBHs contribute significantly and could account for the unresolved part of the cosmic X-ray background.</description>

      <title>Horizon-penetrating form of parametrized metrics for static and stationary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rezzolla-Zhidenko (RZ) and Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) frameworks provide an efficient approach to characterize agnostically spherically symmetric or stationary black-hole spacetimes in arbitrary metric theories. In their original construction, these metrics were defined only in the spacetime region outside of the event horizon, where they can reproduce any black-hole metric with percent precision and a few parameters only. At the same time, numerical simulations of accreting black holes often require metric functions that are regular across the horizon, so that the inner boundary of the computational domain can be placed in a region that is causally disconnected from the exterior. We present a novel formulation of the RZ/KRZ parametrized metrics in coordinate systems that are regular at the horizon and defined everywhere in the interior. We compare the horizon-penetrating form of the KRZ and RZ metrics with the corresponding forms of the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild coordinates and of the Schwarzschild metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, remarking the similarities and differences. We expect the horizon-penetrating formulations of the RZ/KRZ metrics to represent new tools to study via simulations the physical processes that occur near the horizon of an arbitrary black hole.</description>
