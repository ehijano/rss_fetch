      <title>A Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC) for Irregular Data Transfers on RISC-V Linux Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-growing heterogeneity in computing systems, driven by modern machine learning applications, pressure is increasing on memory systems to handle arbitrary and more demanding transfers efficiently. Descriptor-based direct memory access controllers (DMACs) allow such transfers to be executed by decoupling memory transfers from processing units. Classical descriptor-based DMACs are inefficient when handling arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes. Excessive descriptor size and the serialized nature of processing descriptors employed by the DMAC lead to large static overheads when setting up transfers. To tackle this inefficiency, we propose a descriptor-based DMAC optimized to efficiently handle arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes. We implement a lightweight descriptor format in an AXI4-based DMAC. We further increase performance by implementing a low-overhead speculative descriptor prefetching scheme without additional latency penalties in the case of a misprediction. Our DMAC is integrated into a 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V SoC and emulated on a Kintex FPGA to evaluate its performance. Compared to an off-the-shelf descriptor-based DMAC IP, we achieve 1.66x less latency launching transfers, increase bus utilization up to 2.5x in an ideal memory system with 64-byte-length transfers while requiring 11% fewer lookup tables, 23% fewer flip-flops, and no block RAMs. We can extend our lead in bus utilization to 3.6x with 64-byte-length transfers in deep memory systems. We synthesized our DMAC in GlobalFoundries' GF12LP+ node, achieving a clock frequency of over 1.44 GHz while occupying only 49.5 kGE.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Coding for Accommodation-Invariant Near-Eye Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new computational near-eye display method that addresses the vergence-accommodation conflict problem in stereoscopic displays through accommodation-invariance. Our system integrates a refractive lens eyepiece with a novel wavefront coding diffractive optical element, operating in tandem with a pre-processing convolutional neural network. We employ end-to-end learning to jointly optimize the wavefront-coding optics and the image pre-processing module. To implement this approach, we develop a differentiable retinal image formation model that accounts for limiting aperture and chromatic aberrations introduced by the eye optics. We further integrate the neural transfer function and the contrast sensitivity function into the loss model to account for related perceptual effects. To tackle off-axis distortions, we incorporate position dependency into the pre-processing module. In addition to conducting rigorous analysis based on simulations, we also fabricate the designed diffractive optical element and build a benchtop setup, demonstrating accommodation-invariance for depth ranges of up to four diopters.</description>
