      <title>Map-Matching Queries under Fr\'echet Distance on Low-Density Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Map matching is a common task when analysing GPS tracks, such as vehicle trajectories. The goal is to match a recorded noisy polygonal curve to a path on the map, usually represented as a geometric graph. The Fr\'echet distance is a commonly used metric for curves, making it a natural fit. The map-matching problem is well-studied, yet until recently no-one tackled the data structure question: preprocess a given graph so that one can query the minimum Fr\'echet distance between all graph paths and a polygonal curve. Recently, Gudmundsson, Seybold, and Wong [SODA 2023, arXiv:2211.02951] studied this problem for arbitrary query polygonal curves and $c$-packed graphs. In this paper, we instead require the graphs to be $\lambda$-low-density $t$-spanners, which is significantly more representative of real-world networks. We also show how to report a path that minimises the distance efficiently rather than only returning the minimal distance, which was stated as an open problem in their paper.</description>

      <title>A simple linear time algorithm for smallest enclosing circles on the (hemi)sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on Welzl's algorithm for smallest circles and spheres we develop a simple linear time algorithm for finding the smallest circle enclosing a point cloud on a sphere. The algorithm yields correct results as long as the point cloud is contained in a hemisphere, but the hemisphere does not have to be known in advance and the algorithm automatically detects whether the hemisphere assumption is met.
  For the full-sphere case, that is, if the point cloud is not contained in a hemisphere, we provide hints on how to adapt existing linearithmic time algorithms for spherical Voronoi diagrams to find the smallest enclosing circle.</description>

      <title>Obstacle-Aware Length-Matching Routing for Any-Direction Traces in Printed Circuit Board</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging applications in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) routing impose new challenges on automatic length matching, including adaptability for any-direction traces with their original routing preserved for interactiveness. The challenges can be addressed through two orthogonal stages: assign non-overlapping routing regions to each trace and meander the traces within their regions to reach the target length. In this paper, mainly focusing on the meandering stage, we propose an obstacle-aware detailed routing approach to optimize the utilization of available space and achieve length matching while maintaining the original routing of traces. Furthermore, our approach incorporating the proposed Multi-Scale Dynamic Time Warping (MSDTW) method can also handle differential pairs against common decoupled problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach has effective length-matching routing ability and compares favorably to previous approaches under more complicated constraints.</description>

      <title>A face cover perspective to $\ell_1$ embeddings of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.02758v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Gupta et al. [Combinatorica04] that every planar graph can be embedded into $\ell_1$ with constant distortion. However, given an $n$-vertex weighted planar graph, the best upper bound on the distortion is only $O(\sqrt{\log n})$, by Rao [SoCG99]. In this paper we study the case where there is a set $K$ of terminals, and the goal is to embed only the terminals into $\ell_1$ with low distortion. In a seminal paper, Okamura and Seymour [J.Comb.Theory81] showed that if all the terminals lie on a single face, they can be embedded isometrically into $\ell_1$. The more general case, where the set of terminals can be covered by $\gamma$ faces, was studied by Lee and Sidiropoulos [STOC09] and Chekuri et al. [J.Comb.Theory13]. The state of the art is an upper bound of $O(\log \gamma)$ by Krauthgamer, Lee and Rika [SODA19]. Our contribution is a further improvement on the upper bound to $O(\sqrt{\log\gamma})$. Since every planar graph has at most $O(n)$ faces, any further improvement on this result, will be a major breakthrough, directly improving upon Rao's long standing upper bound. Moreover, it is well known that the flow-cut gap equals to the distortion of the best embedding into $\ell_1$. Therefore, our result provides a polynomial time $O(\sqrt{\log \gamma})$-approximation to the sparsest cut problem on planar graphs, for the case where all the demand pairs can be covered by $\gamma$ faces.</description>

      <title>Topological Drawings meet Classical Theorems from Convex Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.12568v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we discuss classical theorems from Convex Geometry in the context of topological drawings and beyond. In a simple topological drawing of the complete graph $K_n$, any two edges share at most one point: either a common vertex or a point where they cross. Triangles of simple topological drawings can be viewed as convex sets. This gives a link to convex geometry.
  As our main result, we present a generalization of Kirchberger's Theorem that is of purely combinatorial nature. It turned out that this classical theorem also applies to "generalized signotopes" - a combinatorial generalization of simple topological drawings, which we introduce and investigate in the course of this article. As indicated by the name they are a generalization of signotopes, a structure studied in the context of encodings for arrangements of pseudolines.
  We also present a family of simple topological drawings with arbitrarily large Helly number, and a new proof of a topological generalization of Carath\'{e}odory's Theorem in the plane and discuss further classical theorems from Convex Geometry in the context of simple topological drawings.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of $k$-complexes in $2k$-manifolds and minimum rank of partial symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex having $n$ faces of dimension $k$, and $M$ a closed $(k-1)$-connected PL $2k$-dimensional manifold. We prove that for $k\ge3$ odd $K$ embeds into $M$ if and only if there are
  $\bullet$ a skew-symmetric $n\times n$-matrix $A$ with $\mathbb Z$-entries whose rank over $\mathbb Q$ does not exceed $rk H_k(M;\mathbb Z)$,
  $\bullet$ a general position PL map $f:K\to\mathbb R^{2k}$, and
  $\bullet$ a collection of orientations on $k$-faces of $K$ such that for any nonadjacent $k$-faces $\sigma,\tau$ of $K$ the element $A_{\sigma,\tau}$ equals to the algebraic intersection of $f\sigma$ and $f\tau$.
  We prove some analogues of this result including those for $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability. Our results generalize the Bikeev-Fulek-Kyn\v cl-Schaefer-Stefankovi\v c criteria for the $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability of graphs to surfaces, and are related to the Harris-Krushkal-Johnson-Pat\'ak-Tancer criteria for the embeddability of $k$-complexes into $2k$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Programming Algorithms for Convex Hull Approximation with a Hyperplane Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following problem in computational geometry: given, in the d-dimensional real space, a set of points marked as positive and a set of points marked as negative, such that the convex hull of the positive set does not intersect the negative set, find K hyperplanes that separate, if possible, all the positive points from the negative ones. That is, we search for a convex polyhedron with at most K faces, containing all the positive points and no negative point. The problem is known in the literature for pure convex polyhedral approximation; our interest stems from its possible applications in constraint learning, where points are feasible or infeasible solutions of a Mixed Integer Program, and the K hyperplanes are linear constraints to be found. We cast the problem as an optimization one, minimizing the number of negative points inside the convex polyhedron, whenever exact separation cannot be achieved. We introduce models inspired by support vector machines and we design two mathematical programming formulations with binary variables. We exploit Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to obtain extended formulations, and we devise column generation algorithms with ad-hoc pricing routines. We compare computing time and separation error values obtained by all our approaches on synthetic datasets, with number of points from hundreds up to a few thousands, showing our approaches to perform better than existing ones from the literature. Furthermore, we observe that key computational differences arise, depending on whether the budget K is sufficient to completely separate the positive points from the negative ones or not. On 8-dimensional instances (and over), existing convex hull algorithms become computational inapplicable, while our algorithms allow to identify good convex hull approximations in minutes of computation.</description>
