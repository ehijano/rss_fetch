      <title>FloRa: Flow Table Low-Rate Overflow Reconnaissance and Detection in SDN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software Defined Networking (SDN) has evolved to revolutionize next-generation networks, offering programmability for on-the-fly service provisioning, primarily supported by the OpenFlow (OF) protocol. The limited storage capacity of Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) for storing flow tables in OF switches introduces vulnerabilities, notably the Low-Rate Flow Table Overflow (LOFT) attacks. LOFT exploits the flow table's storage capacity by occupying a substantial amount of space with malicious flow, leading to a gradual degradation in the flow-forwarding performance of OF switches. To mitigate this threat, we propose FloRa, a machine learning-based solution designed for monitoring and detecting LOFT attacks in SDN. FloRa continuously examines and determines the status of the flow table by closely examining the features of the flow table entries. Upon detecting an attack FloRa promptly activates the detection module. The module monitors flow properties, identifies malicious flows, and blacklists them, facilitating their eviction from the flow table. Incorporating novel features such as Packet Arrival Frequency, Content Relevance Score, and Possible Spoofed IP along with Cat Boost employed as the attack detection method. The proposed method reduces CPU overhead, memory overhead, and classification latency significantly and achieves a detection accuracy of 99.49%, which is more than the state-of-the-art methods to the best of our knowledge. This approach not only protects the integrity of the flow tables but also guarantees the uninterrupted flow of legitimate traffic. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of FloRa in LOFT attack detection, ensuring uninterrupted data forwarding and continuous availability of flow table resources in SDN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given rise to a new paradigm known as the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of AIoT research. We examine AIoT literature related to sensing, computing, and networking &amp; communication, which form the three key components of AIoT. In addition to advancements in these areas, we review domain-specific AIoT systems that are designed for various important application domains. We have also created an accompanying GitHub repository, where we compile the papers included in this survey: https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/AIoT-Survey. This repository will be actively maintained and updated with new research as it becomes available. As both IoT and AI become increasingly critical to our society, we believe AIoT is emerging as an essential research field at the intersection of IoT and modern AI. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource for those engaged in AIoT research and act as a catalyst for future explorations to bridge gaps and drive advancements in this exciting field.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin-based Intelligent Network Architecture for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) drive toward strong environmental adaptability, intelligence, and multifunctionality. However, due to unique UASN characteristics, such as long propagation delay, dynamic channel quality, and high attenuation, existing studies present untimeliness, inefficiency, and inflexibility in real practice. Digital twin (DT) technology is promising for UASNs to break the above bottlenecks by providing high-fidelity status prediction and exploring optimal schemes. In this article, we propose a Digital Twin-based Network Architecture (DTNA), enhancing UASNs' environmental adaptability, intelligence, and multifunctionality. By extracting real UASN information from local (node) and global (network) levels, we first design a layered architecture to improve the DT replica fidelity and UASN control flexibility. In local DT, we develop a resource allocation paradigm (RAPD), which rapidly perceives performance variations and iteratively optimizes allocation schemes to improve real-time environmental adaptability of resource allocation algorithms. In global DT, we aggregate decentralized local DT data and propose a collaborative Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework (CMFD) and a task-oriented network slicing (TNSD). CMFD patches scarce real data and provides extensive DT data to accelerate AI model training. TNSD unifies heterogeneous tasks' demand extraction and efficiently provides comprehensive network status, improving the flexibility of multi-task scheduling algorithms. Finally, practical and simulation experiments verify the high fidelity of DT. Compared with the original UASN architecture, experiment results demonstrate that DTNA can: (i) improve the timeliness and robustness of resource allocation; (ii) greatly reduce the training time of AI algorithms; (iii) more rapidly obtain network status for multi-task scheduling at a low cost.</description>

      <title>MPLS Network Actions: Technological Overview and P4-Based Implementation on a High-Speed Switching ASIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MPLS protocol, traditionally focused on packet forwarding using labels, has evolved to include advanced mechanisms such as Service Function Chaining (SFC), Alternate-Marking Method (AMM), and in-situ OAM (IOAM). However, many of those mechanisms require extensions to existing specifications in MPLS making them difficult to deploy. To bridge this gap, the IETF MPLS WG proposed the MPLS Network Actions (MNA) framework which provides a unified encoding for signaling network actions and their data within the MPLS stack. Network actions in the MNA framework serve a similar role for MPLS as extension headers (EH) do for IPv6. The network actions can be encoded within the label stack (in-stack) or following the stack (post-stack). In this work, we give a comprehensive overview of the design principles of network actions in the MNA framework and the mechanisms that benefit from this framework. We summarize and explain use cases in the MNA framework. Building on this, we implement the MNA framework in P4 on the Intel Tofino 2 switching ASIC. Our work explores an in-stack data (ISD) implementation of the MNA framework. The implementation can process 51 label stack entries containing 32 network actions at a line rate of 400 Gb/s per port. Additionally, we implement and evaluate an exemplary network action for performance measurement with AMM. Finally, we identify challenges with an MNA in-stack implementation and propose an extension to the signaling procedure.</description>

      <title>ReACKed QUICer: Measuring the Performance of Instant Acknowledgments in QUIC Handshakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed performance analysis of QUIC instant ACK, a standard-compliant approach to reduce waiting times during the QUIC connection setup in common CDN deployments. To understand the root causes of the performance properties, we combine numerical analysis and the emulation of eight QUIC implementations using the QUIC Interop Runner. Our experiments comprehensively cover packet loss and non-loss scenarios, different round trip times, and TLS certificate sizes. To clarify instant ACK deployments in the wild, we conduct active measurements of 1M popular domain names. For almost all domain names under control of Cloudflare, Cloudflare uses instant ACK, which in fact improves performance. We also find, however, that instant ACK may lead to unnecessary retransmissions or longer waiting times under some network conditions, raising awareness of drawbacks of instant ACK in the future.</description>

      <title>Wireless-Friendly Window Position Optimization for RIS-Aided Outdoor-to-Indoor Networks based on Multi-Modal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to simultaneously optimize indoor wireless and daylight performance by adjusting the positions of windows and the beam directions of window-deployed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for RIS-aided outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) networks utilizing large language models (LLM) as optimizers. Firstly, we illustrate the wireless and daylight system models of RIS-aided O2I networks and formulate a joint optimization problem to enhance both wireless traffic sum rate and daylight illumination performance. Then, we present a multi-modal LLM-based window optimization (LMWO) framework, accompanied by a prompt construction template to optimize the overall performance in a zero-shot fashion, functioning as both an architect and a wireless network planner. Finally, we analyze the optimization performance of the LMWO framework and the impact of the number of windows, room size, number of RIS units, and daylight factor. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LMWO framework can achieve outstanding optimization performance in terms of initial performance, convergence speed, final outcomes, and time complexity, compared with classic optimization methods. The building's wireless performance can be significantly enhanced while ensuring indoor daylight performance.</description>

      <title>Aqua-Sim Fourth Generation: Towards General and Intelligent Simulation for Underwater Acoustic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulators are essential to troubleshoot and optimize Underwater Acoustic Network (UAN) schemes (network protocols and communication technologies) before real field experiments. However, due to programming differences between the above two contents, most existing simulators concentrate on one while weakening the other, leading to non-generic simulations and biased performance results. Moreover, novel UAN schemes increasingly integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, yet existing simulators lack support for necessary AI frameworks, failing to train and evaluate these intelligent methods. On the other hand, these novel schemes consider more UAN characteristics involving more complex parameter configurations, which also challenges simulators in flexibility and fineness. To keep abreast of advances in UANs, we propose the Fourth Generation (FG) ns-3-based simulator Aqua-Sim~FG, enhancing the general and intelligent simulation ability. On the basis of retaining previous generations' functions, we design a new general architecture, which is compatible with various programming languages, including MATLAB, C++, and Python. In this way, Aqua-Sim~FG provides a general environment to simulate communication technologies, network protocols, and AI models simultaneously. In addition, we expand six new features from node and communication levels by considering the latest UAN methods' requirements, which enhances the simulation flexibility and fineness of Aqua-Sim~FG. Experimental results show that Aqua-Sim~FG can simulate UANs' performance realistically, reflect intelligent methods' problems in real-ocean scenarios, and provide more effective troubleshooting and optimization for actual UANs. The basic simulator is available at https://github.com/JLU-smartocean/aqua-sim-fg.</description>

      <title>Telco-DPR: A Hybrid Dataset for Evaluating Retrieval Models of 3GPP Technical Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Question-Answering (QA) system for the telecom domain using 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) technical documents. Alongside, a hybrid dataset, Telco-DPR, which consists of a curated 3GPP corpus in a hybrid format, combining text and tables, is presented. Additionally, the dataset includes a set of synthetic question/answer pairs designed to evaluate the retrieval performance of QA systems on this type of data. The retrieval models, including the sparse model, Best Matching 25 (BM25), as well as dense models, such as Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) and Dense Hierarchical Retrieval (DHR), are evaluated and compared using top-K accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The results show that DHR, a retriever model utilising hierarchical passage selection through fine-tuning at both the document and passage levels, outperforms traditional methods in retrieving relevant technical information, achieving a Top-10 accuracy of 86.2%. Additionally, the Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, used in the proposed QA system, is evaluated to demonstrate the benefits of using the hybrid dataset and the DHR. The proposed QA system, using the developed RAG model and the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-4, achieves a 14% improvement in answer accuracy, when compared to a previous benchmark on the same dataset.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Cellular Network Selector for Vehicle Teleoperations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote control of robotic systems, also known as teleoperation, is crucial for the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. It allows a remote operator to view live video from AVs and, in some cases, to make real-time decisions. The effectiveness of video-based teleoperation systems is heavily influenced by the quality of the cellular network and, in particular, its packet loss rate and latency. To optimize these parameters, an AV can be connected to multiple cellular networks and determine in real time over which cellular network each video packet will be transmitted. We present an algorithm, called Active Network Selector (ANS), which uses a time series machine learning approach for solving this problem. We compare ANS to a baseline non-learning algorithm, which is used today in commercial systems, and show that ANS performs much better, with respect to both packet loss and packet latency.</description>

      <title>SANSee: A Physical-layer Semantic-aware Networking Framework for Distributed Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contactless device-free wireless sensing has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential to support a wide range of immersive human-machine interactive applications using ubiquitously available radio frequency (RF) signals. Traditional approaches focus on developing a single global model based on a combined dataset collected from different locations. However, wireless signals are known to be location and environment specific. Thus, a global model results in inconsistent and unreliable sensing results. It is also unrealistic to construct individual models for all the possible locations and environmental scenarios. Motivated by the observation that signals recorded at different locations are closely related to a set of physical-layer semantic features, in this paper we propose SANSee, a semantic-aware networking-based framework for distributed wireless sensing. SANSee allows models constructed in one or a limited number of locations to be transferred to new locations without requiring any locally labeled data or model training. SANSee is built on the concept of physical-layer semantic-aware network (pSAN), which characterizes the semantic similarity and the correlations of sensed data across different locations. A pSAN-based zero-shot transfer learning solution is introduced to allow receivers in new locations to obtain location-specific models by directly aggregating the models trained by other receivers. We theoretically prove that models obtained by SANSee can approach the locally optimal models. Experimental results based on real-world datasets are used to verify that the accuracy of the transferred models obtained by SANSee matches that of the models trained by the locally labeled data based on supervised learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Automata Size Reduction by Procedure Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel paradigm for reducing the size of finite automata by compressing repeating sub-graphs. These repeating sub-graphs can be viewed as invocations of a single procedure. Instead of representing each invocation explicitly, they can be replaced by a single procedure that uses a small runtime memory to remember the call context. We elaborate on the technical details of a basic implementation of this idea, where the memory used by the procedures is a simple finite-state register. We propose methods for identifying repetitive sub-graphs, collapsing them into procedures, and measuring the resulting reduction in automata size. Already, this basic implementation of reduction by procedure finding yields practically relevant results, particularly in the context of FPGA-accelerated pattern matching, where automata size is a primary bottleneck. We achieve up-to 70% size reduction on automata that had already been minimized using the most advanced existing methods.</description>

      <title>FuseFL: One-Shot Federated Learning through the Lens of Causality with Progressive Model Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-shot Federated Learning (OFL) significantly reduces communication costs in FL by aggregating trained models only once. However, the performance of advanced OFL methods is far behind the normal FL. In this work, we provide a causal view to find that this performance drop of OFL methods comes from the isolation problem, which means that local isolatedly trained models in OFL may easily fit to spurious correlations due to the data heterogeneity. From the causal perspective, we observe that the spurious fitting can be alleviated by augmenting intermediate features from other clients. Built upon our observation, we propose a novel learning approach to endow OFL with superb performance and low communication and storage costs, termed as FuseFL. Specifically, FuseFL decomposes neural networks into several blocks, and progressively trains and fuses each block following a bottom-up manner for feature augmentation, introducing no additional communication costs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FuseFL outperforms existing OFL and ensemble FL by a significant margin. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that FuseFL supports high scalability of clients, heterogeneous model training, and low memory costs. Our work is the first attempt using causality to analyze and alleviate data heterogeneity of OFL.</description>

Abstract: Browser fingerprinting is the identification of a browser through the network traffic captured during communication between the browser and server. This can be done using the HTTP protocol, browser extensions, and other methods. This paper discusses browser fingerprinting using the HTTPS over TLS 1.3 protocol. The study observed that different browsers use a different number of messages to communicate with the server, and the length of messages also varies. To conduct the study, a network was set up using a UTM hypervisor with one virtual machine as the server and another as a VM with a different browser. The communication was captured, and it was found that there was a 30\%-35\% dissimilarity in the behavior of different browsers.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Policies in a Multi-Source Status Update System with Dedicated and Shared Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21246</link>

Abstract: Use of multi-path network topologies has become a prominent technique to assert timeliness in terms of age of information (AoI) and to improve resilience to link disruptions in communication systems. However, establishing multiple dedicated communication links among network nodes is a costly endeavor. Therefore, quite often, these secondary communication links are shared among multiple entities. Moreover, these multi-path networks come with the added challenge of out-of-order transmissions. In this paper, we study an amalgamation of the above two aspects, i.e., multi-path transmissions and link sharing. In contrast to the existing literature where the main focus has been scheduling multiple sources on a single shared server, we delve into the realm where each source sharing the shared server is also supplemented with its dedicated server so as to improve its timeliness. In this multi-path link sharing setting with generate-at-will transmissions, we first present the optimal probabilistic scheduler, and then propose several heuristic-based cyclic scheduling algorithms for the shared server, to minimize the weighted average age of information of the sources.</description>

      <title>P4-PSFP: P4-Based Per-Stream Filtering and Policing for Time-Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) extends Ethernet to enable real-time communication. In TSN, bounded latency and zero congestion-based packet loss are achieved through mechanisms such as the Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) for bandwidth shaping and the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) for traffic scheduling. Generally, TSN requires streams to be explicitly admitted before being transmitted. To ensure that admitted traffic conforms with the traffic descriptors indicated for admission control, Per-Stream Filtering and Policing (PSFP) has been defined. For credit-based metering, well-known token bucket policers are applied. However, time-based metering requires time-dependent switch behavior and time synchronization with sub-microsecond precision. While TSN-capable switches support various TSN traffic shaping mechanisms, a full implementation of PSFP is still not available. To bridge this gap, we present a P4-based implementation of PSFP on a 100 Gb/s per port hardware switch. We explain the most interesting aspects of the PSFP implementation whose code is available on GitHub. We demonstrate credit-based and time-based policing and synchronization capabilities to validate the functionality and effectiveness of P4-PSFP. The implementation scales up to 35840 streams depending on the stream identification method. P4-PSFP can be used in practice as long as appropriate TSN switches lack this function. Moreover, its implementation may be helpful for other P4-based hardware implementations that require time synchronization.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Spectrum Usage Consensus for Low-Earth-Orbit Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operators of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) non-geostationary satellite networks, also known as mega-constellations, are required by current regulations to share all available satellite spectrum. This paper proposes a consensus mechanism to facilitate spectrum sharing with accountability by multiple operators, a subset of which may even be adversarial. A distributed ledger is used to securely record and track the state of consensus on spectrum usage, including interference incidents and the corresponding responsible parties. A key challenge is that operators generally do not have initial agreement due to noise in their analog measurements. To address this, two categories of spectrum-sharing solutions are studied in detail. The first category employs an exact Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) agreement model; the second category utilizes an approximate BFT agreement model. Practical considerations were taken into account regarding the BFT agreements, substantiated by numerical findings on the feasibility of the proposed solutions within the context of non-geostationary orbit satellite networks (NGSO).</description>

      <title>SmartMME: Implementation of Base Station Switching Off Strategy in ns-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the landscape of next-generation cellular networks, a projected surge of over 12 billion subscriptions foreshadows a considerable upswing in the network's overall energy consumption. The proliferation of User Equipment (UE) drives this energy demand, urging 5G deployments to seek more energy-efficient methodologies. In this work, we propose SmartMME, as a pivotal solution aimed at optimizing Base Station (BS) energy usage. By harnessing and analyzing critical network states-such as UE connections, data traffic at individual UEs, and other pertinent metrics-our methodology intelligently orchestrates the BS's power states, making informed decisions on when to activate or deactivate the BS. This meticulous approach significantly curtails the network's overall energy consumption. In a bid to validate its efficiency, we seamlessly integrated our module into Network Simulator-3 (ns-3), conducting extensive testing to demonstrate its prowess in effectively managing and reducing net energy consumption. As advocates of collaborative progress, we've opted to open-source this module, inviting the engagement and feedback of the wider research community on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Resource-Aware Hierarchical Federated Learning in Wireless Video Caching Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backhaul traffic congestion caused by the video traffic of a few popular files can be alleviated by storing the to-be-requested content at various levels in wireless video caching networks. Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs). As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests. A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content. Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm. Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints. Our extensive simulation results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>DDPG-E2E: A Novel Policy Gradient Approach for End-to-End Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The End-to-end (E2E) learning-based approach has great potential to reshape the existing communication systems by replacing the transceivers with deep neural networks. To this end, the E2E learning approach needs to assume the availability of prior channel information to mathematically formulate a differentiable channel layer for the backpropagation (BP) of the error gradients, thereby jointly optimizing the transmitter and the receiver. However, accurate and instantaneous channel state information is hardly obtained in practical wireless communication scenarios. Moreover, the existing E2E learning-based solutions exhibit limited performance in data transmissions with large block lengths. In this article, these practical issues are addressed by our proposed deep deterministic policy gradient-based E2E communication system. In particular, the proposed solution utilizes a reward feedback mechanism to train both the transmitter and the receiver, which alleviates the information loss of error gradients during BP. In addition, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture is developed to mitigate the curse of dimensionality problem when transmitting messages with large block lengths. Extensive simulations then demonstrate that our proposed solution can not only jointly train the transmitter and the receiver simultaneously without requiring the prior channel knowledge but also can obtain significant performance improvement on block error rate compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Empowered Task Assignment in Aerial MEC Network: A Resource Coalition Cooperation Approach with Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the demands for ubiquitous communication and temporary edge computing in 6G networks, aerial mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. However, dynamic user requests pose challenges for task assignment strategies. Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply. Moreover, the resource mutual exclusion problem of dynamic task assignment has not been effectively solved. Toward this end, we introduce the digital twin (DT) into the aerial MEC network to study the resource coalition cooperation approach with the generative model (GM), which provides a preliminary coalition structure for the coalition game. Specifically, we propose a novel network framework that is composed of an application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. After that, the task assignment problem is simplified to convex optimization programming with linear constraints. And then, we also propose a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of energy consumption and utilization of resources.</description>

      <title>Beyond Data Points: Regionalizing Crowdsourced Latency Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant investments in access network infrastructure, universal access to high-quality Internet connectivity remains a challenge. Policymakers often rely on large-scale, crowdsourced measurement datasets to assess the distribution of access network performance across geographic areas. These decisions typically rest on the assumption that Internet performance is uniformly distributed within predefined social boundaries. However, this assumption may not be valid for two reasons: crowdsourced measurements often exhibit non-uniform sampling densities within geographic areas; and predefined social boundaries may not align with the actual boundaries of Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we present a spatial analysis on crowdsourced datasets for constructing stable boundaries for sampling Internet performance. We hypothesize that greater stability in sampling boundaries will reflect the true nature of Internet performance disparities than misleading patterns observed as a result of data sampling variations. We apply and evaluate a series of statistical techniques to: aggregate Internet performance over geographic regions; overlay interpolated maps with various sampling unit choices; and spatially cluster boundary units to identify contiguous areas with similar performance characteristics. We assess the effectiveness of the techniques we apply by comparing the similarity of the resulting boundaries for monthly samples drawn from the dataset. Our evaluation shows that the combination of techniques we apply achieves higher similarity compared to directly calculating central measures of network metrics over census tracts or neighborhood boundaries. These findings underscore the important role of spatial modeling in accurately assessing and optimizing the distribution of Internet performance, to inform policy, network operations, and long-term planning decisions.</description>
