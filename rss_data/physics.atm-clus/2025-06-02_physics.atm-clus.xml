      <title>Non-adiabatically driven quantum interference effects in the ultracold K + KRb $\longrightarrow$ Rb + K$_{2}$ chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The K + KRb $\longrightarrow$ Rb + K$_{2}$ chemical reaction is the first ultracold atom-diatom chemical reaction for which experimental results have been reported for temperatures below 1 $\mu$K more than a decade ago. The reaction occurs through coupling with an excited electronic state that is accessible even in the ultracold limit. A previous quantum dynamics study, excluding non-adiabatic effects, has reported a rate coefficient that is about 35\% below the experimental value. Here, we report the first non-adiabatic quantum dynamics study of this reaction and obtain rate coefficients in better agreement with experiments. Our results show that short-range dynamics mediated by coupling with the excited electronic state introduces quantum interference effects that influence both the state-to-state rate coefficients and the overall reaction rates.</description>

      <title>Gain-assisted control of the photonic spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE), also known as the transverse shift, incident light photons with opposite spins are spatially separated in the transverse direction due to the spin-orbit interaction of light. Here, we propose a gain-assisted model to control the SHE in the reflected probe light. In this model, a probe light is incident on a cavity containing a three-level dilute gaseous atomic medium, where the interaction between the atom and the control field follows two-photon Raman transitions. We show that the direction of photonic spin accumulations can be switched between positive and negative values across the Brewster angle in both the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes. For the same magnitude of control fields, the peak value of the photonic SHE is higher in the anomalous dispersion region compared to the normal dispersion regime. Additionally, the angular range around the Brewster angle is wider in the normal dispersion regime than in the anomalous dispersion region. Furthermore, the peak value of the photonic SHE and the angular range can be controlled by changing the Rabi frequencies of the control fields and the probe field detuning. The measurement of photonic SHE based on gain assistance may enable spin-related applications such as optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum and spin-detection axis. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality.</description>
