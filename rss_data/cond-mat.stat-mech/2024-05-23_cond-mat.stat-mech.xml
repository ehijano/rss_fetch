      <title>Boundary Effects and Confinement in the Theory of Nonabelian Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thesis is devoted to the problem of colour confinement in the non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory (gluon part of Quantum Chromodynamics). A generalisation of the 3-dimensional Fock-Schwinger gauge is proposed where the Gauss law constraint is exactly solvable. This simplifies the theory in a finite domain and incorporates the variables at the boundary into the Hamiltonian formalism. The dependence of the partition function on the boundary value of the longitudinal component of the electric field is studied and related to the mechanism of the confinement-deconfinement transition. The free energy density is calculated for $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gluodynamics in the mean-field approximation for the collective variables. Analysis of its minima reveals a phase transition at a certain temperature, below which the mean collective variables have nonzero values. This can be interpreted as a confinement-deconfinement phase transition. In the confinement phase the chromo-electric flux through any element of the boundary is strictly zero. This means the singletness with respect to the group of the residual gauge transformations and hence impossibility of observing coloured objects at spatial infinity (in asymptotic states). It is demonstrated that our confinement condition satisfies the traditional confinement criteria. The Wilson loop for $SU(N)$ theory is shown to satisfy the area law. The ratio of the transition temperature to the square root of the string tension coefficient is in a qualitative agreement with the result from lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In the deconfinement phase the global symmetry $Z_{N}$ (centre of $SU(N)$) is spontaneously broken by the surface terms. The confinement phase is characterised by unbroken symmetry with all nontrivial minima having the same depth and transformable by $Z_{N}$ actions.</description>

      <title>Emergent behaviour and phase transitions in spatially distributed multi-cellular metabolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overflow metabolism is a ubiquitous phenomenon whereby cells in aerobic conditions excrete byproducts of glycolysis, such as lactate or acetate, into the medium in a seemingly wasteful and polluting fashion. Whilst overflow may confer microbes a fitness advantage by allowing them to overcome a finite oxidative capacity, its occurrence in higher organisms is harder to assess. Important insight was however obtained in recent experiments conducted at single-cell resolution, which revealed that accumulation of overflow products in tumor cell cultures known as the Warburg effect arises from imbalances in the dynamic and heterogeneous inter-cellular exchange network through which cells collectively regulate the microenvironment. Here we provide a quantitative characterization of this scenario by integrating metabolic network modeling with diffusion constraints, statistical physics theory and single-cell experimental flux data. On the theoretical side, we clarify how diffusion-limited exchanges shape the space of viable metabolic states of a multi-cellular system. Specifically, a phase transition from a balanced network of exchanges to an unbalanced overflow regime occurs as the mean cellular glucose and oxygen uptakes vary while single-cell metabolic phenotypes are highly heterogeneous around this transition. We then show that time-resolved data from human tumor-stroma cell co-cultures consistently map to this crossover region, supporting the idea that environmental deterioration reflects a failure of coordination among recurrently interacting cells. In summary, our findings suggest that, rather than deriving from multiple independent cell-autonomous processes, environmental control is an emergent feature of multi-cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Mean First Passage Times and Eyring-Kramers formula for Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally activated phenomena in physics and chemistry, such as conformational changes in biomolecules, liquid film rupture, or ferromagnetic field reversal, are often associated with exponentially long transition times described by Arrhenius' law. The associated subexponential prefactor, given by the Eyring-Kramers formula, has recently been rigorously derived for systems in detailed balance, resulting in a sharp limiting estimate for transition times and reaction rates. Unfortunately, this formula does not trivially apply to systems with conserved quantities, which are ubiquitous in the sciences: The associated zeromodes lead to divergences in the prefactor. We demonstrate how a generalised formula can be derived, and show its applicability to a wide range of systems, including stochastic partial differential equations from fluctuating hydrodynamics, with applications in rupture of nanofilm coatings and social segregation in socioeconomics.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle with saturating rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle whose speed and tumbling rate are space-dependent on an infinite line. Unlike most of the previous work on such models, here we make the physical assumption that at large distances, these rates saturate to a constant. For our choice of rate functions, we show that a stationary state exists, and the exact steady state distribution decays exponentially or faster and can be unimodal or bimodal. The effect of boundedness of rates is seen in the mean-squared displacement of the particle that displays qualitative features different from those observed in the previous studies where it approaches the stationary state value monotonically in time; in contrast, here we find that if the initial position of the particle is sufficiently far from the origin, the variance in its position either varies nonmonotonically or plateaus before reaching the stationary state. These results are captured quantitatively by the exact solution of the Green's function when the particle has uniform speed but the tumbling rates change as a step-function in space; the insights provided by this limiting case are found to be consistent with the numerical results for the general model.</description>

      <title>Synchronization through frequency shuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of engineered and natural systems are modelled as networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators. In nature, the intrinsic frequencies of these oscillators are not constant in time. Here, we probe the effect of such a temporal heterogeneity on coupled oscillator networks, through the lens of the Kuramoto model. To do this, we shuffle repeatedly the intrinsic frequencies among the oscillators at either random or regular time intervals. What emerges is the remarkable effect that frequent shuffling induces earlier onset (i.e., at a lower coupling) of synchrony among the oscillator phases. Our study provides a novel strategy to induce and control synchrony under resource constraints. We demonstrate our results analytically and in experiments with a network of Wien Bridge oscillators with internal frequencies being shuffled in time.</description>

      <title>Lattice model for percolation on a plane of partially aligned sticks with length dispersity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lattice-based model for continuum percolation is applied to the case of randomly located, partially aligned sticks with unequal lengths in 2D which are allowed to cross each other. Results are obtained for the critical number of sticks per unit area at the percolation threshold in terms of the distributions over length and orientational angle and are compared with findings from computer simulations. Consistent with findings from computer simulations, our model shows that the percolation threshold is (i) elevated by increasing degrees of alignment for a fixed length distribution, and (ii) lowered by increasing degrees of length dispersity for a fixed orientational distribution. The impact of length dispersity is predicted to be governed entirely by the first and second moments of the stick length distribution, and the threshold is shown to be quite sensitive to particulars of the orientational distribution function.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of convolutional recurrent neural networks near their critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the dynamical properties of a single-layer convolutional recurrent network with a smooth sigmoidal activation function, for small values of the inputs and when the convolution kernel is unitary, so all eigenvalues lie exactly at the unit circle. Such networks have a variety of hallmark properties: the outputs depend on the inputs via compressive nonlinearities such as cubic roots, and both the timescales of relaxation and the length-scales of signal propagation depend sensitively on the inputs as power laws, both diverging as the input to 0. The basic dynamical mechanism is that inputs to the network generate ongoing activity, which in turn controls how additional inputs or signals propagate spatially or attenuate in time. We present analytical solutions for the steady states when the network is forced with a single oscillation and when a background value creates a steady state of ongoing activity, and derive the relationships shaping the value of the temporal decay and spatial propagation length as a function of this background value.</description>

      <title>Consistent expansion of the Langevin propagator with application to entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics is a developing theory for systems out of thermal equilibrium. It allows to formulate a wealth of nontrivial relations among thermodynamic quantities such as heat dissipation, excess work, and entropy production in generic nonequilibrium stochastic processes. A key quantity for the derivation of these relations is the propagator - the probability to observe a transition from one point in phase space to another after a given time. Here, applying stochastic Taylor expansions, we devise a formal expansion procedure for the propagator of overdamped Langevin dynamics. The three leading orders are obtained explicitly. The technique resolves the shortcomings of the current mathematical machinery for the calculation of the propagator. For the evaluation of the first two displacement cumulants, the leading order Gaussian propagator is sufficient. However, some functionals of the propagator - such as the entropy production - which we refer to as "first derivatives of the trajectory", need to be evaluated to a previously-unrecognized higher order. The method presented here can be extended to arbitrarily higher orders in order to accurately compute any other functional of the propagator.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics in chaotic quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an ensemble of two-dimensional nonintegrable quantum circuits that are chaotic but have a conserved particle current, and thus a finite Drude weight. The long-wavelength hydrodynamics of such systems is given by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. By analyzing circuit-to-circuit fluctuations in the ensemble we argue that these are negligible, so the circuit-averaged value of transport coefficients like the viscosity is also (in the long-time limit) the value in a typical circuit. The circuit-averaged transport coefficients can be mapped onto a classical irreversible Markov process. Therefore, remarkably, our construction allows us to efficiently compute the viscosity of a family of strongly interacting chaotic two-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Collective oscillations in a three-dimensional spin model with non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the onset of collective oscillations at low temperature in a three-dimensional spin model with non-reciprocal short-range interactions. Performing numerical simulations of the model, the presence of a continuous phase transition to global oscillations is confirmed by a finite-size scaling analysis. By systematically varying the interaction range, we show that collective oscillations in this spin model actually result from two successive phase transitions: a mean-field phase transition over finite-size neighborhoods, which leads to the emergence of local noisy oscillators, and a synchronization transition of local noisy oscillators, which generates coherent macroscopic oscillations. Using a Fokker-Planck equation under a local mean-field approximation, we derive from the spin dynamics coupled Langevin equations for the complex amplitudes describing noisy oscillations on a mesoscopic scale. The phase diagram of these coupled equations is qualitatively obtained from a fully-connected (mean-field) approximation. This analytical approach allows us to clearly disentangle the onset of local and global oscillations, and to identify the two main control parameters, expressed as combinations of the microscopic parameters of the spin dynamics, that control the phase diagram of the model.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect for a $Q$-clock type system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetocaloric effect applied to a magnetic working substance corresponding to a square lattice of spins with $Q$ possible orientations known as the ``$Q$-state clock model" where for $Q\geq 5$, the systems present the famous Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase (BKT). Thermodynamic quantities are obtained in exact form for a small lattice size of $L \times L$ with $L=3$ and by the mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations for $Q$ pairs between 2 and 8 with $L = 3, 8, 16, 32$ with free boundary conditions, and magnetic fields varying between $B = 0$ and $1$ in natural units of the system. By obtaining the entropy, it is possible to quantify the caloric effect through an isothermal process in which the external magnetic field on the spin system is varied. In particular, we find the values of $Q$ that maximize the effect depending on the lattice size and the magnetic phase transitions related to maximizing the caloric phenomena. These indicate that in a small lattice (up to $\sim 7\times 7$), when $Q\geq 5$, the transition that maximizes the effect is related to ferromagnetic to BKT type. In contrast, transitioning from BKT to paramagnetic type increases the system's caloric response when we work with a larger lattice size.</description>

      <title>Active Magnetic Matter: Propelling Ferrimagnetic Domain Walls by Dynamical Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter encompasses many-particle systems with self-propelling units, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we show how self-propelling domain walls can be realised in a solid-state system when a ferrimagnet is weakly driven out of thermal equilibrium by an oscillating field. This activates the Goldstone mode, inducing a rotation of the antiferromagnetic xy-order in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. Two opposite directions of rotation meet at a ferromagnetic domain wall, resulting in 'dynamical frustration', with three main consequences. (i) Domain walls move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their speed is proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. (ii) In one dimension (1D), after a quench into the ferrimagnetic phase, this motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. (iii) The dynamical frustration makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven 1D system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>

      <title>Optimal diffusion of chiral active particles with strategic reorientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the competing effects of simultaneous presence of chirality and generalised tumbles in the dynamics of an active Brownian particle. Chiral active particles perform circular motions that give rise to slow transport at late times. By interrupting these circular trajectories at the right time or by performing a tumble at the correct angle, we show that particles can enhance their diffusion. After deriving exact expressions for the orientational propagator and correlations, we use this to calculate the first two moments of displacement. For the effective diffusion coefficient, we study various optimal tumbling strategies. We show that under optimisation of the tumbling rate, the case of symmetrically distributed tumbles always give rise to enhanced diffusion, with an effective diffusion coefficient taking a universal value. Next, two cases are considered in detail, namely directional reversal and tumbles at an arbitrary but fixed angle. We discuss how asymmetric tumbles can enhance diffusion beyond that of symmetric tumbles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric integration with hyperlogarithms so far has been successfully used in problems of high energy physics (HEP) and critical statics. In this work, for the first time, it is applied to a problem of critical dynamics, namely, a stochastic model of developed turbulence in high-dimensional spaces, which has a propagator that is non-standard with respect to the HEP: $(-i \omega + \nu k^2)^{-1}$. Adaptation of the hyperlogarithm method is carried out by choosing a proper renormalization scheme and considering an effective dimension of the space. Analytical calculation of the renormalization group functions is performed up to the fourth order of the perturbation theory, $\varepsilon$-expansion of the critical exponent $\omega$ responsible for the infrared stability of the fixed point is obtained.</description>

      <title>Critical Short-Time Behavior of Majority-Vote Model on Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the short-time behavior of the majority vote dynamics on scale-free networks at the critical threshold. We introduce a heterogeneous mean-field theory on the critical short-time behavior of the majority-vote model on scale-free networks. In addition, we also compare the heterogeneous mean-field predictions with extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the short-time dependencies of the order parameter and the susceptibility. We obtained a closed expression for the dynamical exponent $z$ and the time correlation exponent $\nu_\parallel$. Short-time scaling is compatible with a non-universal critical behavior for $5/2 &lt; \gamma &lt; 7/2$, and for $\gamma \geq 7/2$, we have the mean-field Ising criticality with additional logarithmic corrections for $\gamma=7/2$, in the same way as the stationary scaling.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how all relevant objects involved in the calculation of the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point can be predicted by using conformal field theories. We check such prediction with tensor networks finding excellent agreement. In particular we are able to predict and confirm that in such an out-of-equilibrium scenario, we observe an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution. We also show how to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT from such out-of-equilibrium protocol, including, the central charge, the operator content, and the generalized temporal entropies. In particular we show that using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Water: A Molecular Dynamics Study on the Effects of Molecule Count and Cutoff Radius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the study of systems confined within various materials, such as graphene and graphene oxide, for diverse applications such as water desalination, metal separation from water, battery cells, and high-efficiency capacitors, is very common. Among these systems, water is a prominent subject of investigation. Understanding the impact of the number of molecules and the optimal cutoff radius is essential in order to determine the parameters. This study investigates the dielectric properties of H2O in relation to both the number of molecules and the cutoff radius within the simulation cell. We employ the flexible water model FBA/$\epsilon$, known for its improved accuracy in reproducing water properties across various thermodynamic states. We range from 60 to 1372 molecules and use cutoff radius from 6 nm to 1.2 nm, encompassing a wide range of calculations to assess their impact on the simulation results, including critical properties like the dielectric constant, density, and phase change enthalpy.</description>

      <title>How glassy are neural networks?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image charge effect is a fundamental problem in electrostatics. However, a proper treatment at the continuum level for many-ion systems, such as electrolyte solutions or ionic liquids, remains an open theoretical question. Here, we demonstrate and systematically compare the image charge effects under metal and dielectric boundary conditions (BCs), based on a renormalized Gaussian-fluctuation theory. Our calculations for a simple 1:1 symmetric electrolyte in the point-charge approximation show that the double-layer structure, capacitance, and interaction forces between like-charged plates depend strongly on the types of boundaries, even in the weak-coupling regime. Like-charge attraction is predicted for both metal and dielectric BCs. Finally, we comment on the effects of a dielectrically-saturated solvent layer on the metal surface. We provide these results to serve as a baseline for comparison with more realistic molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Uncovering gauge-dependent critical order-parameter correlations by a stochastic gauge fixing at O($N$)$^*$ and Ising$^*$ continuous transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the O($N$)$^*$ transitions that occur in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge $N$-vector model, and the analogous Ising$^*$ transitions occurring in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge Higgs model, corresponding to an $N$-vector model with $N=1$. At these transitions, gauge-invariant correlations behave as in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. Instead, the nongauge invariant spin correlations are trivial and therefore the spin order parameter that characterizes the spontaneous breaking of the O($N$) symmetry in standard $N$-vector/Ising systems is apparently absent. We define a novel gauge fixing procedure -- we name it stochastic gauge fixing -- that allows us to define a gauge-dependent vector field that orders at the transition and is therefore the appropriate order parameter for the O($N$) symmetry breaking. To substantiate this approach, we perform numerical simulations for $N=3$ and $N=1$. A finite-size scaling analysis of the numerical data allows us to confirm the general scenario: the gauge-fixed spin correlation functions behave as the corresponding functions computed in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. The emergence of a critical vector order parameter in the gauge model shows the complete equivalence of the O($N$)$^*$/Ising$^*$ and O($N$)/Ising universality classes.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in Safety-Critical Hamiltonian Systems with Probabilistic Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of determining the least improbable deviations leading to an unsafe rare event in a weakly perturbed mechanical system with probabilistic initial conditions. These deviations are obtained as the solution to a variational problem formulated using rigorous approximation techniques grounded in the principles of large deviations theory. These types of results have been extended to accommodate stochastic uncertainty in the initial states, which is a common assumption in mechanical systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of the method by solving the problem for a rare collision event between two space objects, i.e. a high-dimensional and non-linear problem, resulting in the most likely sample paths leading to the realization of the unsafe rare event. The solution is validated against the necessary conditions for optimality derived from the maximum principle. Access to these unsafe sample paths offers relevant information regarding the dangerous configurations of rare events and can be used to design control strategies to reduce the probability of realization.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, in a narrow region, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Extension of the SpK Atomic Physics Code to Generate Global Equation of State Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global microphysics models are required for the modelling of high-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments, the improvement of which are critical to the path to inertial fusion energy. This work presents further developments to the atomic and microphysics code, SpK, part of the numerical modelling suite of Imperial College London and First Light Fusion. We extend the capabilities of SpK to allow the calculation of the equation of state (EoS). The detailed configuration accounting calculations are interpolated into finite-temperature Thomas-Fermi calculations at high coupling to form the electronic component of the model. The Cowan model provides the ionic contribution, modified to approximate the physics of diatomic molecular dissociation. By utilising bonding corrections and performing a Maxwell construction, SpK captures the EoS from states ranging from the zero-pressure solid, through the liquid-vapour coexistence region and into plasma states. This global approach offers the benefit of capturing electronic shell structure over large regions of parameter space, building highly-resolved tables in minutes on a simple desktop. We present shock Hugoniot and off-Hugoniot calculations for a number of materials, comparing SpK to other models and experimental data. We also apply EoS and opacity data generated by SpK in integrated simulations of indirectly-driven capsule implosions, highlighting physical sensitivities to the choice of EoS models.</description>

Abstract: The chromium spinels MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 are prime examples of the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet. Experiment has carefully established that both materials, upon cooling, distort to lower symmetry and order magnetically. We study the nature of this process by a combination of density-functional-theory based energy mapping and classical Monte Carlo simulations. We first computationally establish precise Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters for the high temperature cubic and the low temperature tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of both spinels. We then investigate the respective ordering temperatures of high symmetry and low symmetry structures. We carefully compare our results with experimental facts and find that our simulations are remarkably consistent with a type of spin-Peierls mechanism, adapted to three dimensions, where the structural distortion is mediated by a magnetic energy gain due to a lower degree of frustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical affinities are responsible for driving active matter systems out of equilibrium. At the nano-scale, molecular machines interact with the surrounding environment and are subjected to external forces. The mechano-chemical coupling which arises naturally in these systems reveals a complex interplay between chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom with strong impact on their active mechanism. By considering various models far from equilibrium, we show that the tuning of applied forces give rise to a nonlinear response that causes a non-monotonic behaviour in the machines' activity. Our findings have implications in understanding, designing, and triggering such processes by controlled application of external fields, including the collective dynamics of larger non-equilibrium systems where the total dissipation and performance might be affected by internal and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact finite-size scaling spectra in the quenched and annealed Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine resolution of the discrete eigenvalues at the spectral edge of an $N\times N$ random matrix is required in many applications. Starting from a finite-size scaling ansatz for the Stieltjes transform of the maximum likelihood spectrum, we show that the scaling function satisfies a first-order ODE of the Riccati type. Further transformation yields a linear second-order ODE for the characteristic function, whose nodes yield the exact locations of leading eigenvalues. With this new technique, we examine in detail the spectral crossover of the annealed Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model where a gap develops below a certain critical temperature. Our analysis yields analytic predictions for the finite-size scaling of the spin condensation phenomenon in both quenched and annealed SK models, which are then compared and validated in Monte Carlo simulations of the annealed model. More generally, rescaling of the spectral axis, adjusted to the distance of neighboring eigenvalues, offers a powerful strategy to deal with singularities that arise in the infinite size limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a kind of power-law-exponential (PLE) dipole-dipole interaction between quantum emitters in a 1D waveguide QED system. This unconventional long-range interaction is the combination of power-law growth and exponential decay couplings. Applying PLE interaction to a spin model, we uncover the rich many-body phases. Most remarkably, we find that PLE interaction can induce the ordered and critical spiral phases. These spiral phases emerge from the strong frustration generated by the power-law factor of PLE interaction, hence they are absent for other types of long-range interaction, e.g., pure exponential and power-law decay interactions. Our work is also applicable for the higher dimensional systems. It fundamentally broadens the realm of many-body physics and has the significant applications in quantum simulation of strong correlated matters.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides what is hopefully a self-contained set of notes describing the detailed steps of a generating-functional analysis of systems of generalised Lotka-Volterra equations with random interaction coefficients. Nothing in these notes is original, instead the generating-functional method (also known as the Martin-Siggia-Rose-DeDominic-Janssen formalism) and the resulting dynamic mean field theories have been used for the study of disordered systems and spin glasses for decades. But it is hard to find unifying sources which would allow a beginner to learn step-by-step how these methods can be used. My aim is to provide such a source. Most of the calculations are specific to generalised Lotka-Volterra systems, but much can be transferred to disordered systems in more general.</description>

Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of universal quantum chaotic signatures in the transverse field Ising model on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network. This is achieved by studying local spectral measures such as the level spacing and the level velocity statistics. A spectral form factor analysis is also performed as a global measure, probing energy level correlations at arbitrary spectral distances. Our findings show that these measures capture the breakdown of chaotic behavior upon varying the connectivity and strength of the transverse field in various regimes. We demonstrate that the level spacing statistics and the spectral form factor signal this breakdown for sparsely and densely connected networks. The velocity statistics capture the surviving chaotic signatures in the sparse limit. However, these integrable-like regimes extend over a vanishingly small segment in the full range of connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The essence of the Mpemba effect is that non-equilibrium systems may relax faster the further they are from their equilibrium configuration. In the quantum realm, this phenomenon arises in the dynamics of closed systems, where it is witnessed by fundamental features such as symmetry and entanglement. Here, we study the quantum Mpemba effect in charge-preserving random circuits on qudits via entanglement asymmetry, combining extensive numerical simulations and analytical mapping to a classical statistical mechanics problem. We show that the more asymmetric certain classes of initial states (tilted ferromagnets) are, the faster they restore symmetry and reach the grand-canonical ensemble. Conversely, other classes of states (tilted antiferromagnets) do not show the Mpemba effect. Our analysis is based on minimal principles -- locality, unitarity, and symmetry. Consequently, our results represent a significant advancement in clarifying the emergence of Mpemba physics in generic systems, including Hamiltonian and Floquet quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separations in strongly coupled fine particles in plasmas are discussed and two-component mixtures are simulated by molecular dynamics with the background plasma being treated as continuum. The system size of laboratory experiments is assumed and separations into phases with a common electron density of the background plasma are analyzed. Since the charge on fine particles increases approximately in proportion to the size, we expect the larger component with stronger coupling condensates from the mixture. Results expressed in terms of strengths of Coulomb coupling and screening of the larger component seem to be mostly similar to the one-component case, at least in cases where the ratio of fine particle sizes is 2 and the mixing ratio is in the range from 0.25 to 0.75.</description>

      <title>Cascade of phase transitions in the training of Energy-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian way for the relaxation time approximation, application to Kibble-Zurek processes due to environment temperature quench, and to Lindbladian perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, a global Lindbladian ansatz is constructed which leads to thermalization at temperature $T$ to the Gibs state of the investigated system. This ansatz connects every two eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and leads to a simple master equation known in the literature as the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The main message of this paper is that RTA, being a Lindbladian approach itself, can be used as Lindbladian securing thermalization when modeling physical processes, and can be consequently combined with other types of Lindbladians which would drive the system of the equilibrium state. I demonstrate it with two applications. The first application is the slow cooling (or heating) of quantum systems by varying the environment temperature to a critical point. With this RTA-Lindblad ansatz, one can directly relate to the equilibrium behavior of the system, and if an order parameter has the exponent $\Psi$, the remaining value at the phase transition will decrease with $1/\tau^{\Psi}$, where $\tau$ is the overall time of the slow process. In the second application, I investigate the change in the expectation value of a conserved quantity (an operator commuting with the Hamiltonian) due to an extra Lindbladian term which would drive the system out from equilibrium, while the thermalizing RTA-Lindbladian term is also present. I give a closed perturbative expression in the first order for the expectation value in the new steady state using only expectation values calculated in the original thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A differentiable programming framework for spin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating spin models using differentiable programming, an approach that leverages the advancements in machine learning and computational efficiency. We focus on three distinct spin systems: the Ising model, the Potts model, and the Cellular Potts model, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of our framework in modeling these complex systems. Additionally, this framework allows for the optimization of spin models, which can adjust the parameters of a system by a defined objective function. In order to simulate these models, we adapt the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to a differentiable programming paradigm, employing batched tensors for simulating spin lattices. This adaptation not only facilitates the integration with existing deep learning tools but also significantly enhances computational speed through parallel processing capabilities, as it can be implemented on different hardware architectures, including GPUs and TPUs.</description>

      <title>Operator scars in open systems and their relation to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen scars in closed bilayer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. We identify broad classes of many-body models that support explicitly known eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperators (Lindbladians) $\mathcal L$. The expectation value of the observables defined by these operators exhibits a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Generically, the Lindbladians under study are nonintegrable; in such cases operators $Q$ are similar to special eigenstates in closed many-body systems known as quantum many-body scars. We make this analogy precise by employing the duality between open systems and closed systems with doubled degrees of freedom. Under this duality, operator scars in open systems map to recently discovered Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) scars in closed bilayer systems. Furthermore, we show that there is a family of such dualities which allows one to obtain EPR-like scars with a prescribed entanglement between layers. This opens a novel perspective on EPR scars in closed bilayer systems that clarifies known facts and facilitates new developments.</description>

      <title>Integrability as an attractor of adiabatic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum chaos and integrability has been extensively studied in the past decades. We approach this topic from the point of view of geometry encoded in the quantum geometric tensor, which describes the complexity of adiabatic transformations. In particular, we consider two generic models of spin chains that are parameterized by two independent couplings. In one, the integrability breaking perturbation is global while, in the other, integrability is broken only at the boundary. In both cases, the shortest paths in the coupling space lead towards integrable regions and we argue that this behavior is generic. These regions thus act as attractors of adiabatic flows similar to river basins in nature. Physically, the directions towards integrable regions are characterized by faster relaxation dynamics than those parallel to integrability, and the anisotropy between them diverges in the thermodynamic limit as the system approaches the integrable point. We also provide evidence that the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior is universal for both models, similar to continuous phase transitions, and that the model with local integrability breaking quickly becomes chaotic but avoids ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum dynamics of observables at eigenstate transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the initially localized charge density-wave states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a) A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes the corresponding recent result for survival probabilities [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 043301 (2023)]. These properties suggest that the scale-invariant critical dynamics in the quantum-quench dynamics is also exhibited by the observables, which share the common eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance, we numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e model model.</description>

      <title>Work fluctuation theorems with initial quantum coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16227v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems, by considering a quasiprobability distribution of work. To do this, we formulate and examine the implications of a detailed fluctuation theorem, which reproduces the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>A Novel ES-BGK Model for Non-Polytropic Gases with Internal State Density Independent of the Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel ES-BGK-based model of non-polytropic rarefied gases in the framework of kinetic theory is presented. Key features of this model are: an internal state density function depending only on the microscopic energy of internal modes (avoiding the dependence on temperature seen in previous reference studies); full compliance with the H-theorem; feasibility of the closure of the system of moment equations based on the maximum entropy principle, following the well-established procedure of Rational Extended Thermodynamics.
  The structure of planar shock waves in carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) obtained with the present model is in general good agreement with that of previous results, except for the computed internal temperature profile, which is qualitatively different with respect to the results obtained in previous studies, showing here a consistently monotonous behavior across the shock structure, rather than the non monotonous behavior previously found.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical results for the Rosenzweig Porter model for all symmetry classes of the Dyson threefold way. We analyzed the fluctuation properties in the eigenvalue spectra, and compared them with existing and new analytical results. Based on these results we propose characteristics of the spectral properties as measures to explore the transition from Poisson to Wigner Dyson WD statistics. Furthermore, we performed thorough studies of the properties of the eigenvectors in terms of the fractal dimensions, the Kullback Leibler KL divergences and the fidelity susceptibility. The ergodic and Anderson transitions take place at the same parameter values and a finite size scaling analysis of the KL divergences at the transitions yields the same critical exponents for all three WD classes, thus indicating superuniversality of these transitions.</description>

      <title>Power-law relaxation of a confined diffusing particle subject to resetting with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at large time toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulations of the Blinking-Checkers Model for Polyamorphic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blinking-checkers model [F. Caupin and M. A. Anisimov, Phys. Rev. Lett, 127,185701 (2021)] is a minimal lattice model which has demonstrated that, in the meanfield approximation, it can reproduce the phenomenon of fluid polyamorphism. This model is a binary lattice-gas, in which each site has three possible states: empty, occupied with particles of type 1, and occupied with particles of type 2. Additionally, the two types of particles may interconvert from one to another. Equilibrium interconversion imposes a constraint that makes this model thermodynamically equivalent to a single-component system. In this work, Monte-Carlo simulations of the blinking-checkers model are performed, demonstrating polyamorphic phase behavior. The locations of the liquid-liquid and liquid-gas critical points are found to be different from the meanfield predictions for this model with the same interaction parameters, as the phase behavior is significantly affected by critical fluctuations. Based on the computed values of the critical exponents of the order parameter, susceptibility, correlation length, and surface tension, we confirm that the blinking-checkers model, for both liquid-gas and liquid-liquid equilibria, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising class of critical-point universality.</description>

      <title>Complete Realization of Energy Landscape and Non-equilibrium Trapping Dynamics in Spin Glass and Optimization Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy landscapes are high-dimensional surfaces representing the dependence of system energy on variable configurations, which determine crucially the system's emergent behavior but are difficult to be analyzed due to their high-dimensional nature. In this article, we introduce an approach to reveal the complete energy landscapes of small spin glasses and Boolean satisfiability problems, which also unravels their non-equilibrium dynamics at an arbitrary temperature for an arbitrarily long time. In contrary to our common belief, our results show that it can be less likely to identify the ground states when temperature decreases, due to trapping in individual local minima, which ceases at different time, leading to multiple abrupt jumps with time in the ground-state probability. Simulations agree well with theoretical predictions on these remarkable phenomena. Finally, for large systems, we introduce a variant approach to extract partially the energy landscapes and observe both analytically and in simulations similar phenomena. This work introduces new methodology to unravel the non-equilibrium dynamics of glassy systems, and provides us with a clear, complete and new physical picture on their long-time behaviors inaccessible by modern numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The innate complexity of solid state physics exposes superconducting quantum circuits to interactions with uncontrolled degrees of freedom degrading their coherence. By using a simple stabilization sequence we show that a superconducting fluxonium qubit is coupled to a two-level system (TLS) environment of unknown origin, with a relatively long energy relaxation time exceeding $50\,\text{ms}$. Implementing a quantum Szilard engine with an active feedback control loop allows us to decide whether the qubit heats or cools its TLS environment. The TLSs can be cooled down resulting in a four times lower qubit population, or they can be heated to manifest themselves as a negative temperature environment corresponding to a qubit population of $\sim 80\,\%$. We show that the TLSs and the qubit are each other's dominant loss mechanism and that the qubit relaxation is independent of the TLS populations. Understanding and mitigating TLS environments is therefore not only crucial to improve qubit lifetimes but also to avoid non-Markovian qubit dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a consistent thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental progress in atomic, molecular, and optical platforms in the last decade has stimulated strong and broad interest in the quantum coherent dynamics of many long-range interacting particles. The prominent collective character of these systems enables novel non-equilibrium phenomena with no counterpart in conventional quantum systems with local interactions. Much of the theory work in this area either focussed on the impact of variable-range interaction tails on the physics of local interactions or relied on mean-field-like descriptions based on the opposite limit of all-to-all infinite-range interactions. In this Report, we present a systematic and organic review of recent advances in the field. Working with prototypical interacting quantum spin lattices without disorder, our presentation hinges upon a versatile theoretical formalism that interpolates between the few-body mean-field physics and the many-body physics of quasi-local interactions. Such a formalism allows us to connect these two regimes, providing both a formal quantitative tool and basic physical intuition. We leverage this unifying framework to review several findings of the last decade, including the peculiar non-ballistic spreading of quantum correlations, counter-intuitive slowdown of entanglement dynamics, suppression of thermalization and equilibration, anomalous scaling of defects upon traversing criticality, dynamical phase transitions, and genuinely non-equilibrium phases stabilized by periodic driving. The style of this Report is on the pedagogical side, which makes it accessible to readers without previous experience in the subject matter.</description>

Abstract: Our work is dedicated to the introduction and investigation of a new asymptotic correlation relation in the field of mean field models and limits. This new notion, order (as opposed to chaos), revolves around a tendency for self organisation in a given system and is expected to be observed in biological and societal models. Beyond the definition of this new notion, our work will show its applicability, and propagation, in the so-called Choose the Leader model.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigations of the extensive entanglement Hamiltonian in quantum spin ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01699</link>

Abstract: Entanglement constitutes one of the key concepts in quantum mechanics and serves as an indispensable tool in the understanding of quantum many-body systems. In this work, we perform extensive numerical investigations of extensive entanglement properties of coupled quantum spin chains. This setup has proven useful for e.g. extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to open systems, and contrasts the majority of previous research where the entanglement cut has one lower dimension than the system. We focus on the cases where the entanglement Hamiltonian is either gapless or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking behavior. We further employ conformal field theoretical formulae to identify the universal behavior in the former case. The results in our work can serve as a paradigmatic starting point for more systematic exploration of the largely uncharted physics of extensive entanglement, both analytical and numerical.</description>

      <title>Robust effective ground state in a nonintegrable Floquet quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An external periodic (Floquet) drive is believed to bring any initial state to the featureless infinite temperature state in generic nonintegrable isolated quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit, irrespective of the driving frequency $\Omega$. However, numerical or analytical evidence either proving or disproving this hypothesis is very limited and the issue has remained unsettled. Here, we study the initial state dependence of Floquet heating in a nonintegrable kicked Ising chain of length up to $L=30$ with an efficient quantum circuit simulator, showing a possible counterexample: The ground state of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian is exceptionally robust against heating, and could stay at finite energy density even after infinitely many Floquet cycles, if the driving period is shorter than a threshold value. This sharp energy localization transition/crossover does not happen for generic excited states. The exceptional robustness of the ground state is interpreted by (i) its isolation in the energy spectrum and (ii) the fact that those states with $L$-independent $\hbar\Omega$ energy above the ground state energy of any generic local Hamiltonian, like the approximate Floquet Hamiltonian, are atypical and viewed as a collection of noninteracting quasipartiles. Our finding paves the way for engineering Floquet protocols with finite driving periods realizing long-lived, or possibly even perpetual, Floquet phases by initial state design.</description>

      <title>Data-driven analysis of annual rain distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rainfall is an important component of the climate system and its statistical properties are vital for prediction purposes. In this study, we have developed a statistical method for constructing the distribution of annual precipitation. The method is based on the convolution of the measured monthly rainfall distributions and does not depend on any presumed annual rainfall distribution. Using a simple statistical model, we demonstrate that our approach allows for a better prediction of extremely dry or wet years with a recurrence time several times longer than the original time series. The method that has been proposed can be utilized for other climate variables as well.</description>

      <title>Efficient Paths for Local Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local counterdiabatic driving (CD) provides a feasible approach for realizing approximate reversible/adiabatic processes like quantum state preparation using only local controls and without demanding excessively long protocol times. However, in many instances getting high accuracy of such CD protocols requires engineering very complicated new controls or pulse sequences. In this work, we describe a systematic method for altering the adiabatic path by adding extra local controls along which performance of local CD protocols is enhanced, both close to and far away from the adiabatic limit. We also identify an iterative procedure to improve the performance of local counterdiabatic driving further without any knowledge of the quantum wavefunction. We then show that these methods provides dramatic improvement in the preparation of non-trivial GHZ ground states of several different spin systems with both short-range and long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness via matrix product states in the Pauli basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', stands as a crucial resource for achieving a potential advantage in quantum computing. Its connection to many-body physical phenomena is poorly understood at present, mostly due to a lack of practical methods to compute it at large scales. We present a novel approach for the evaluation of nonstabilizerness within the framework of matrix product states (MPS), based on expressing the MPS directly in the Pauli basis. Our framework provides a powerful tool for efficiently calculating various measures of nonstabilizerness, including stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, stabilizer nullity, and Bell magic, and enables the learning of the stabilizer group of an MPS. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our method in the ground states of Ising and XXZ spin chains, as well as in circuits dynamics that has recently been realized in Rydberg atom arrays, where we provide concrete benchmarks for future experiments on logical qubits up to twice the sizes already realized.</description>

      <title>Broken detailed balance and entropy production in directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the the degree to which a network is directed and hierarchically organised is closely associated with the degree to which its dynamics break detailed balance and produce entropy. We consider a range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features affect their entropy production rate. We begin with an analytical treatment of a 2-node network followed by numerical simulations of synthetic networks using the preferential attachment and Erd\"os-Renyi algorithms. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks to determine the effect of complex real-world topologies. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium dynamics and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the consequences of directed network structure on non-equilibrium dynamics and highlight the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling measurement induced phase transitions with tunable detector coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ Abelian lattice gauge theories using a bootstrap method, in which the loop equations and positivity conditions are employed for Wilson loops with lengths $L\leqslant L_{\textrm{max}}$ to derive two-sided bounds on the Wilson loop averages. We address a fundamental question that whether the constraints from loop equations and positivity are strong enough to solve lattice gauge theories. We answer this question by bootstrapping the 2D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory. We show that with sufficiently large $L_{\textrm{max}}=60$, the two-sided bounds provide estimates for the plaquette averages with precision near $10^{-8}$ or even higher, suggesting the bootstrap constraints are sufficient to numerically pin down this theory. We compute the bootstrap bounds on the plaquette averages in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories with $L_{\textrm{max}}=16$. In the regions with weak or strong coupling, the two-sided bootstrap bounds converge quickly and coincide with the perturbative results to high precision. The bootstrap bounds are well consistent with the Monte Carlo results in the nonperturbative region. We observe interesting connections between the bounds generated by the bootstrap computations and the Griffiths' inequalities. We present results towards bootstrapping the string tension and glueball mass in Abelian lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamic hyperuniform states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform structures are an exotic state of matter having suppressed density fluctuations at large length-scale similar to perfect crystals and quasicrystals but without any long range orientational order. In the past decade, an increasing number of non-equilibrium systems were found to have dynamic hyperuniform states, which have emerged as a new research direction coupling both non-equilibrium physics and hyperuniformity. Here we review the recent progress in understanding dynamic hyperuniform states found in various non-equilibrium systems, including the critical hyperuniformity in absorbing phase transitions, non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids and the hyperuniform structures in phase separating systems via spinodal decomposition.</description>
