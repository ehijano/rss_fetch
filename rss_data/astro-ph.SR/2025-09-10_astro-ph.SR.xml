      <title>Simulations of Flare Chemistry in Brown Dwarf Companions to Active M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs that are short period ($&lt;10\,$day) companions to actively flaring M dwarfs may provide a context to directly observe flare-driven photochemistry and structural changes in an extrasolar planet-like atmosphere. To assess the viability of directly observing flare impacts in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf, we perform self-consistent temperature-chemistry modeling of the atmospheric response to individual energetic superflares. We modified the existing open-source \texttt{VULCAN} chemical-kinetics and \texttt{HELIOS} radiative-transfer codes for this purpose. Similar to previous studies of flare impacts on hydrogen dominated atmospheres, we find flares are capable of orders-of-magnitude changes in the mixing abundances of many chemical species, including important opacity sources like CH$_4$ and CO$_2$. However, due to fast chemical timescales resulting from high temperatures and densities in brown dwarf atmospheres, these changes last for a short-period of time, generally less than a day, and are only plausibly observable via high resolution emission spectroscopy. We find that the most observable, short-term spectral changes in hot (T$_{\text{eff}}\sim2000\,$K), high-gravity ($\log{\text{g}}\sim5$), cloudless brown dwarfs are the photolysis of H$_2$O and enhancement of CO$_2$, which can result in part-per-thousands spectral changes in the hours after a flare.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Sun's Alfv\'en surface and wind braking torque with Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alfv\'en surface -- where the solar wind exceeds the local Alfv\'en speed as it expands into interplanetary space -- is now routinely probed by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the near-Sun environment. The size of the Alfv\'en surface governs how efficiently the solar wind braking torque causes the Sun to spin-down. We aimed to characterise the size and evolution of the Alfv\'en surface as magnetic activity increased during solar cycle 25. The Alfv\'en surface was extrapolated from the solar wind mass and magnetic flux measured by the SWEAP and FIELDS instrument suites onboard PSP. We accounted for the acceleration of the solar wind along Parker spiral magnetic field lines and used potential field source surface modelling to determine the sources of the solar wind. The longitudinally averaged Alfv\'en radius measured by PSP grew from 11 to 16 solar radii as solar activity increased. Accordingly, the solar wind angular momentum-loss rate grew from $\sim$1.4$\times 10^{30}$ erg to 3$\times 10^{30}$ erg. Both the radial and longitudinal scans of the solar wind contained fluctuations of 10-40\% from the average Alfv\'en radius in each encounter. Structure in the solar corona influenced the morphology of the Alfv\'en surface, which was smallest around the heliospheric current sheet and pseudostreamers. The Alfv\'en surface was highly structured and time-varying however, at large-scales, organised by the coronal magnetic field. The evolution of the solar corona over the solar cycle systematically shifted the magnetic connectivity of PSP and influenced our perception of the Alfv\'en surface. The Alfv\'en surface was 30\% larger than both thermally-driven and Alfv\'en wave-driven wind simulations with the same mass-loss rate and open magnetic flux, but had a similar dependence on the wind magnetisation parameter.</description>

      <title>HE2159-0551: a very metal-poor peculiar low Ba giant -- a candidate from the LMS-1/Wukong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of the very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.60 $\pm$ 0.20 dex) giant star HE2159-0551. By investigating the star's chemodynamic characteristics, we seek to address its formation, evolution, and role in the chemical enrichment of the early cosmos and the possible connection to known merger events. From high-resolution data we perform a one dimension, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis using PyMoogi. We conduct a detailed abundance analysis of 23 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and Eu), allowing us to derive abundances or place limits. Finally, we compute orbital parameters to investigate the kinematics and thus the nucleosynthetic origin of HE2159-0551. The analysis yields significant insights into the chemical composition of HE2159-0551, highlighting its peculiarities among very metal-poor stars. The star shows signs of internal mixing and a peculiar abundance pattern, particular regarding the heavy elements. We find a low Ba abundance (s-process element) and a suppressed contamination of r-process elements, even though r-process enrichment may be expected in very metal-poor stars. The orbital parameters and kinematic properties indicate that HE2159-0551 is a thick disc star, connected to the old and metal-poor LMS-1/Wukong progenitor resulting from an early merger. Our kinematic analysis suggests a potential connection of HE2159-0551 to the merger LMS-1/Wukong. We conclude that the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the star's enrichment in heavy elements are different from those observed in many other metal-poor stars as neither the main r- nor s-process can explain the derived abundance pattern. A possible weak-r or $\nu$p-process forming Sr-Zr but not Ba might have mixed into a low level of underlying r-process material in the low-mass LMS-1/Wukong system.</description>

      <title>Imaging and Radio Signatures of Shock-Plasmoid Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how shocks interact with coronal structures is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. Using simultaneous radio and white-light observations, we investigate the interaction between a CME-driven shock and a plasmoid. LASCO and STEREO-A COR-2 white-light images are analyzed to track the evolution of the plasmoid, CME and its associated shock, while the Wind/WAVES and STEREO/WAVES dynamic spectra provide complementary radio signatures of the shock-plasmoid interaction at $\approx$7 R$_\odot$. An interplanetary Type II radio burst was detected as the shock propagated through the plasmoid. The merging of the plasmoid into the CME was accompanied by interplanetary Type III radio bursts, suggesting escaping electron beams during the reconnection process. These observations clearly demonstrate that shock-plasmoid interactions can enhance the efficiency of particle acceleration associated with CMEs, with implications for electron acceleration in flare and heliospheric current sheets as well.</description>

      <title>CLEAN and multi-scale CLEAN for STIX in Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLEAN is a well-established deconvolution approach to Fourier imaging at both radio wavelwengths and hard X-ray energies. However, specifically for hard X-ray imaging, CLEAN suffers two significant drawbacks: a rather limited degree of automation, and a tendency to under-resolution. This paper introduces a multi-scale version of CLEAN specifically tailored to the reconstruction of images from measurements observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board Solar Orbiter. Using synthetic STIX data, this study shows that multi-scale CLEAN may represent a reliable solution to the two previously mentioned CLEAN limitations. Further, this paper shows the performances of CLEAN and its multi-scale release in reconstructing experimental real scenarios characterized by complex emission morphologies.</description>

      <title>Discovering Cataclysmic Variables from the Rubin Observatory LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a windfall of new transients and variable sources. Here we have performed mock observation simulations to understand LSST's expected detection rates for cataclysmic variables (CVs) with known large amplitude variations. Under the thin-disk approximation for the distribution of CVs in our Galaxy, we found that only 20% of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae systems, representing the most energetic disk-driven outbursts in CVs, will be detected during outbursts by the LSST. Given their large amplitude (7-9 mag), {only those} brighter than $17.5$ mag at outburst maximum are expected to have an r-band quiescence counterpart in individual scans. Thanks to the planned cadence of the LSST towards the Galactic center, ~70% of the simulated outbursts will be detected twice or more on the discovery night, and two-thirds will be observed in different bands. CVs of the Polar class, which display luminosity changes up to 4 mag, can be unbiasedly recovered to 22.5 mag with more than 100 detections over 10 years of the LSST operation. Finally, we attempt to characterize the detection rate of micronovae bursts, and find that about 2.6%} of the simulated sample will be observed as a &gt;= 0.4 mag-amplitude and &lt;= 1-d duration spike in the long-term light curve. Overall, our results consolidate LSST's capability to studying time-domain phenomena in CVs, and inform on how to plan and organize follow-up observation strategies on transients discovered by LSST.</description>

      <title>Testing the Role of Merging Binaries in the Formation of the Split Main Sequence in Young Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of theories have been put forward to explain the bi-modal stellar rotational distribution observed in young massive clusters. These include stellar mergers and interactions induced in binary systems, and the role of angular momentum transfer between a star and its circumstellar disk in its early evolution. Each theory predicts unique rotation distributions in various locations of the colour-magnitude diagram. Specifically, the stellar merger hypothesis posits that the upper end of the main sequence will host a significant number of slowly rotating merger products, essentially that the blue straggler stars are an extension of the blue main sequence. In the present work, we use observations of three massive ($\sim10^5$~\msun) young ($100-300$~Myr) clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud using a combination of HST photometry and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. We show that in all three clusters, these bright blue stars have stellar rotational distributions that differ significantly from that measured on the blue main sequence. We conclude that stellar mergers do not play a significant role in the formation of the split main sequence/bi-modal rotational distribution. As a corollary, we show that blue straggler stars in these YMCs display a wide range of rotational velocities.</description>

      <title>A survey for variable young stars with small telescopes: X -- Comparing stochastic YSO light curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light curves of young stars exhibit photometric variability over hours to decades and across a wide range of amplitudes. On time scales beyond a few rotation periods, these light curves are typically stochastic. The variability arises from a combination of accretion rate changes, line-of-sight extinction variations, and evolving spotted stellar surfaces. We aim to develop a methodology to quantitatively compare the full variability statistics of these inhomogeneously sampled light curves with model calculations. To achieve this, we converted the light curves into variability fingerprints. They map the probability of variation by a given amount over a given timescale. Applying principal component analysis to these fingerprints produces a stable distribution of the first two principal components. We show that this distribution is a continuum without clusters. Adding a model-generated fingerprint to an observational sample does not significantly alter the distribution of the sample, allowing a robust comparison between the model and observed light curves to assess statistical realism. We show that photometric uncertainties, timing, and observing cadence have a minimal impact on model placement within the observational distribution. The main source of variance among highly variable light curves of young stars is the timescale of the onset of significant variability (above 0.3mag), with 1-3month timescales being the most critical. The secondary cause of variance are long-term (above 1.5yr) dimming or rising trends.</description>

      <title>SN 2022xlp: The second-known well-observed, intermediate-luminosity Iax supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of type Iax supernova SN 2022xlp. With a V-band absolute magnitude light curve peaking at $M_{max}(V) = -16.04 \pm 0.25$ mag, this object is regarded as the second determined well-observed Iax supernova in the intermediate luminosity range after SN 2019muj. Our research aims to explore the question of whether the physical properties vary continuously across the entire luminosity range. We also investigate the chemical abundance profiles and the characteristic physical quantities of the ejecta, followed by tests of the predictions of hydro simulations. The pseudo-bolometric light curve was calculated using optical and UV (Swift UVOT ) light curves and fits with a radiation diffusion Arnett model to constrain the average optical opacity, ejected mass, and initial nickel mass produced in the explosion. We analyzed the color evolution of SN 2022xlp and compared it with that of other Iax supernovae with different peak luminosities. We used the spectral tomography method to determine the radial profiles of physical properties and abundances of the ejecta, comparing them with a set of hydrodynamic pure deflagration models. The estimated bolometric flux peaks at $8.87\times 10^{41}$ erg/s and indicates the production of radioactive nickel as $M(^{56}$Ni) = $0.0215 \pm 0.009\,M_{\odot}$. According to the best-fit model, the explosion energy is $(2.066 \pm 0.236) \times 10^{49}$ erg and the ejecta mass is $0.142 \pm 0.015\,M_{\odot}$. The performed spectral tomography analysis shows that the determined physical quantities agree well with the predictions of the deflagration simulations, with modifications regarding the increased Na abundance and the more massive outer layers. SN 2022xlp bridges the previously existing luminosity gap, and supports the assumption of continuous variation in the physical properties across the SN Iax subclass.</description>

      <title>Co-existence of longitudinal and transverse oscillations in polar plumes observed with Solar Orbiter/EUI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves play a key role in heating the solar corona and driving the solar wind. Recent observations have shown the presence of slow magneto-acoustic and Alfv\'enic waves in polar plumes and inter-plumes. However, a complete understanding of wave dynamics in the polar regions has long been limited by the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution observations. In this study, we utilize high spatial (210 km per pixel) and high cadence (5s) dataset from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter, acquired on 14 September 2021. Our findings reveal the simultaneous presence of slow magneto-acoustic and Alfv\'enic waves within the same polar plumes. For slow magneto-acoustic waves, the amplitudes of propagating disturbances are 1.4 to 3.2$\%$ of background intensity, with periodicities of 9 min, and the projected speed of these disturbances ranges between 115 to 125 kms$^{-1}$. The corresponding electron temperature in plumes ranges between 0.58 and 0.69 MK. The damping length of these propagating disturbances for five plumes is $\approx$2.4 to 7.1 Mm. The propagating disturbances are also detected in the fine-scale substructures within the plumes. Alfv\'enic waves, on the other hand, are detected with average displacement amplitude, periodicity, and velocity amplitudes of 165$\pm$82 km, 93$\pm$39 s, and 12$\pm$7 kms$^{-1}$ respectively. The ranges for displacement amplitude, period, and velocity amplitude are 50-600 km, 50-250 s, and 3-32 kms$^{-1}$ respectively. These results mark the first demonstration of Solar Orbiter/EUI's ability to simultaneously detect both slow magneto-acoustic and Alfv\'enic wave modes extending up to 20 Mm in polar plumes.</description>

      <title>What's the Buzz About GX 13+1? Constraining Coronal Geometry with QUEEN-BEE: A Bayesian Nested Sampling Framework for X-ray Polarization Rotation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have revealed electric vector position angle (EVPA) rotation in several neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, including the galactic X-ray burster GX 13+1. We developed a novel Bayesian nested sampling framework-"Q-U Event-by-Event Nested sampling for Bayesian EVPA Evolution" (QUEEN-BEE)-to model unbinned Stokes parameters and infer optimal EVPA rotation rates in IXPE data. We then applied this framework to three previous IXPE observations of GX 13+1. In the first observation, QUEEN-BEE recovers a rotation rate of 42+/-4 degrees/day, consistent with prior binned analysis. Energy-binned QUEEN-BEE analysis of this first observation suggests a slab-like coronal geometry, providing the first constraints between slab and shell coronae for this source. We also explore alternative EVPA rotation scenarios in GX 13+1 including variable disk wind behavior. The second observation of this source shows no evidence of rotation, and the third observation shows transient rotating behavior with an EVPA rotation rate when exiting a light curve dip of 170 +20/-40 degrees/day. The results show marginal but consistent increases in the overall measured polarization degree (PD) for epochs where the EVPA rotation is identified. These results demonstrate that QUEEN-BEE can identify evolving polarization signatures in both time- and energy-resolved regimes, even where binned methods fall below detection thresholds. Our findings highlight the diagnostic potential of QUEEN-BEE as a tool for discriminating between competing physical models of coronal geometry and probing disk-wind-related polarization behavior, highlighting the promising potential for application of this framework in a variety of other IXPE observations.</description>

      <title>Micro-Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters</title>

Abstract: Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical interactions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.</description>

      <title>The first radio view of a type Ibn supernova in SN 2023fyq: Understanding the mass-loss history in the last decade before the explosion</title>

Abstract: Supernovae that interact with hydrogen-poor, helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), known as Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn), present a unique opportunity to probe mass-loss processes in massive stars. In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\sim 10^{6} \mathrm{\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\sim$ $4 \times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\rm{\dot{M}}$ $&lt; 2.5\times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \times 10^{15}$ to $2 \times 10^{16}$ cm ($\sim 10^{5} R_{\rm{\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds: Observational Perspectives on Structure, Kinematics, and Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate interpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While our theory predicts a "characteristic" density for star formation, it also predicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed sample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given density bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing quasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time throughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column density and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably accurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore the freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column density plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate densities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to decrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our simulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find this is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and embedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is significantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the relative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several possible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the sky plane, resembling observed "coherent cores." We show that this "coherence" is a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law velocity structure function. We discuss possible ways to estimate line-of-sight path lengths.</description>

      <title>Resonant axion and dark photon production in magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using magnetic white dwarfs as a case study, we show that the emission of sub-MeV bosons from stellar plasmas can be substantially modified in the presence of a magnetic field. In particular, the magnetic field-induced anisotropy and cyclotron resonance both significantly affect the in-medium dispersion relations of the Standard Model photon. As a result, resonant level crossing between photons and other light bosons occurs under environmental conditions that differ from the resonance criteria in unmagnetized environments. We find that the magnetic field opens additional regions within magnetic white dwarfs where resonance can occur. These findings motivate revisiting astrophysical constraints on light bosons in systems where the cyclotron frequency is comparable to or larger than the plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Neutron Star Equation of State and Model Comparison: Insights from PSR J0437+4715, PSR J0614+3329, and Other Multi-Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) using a wide range of terrestrial and astrophysical data. The terrestrial inputs include quantities related to symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and symmetry energy up to two times saturation density ($\rho_0\sim$0.16 fm$^{-3}$), derived from finite nuclei and heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The astrophysical constraints incorporate NS radii and tidal deformabilities from recent NICER observations and GW170817, respectively. We consider five different EoS models: Taylor, $n/3$, Skyrme, RMF, and sound speed(CS), are analyzed by sequentially updating the priors with (i) $\chi$EFT based pure neutron matter, (ii) terrestrial, empirical and earlier astrophysical data, (iii) case (ii) including NICER radii of PSR J0437+4715 and J0614+3329, (iv) all data combined, and (v) excluding empirical nuclear inputs. We also perform Bayesian model comparison which favors the Skyrme model under all combined data (scenario (iv)), yielding tight constraints on symmetry energy parameters: $L_0 = 56 \pm 3$~MeV, $K_{\mathrm{sym}0} = -132 \pm 15$~MeV and also on SNM parameters: $K_0 = 265 \pm 12$~MeV, $Q_0 = -366 \pm 43$~MeV. The mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability posterior distributions are also well constrained. The radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star are found to be $R_{1.4} = 11.85 \pm 0.11$~km and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 354 \pm 25$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH): a spectrometer for the GRIPS-2 balloon campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a piggyback mission originally designed for the second flight of the Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS-2) Antarctic balloon. IMPISH will take measurements of collimated, full-Sun X-ray spectra with the goal of detecting sub-second variations (order of tens of milliseconds) of nonthermal X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of large solar flares to probe particle acceleration mechanisms driven by magnetic reconnection.
  The IMPISH detector system, made up of four identical detectors totaling 64 cm$^2$ effective area, is capable of measuring from ~10 keV to over 200 keV through the use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and LYSO scintillators. At the stratospheric altitude of GRIPS-2, the effective lower energy limit is ~20-30 keV. The geometry of the LYSO crystal has been optimized to balance the light collection efficiency with the effective area required for stratospheric X-ray measurements. Development of the IMPISH detectors has introduced a path for a low-cost solution to fast solar X-ray measurements across a large energy range utilizing commercially available components. The payload has a 3U form factor and has been designed so that both the electronics and detectors may be easily adaptable for space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>Feature Understanding and Sparsity Enhancement via 2-Layered kernel machines (2L-FUSE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel sparsity enhancement strategy for regression tasks, based on learning a data-adaptive kernel metric, i.e., a shape matrix, through 2-Layered kernel machines. The resulting shape matrix, which defines a Mahalanobis-type deformation of the input space, is then factorized via an eigen-decomposition, allowing us to identify the most informative directions in the space of features. This data-driven approach provides a flexible, interpretable and accurate feature reduction scheme. Numerical experiments on synthetic and applications to real datasets of geomagnetic storms demonstrate that our approach achieves minimal yet highly informative feature sets without losing predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Subspace Approximation to the Focused Transport Equation. II. The Modified Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles in a spatially varying magnetic field is described by the focused transport equation. In the past two versions of this equation were investigated. The more commonly used standard form described a pitch-angle isotropization process but does not conserve the norm. In the current paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form also called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the norm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously developed subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically and numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional subspace approximation. Furthermore, we consider a higher dimensionality for which one needs to evaluate occurring matrix exponentials numerically. This type of semi-numerical approach is much faster than traditional solvers and, therefore, it is very useful.</description>

      <title>One Year of SN 2023ixf: Breaking Through the Degenerate Parameter Space in Light-Curve Models with Pulsating Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze the extensive optical broadband photometry of the Type II SN 2023ixf up to one year after explosion. We find that, when compared to two pre-existing model grids, the bolometric light curve is consistent with drastically different combinations of progenitor and explosion properties. This may be an effect of known degeneracies in Type IIP light-curve models. We independently compute a large grid of $\texttt{MESA+STELLA}$ single-star progenitor and light-curve models with various zero-age main-sequence masses, mass-loss efficiencies, and convective efficiencies. Using the observed progenitor variability as an additional constraint, we select stellar models consistent with the pulsation period and explode them according to previously established scaling laws to match plateau properties. Our hydrodynamic modeling indicates that SN 2023ixf is most consistent with a moderate-energy ($E_{\rm exp}\approx7\times10^{50}$ erg) explosion of an initially high-mass red supergiant progenitor ($\gtrsim 16.5\ M_{\odot}$) that lost a significant amount of mass in its prior evolution, leaving a low-mass hydrogen envelope ($\lesssim 3\ M_{\odot}$) at the time of explosion, with a radius $\gtrsim 950\ R_{\odot}$ and a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $\approx0.068\ M_{\odot}$. We posit that previous mass transfer in a binary system may have stripped the envelope of SN 2023ixf's progenitor. The analysis method with pulsation period presented in this work offers a way to break degeneracies in light-curve modeling in the future, particularly with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, when a record of progenitor variability will be more common.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Auroral Spiral and Transpolar Arc: Polar UVI Observations and Global MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A local vortex-structured aurora and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI) when a substorm almost recovered, and the associated interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)BY and BZ polarities were negative and negative-to-positive. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of ~30 RE (spiral) and more than ~45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric and ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.</description>
