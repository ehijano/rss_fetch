      <title>Topological Origin of Andreev Flatland in UTe$_2$: Implication for Josephson STM Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the surface of topological superconductors as a platform for realizing two-dimensional flat bands, where electron interactions play a crucial role. The surface flat bands originate from topological features supported by two key mechanisms: (1) a trivial Chern number prevents the zero-energy states from merging into the continuum of the bulk spectrum, thereby ensuring their confinement within the superconducting gap; and (2) weak spin conservation allows the gap function to exhibit phase winding. As a consequence, the surface exhibits a remarkably high density of states at nearly zero energy. Such surface states are likely to be realized in the candidate topological superconductor UTe$_2$. Our results provide important insights into the interpretation of recent Josephson STM experiments on UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of compressively strained thin film La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the bulk nickelates under high pressure is a major advance in physics. The recent observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films has now enabled direct characterization of the superconducting phase through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here we present an in-situ ARPES study of compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ films grown by oxide molecular beam epitaxy, and the ozone treated counterparts with an onset T$_c$ of 40 K, supplemented with results from pulsed laser deposition films with similar T$_c$. We resolve a systematic strain-driven electronic band shift with respect to that of bulk crystals, in qualitative agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, the strongly renormalized flat 3$d_{z2}$ band shifts a factor of 5-10 smaller than anticipated by DFT. Furthermore, it stays ~70 meV below the Fermi level, contradicting the expectation that superconductivity results from the high density of states of this band at the Fermi level. We also observed a non-trivial k$_z$ dispersion of the cuprate-like 3$d_{x2-y2}$ band. Combined with results from both X-ray diffraction and DFT, we suggest that the strained films are under ~5 GPa effective pressure, considerably larger than the na\"ive expectation from the DFT relaxed structure. Finally, the ~70 meV energy position is intriguingly close to the collective mode coupling more prominently seen in thin films, in the energy range of both oxygen related phonons and the maximum of the spin excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and Electron Correlations in Kagome Metal LuOs3B2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of LuOs3B2, characterized by an ideal Os-based kagome lattice. Resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the emergence of type-II bulk superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc=4.63 K. The specific heat jump and the calculated electron-phonon coupling parameter support a moderately coupled superconducting state. Electron correlation effects are supported by the enhanced Wilson ratios. First-principles calculations reveal hallmark features of kagome band structure, including Dirac points, van Hove singularities, and quasi-flat bands, primarily derived from the Os d orbitals. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling opens a gap at the Dirac points, significantly altering the electronic properties. Furthermore, the superconductivity and electronic properties of isomorphic compounds are discussed. This work provides a thorough exploration of the superconducting and normal states of LuOs3B2, deepening the understanding of kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Gapfull and gapless $1$D Topological Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</description>

      <title>Potentiometric detection of spin polarization expected at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in the effective p-wave superconducting state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the quest for non-Abelian anyons is attracting tremendous attention. In particular, a Majorana quasiparticle has attracted great interest since the non-Abelian anyon is a key particle for topological quantum computation. Much effort has been paid for the quest of the Majorana state in solids, and some candidate material platforms are reported. Among various materials that can host the Majorana state, chiral p-wave superconductor is one of the suitable materials and the iron-based layered superconductor FeTeSe is one of the promising material platforms because its surface can host effective p-wave superconducting state that is analogous to chiral p-wave superconducting state thanks to its topological surface state. Given that a chiral p-wave superconductor possesses spin polarization, detecting the spin polarization can be evidence for the chiral p-wave trait, which results in the existence of Majorana excitation. Here, we show successful detection of the spin polarization at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in its superconducting state, where the spin polarization is detected via a potentiometric method. Amplitudes of the spin signal exhibit characteristic dependence for temperature and bias current, suggesting detection of spin polarization of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our achievement opens a new avenue to explore topological superconductivity for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the successful simulation of $\sqrt{Z}$-, $\sqrt{X}$- and $X$-quantum gates using Majorana zero modes (MZMs) that emerge in magnetic vortices located in topological superconductors. We compute the transition probabilities and geometric phase differences accounting for the full many-body dynamics and show that qubit states can be read out by fusing the vortex core MZMs and measuring the resulting charge density. We visualize the gate processes using the time- and energy-dependent non-equilibrium local density of states. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing vortex core MZMs for the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity (SC) in the trilayer nickelate compound La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has generated significant interest. In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of Josephson junction arrays for multi-order quantum voltage steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07835v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of overdamped Josephson junctions under varying microwave-driving conditions have been studied through numerical simulations using the resistively-shunted junction (RSJ) model, with a focus on primary voltage metrology applications, where a significantly high number of series-connected junctions and stringent uniformity of their electrical parameters are required. The aim is to determine the optimal junction characteristics and external microwave (rf) parameters that maximize the width of quantum voltage levels (Shapiro steps) from order $n=0$ to $n &gt; 1$. Both the rf and dc power requirements, along with the junction parameter spread and power attenuation, are analyzed as key factors that need to be optimized for improved performance of the quantum device. This work aims to advance the development of next-generation Programmable Josephson Voltage Standards (PJVS) with logic architectures that surpass the conventional binary and ternary codifications used in present quantum voltage arrays, while significantly reducing the overall number of junctions as well as the number of sub-arrays and bias lines. Existing technologies exploiting $n = 0$ and $n = \pm 1$ voltage steps are first discussed and analyzed to verify the validity of the simulation model. They are then further investigated to extend their usability with multi-order quantum steps for $n$ up to 3. From the simulation results, it follows that present junction technologies may be employed with no modifications for the simultaneous operation of quantum steps up to $n=2$, although optimal power efficiency would require a retrimming of the junction's electrical parameters. On the contrary, extending the highest step order to $n=3$ strictly requires the junction's characteristic parameters to be properly adjusted to maintain sustainable power levels as well as acceptable quantum-locking ranges.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams and two key factors to superconductivity of RP nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has drawn great attention. Many works have been done to study the superconductivity as well as to find more superconducting RP nickelates. However, there is a lack of general understanding regarding the key factors that contribute to the superconductivity of RP nickelates. Here, we systematically study the series of RP nickelates under doping or high-pressure conditions by means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting RP nickelates, suggesting that they are crucial to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into phase diagrams with local spin moment and local entanglement entropy as parameters, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished. At last, we predict a promising candidate for superconducting RP nickelates, which is constructed in a "bilayer-trilayer" stacking sequence.</description>
