      <title>Generative AI models enable efficient and physically consistent sea-ice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a 12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations, exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.</description>

      <title>Numerical models outperform AI weather forecasts of record-breaking extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast (HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.</description>

      <title>CuMoLoS-MAE: A Masked Autoencoder for Remote Sensing Data Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves long-term climate reanalysis.</description>

      <title>Improving Predictions of Convective Storm Wind Gusts through Statistical Post-Processing of Neural Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Issuing timely severe weather warnings helps mitigate potentially disastrous consequences. Recent advancements in Neural Weather Models (NWMs) offer a computationally inexpensive and fast approach for forecasting atmospheric environments on a 0.25{\deg} global grid. For thunderstorms, these environments can be empirically post-processed to predict wind gust distributions at specific locations. With the Pangu-Weather NWM, we apply a hierarchy of statistical and deep learning post-processing methods to forecast hourly wind gusts up to three days ahead. To ensure statistical robustness, we constrain our probabilistic forecasts using generalised extreme-value distributions across five regions in Switzerland. Using a convolutional neural network to post-process the predicted atmospheric environment's spatial patterns yields the best results, outperforming direct forecasting approaches across lead times and wind gust speeds. Our results confirm the added value of NWMs for extreme wind forecasting, especially for designing more responsive early-warning systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal Inertia Controls on Titan's Surface Temperature and Planetary Boundary Layer Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding Titan's planetary boundary layer (PBL)-the lowest region of the atmosphere influenced by surface conditions-remains challenging due to Titan's thick atmosphere and limited observations. Previous modeling studies have produced inconsistent estimates of surface temperature variability, a critical determinant of PBL behavior, often without clear explanations grounded in surface energy balance. Here, we develop a theoretical framework and apply a three-dimensional dry general circulation model (GCM) to investigate how surface thermal inertia influences surface energy balance and temperature variability across diurnal and seasonal timescales. At diurnal timescales, lower thermal inertia surfaces experience larger temperature fluctuations and enhanced daytime sensible heat fluxes due to less efficient subsurface heat conduction. In contrast, at seasonal timescales, surface temperature variations show weak sensitivity to thermal inertia, as atmospheric damping tends to dominate over subsurface conduction. The PBL depth ranges from a few hundred meters to 1,000m on diurnal timescales, while seasonal maxima reach 2,000m, supporting the interpretation from a previous study that the Huygens probe captured the two PBL structures. Simulated seasonal winds at the Huygens landing site successfully reproduce key observed features, including near-surface retrograde winds and meridional wind reversals within the lowest few kilometers, consistent with Titan's cross-equatorial Hadley circulation. Simulations for the planned Dragonfly landing site predict shallower thermal PBLs with smaller fluctuation amplitudes, while maintaining similar wind patterns. This work establishes a physically grounded framework for understanding Titan's surface temperature and boundary layer variability, and offers a unified explanation of Titan's PBL behavior that provides improved guidance for future missions.</description>
