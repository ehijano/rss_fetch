      <title>Confinement-Driven Acceleration of First-Passage Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that confinement geometry can act as a rectifier in passive diffusion, optimally accelerating first-passage rates beyond free diffusion. Using analytic theory based on the Fick-Jacobs approach and Brownian dynamics simulations, we find nonmonotonic mean first-passage rates driven by entropy. Through the transmission probability, our findings highlight how confinement optimizes transport dynamics in trap-and-escape processes, with implications for molecular translocation and reaction kinetics in soft matter and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Extremal events dictate population growth rate inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent methods have been developed to map single-cell lineage statistics to population growth. Because population growth selects for exponentially rare phenotypes, these methods inherently depend on sampling large deviations from finite data, which introduces systematic errors. A comprehensive understanding of these errors in the context of finite data remains elusive. To address this gap, we study the error in growth rate estimates across different models. We show that under the usual bias-variance decomposition, the bias can be decomposed into a finite-time bias and nonlinear averaging bias. We demonstrate that finite-time bias, which dominates at short times, can be mitigated by fitting its monotonic behavior. In contrast, at longer times, nonlinear averaging bias becomes the predominant source of error, leading to a phase transition. This transition can be understood through the Random Energy Model, a mean-field model of disordered systems, where a few lineages dominate the estimator. Applying these methods to experimental data demonstrates that correcting for biases in lineage-based approaches yields consistent results for the long-term growth rate across multiple methods and enables the reverse-engineering of dynamic models. This new framework provides a quantitative understanding of growth rate estimators, clarifies the conditions under which they can be effectively applied to finite data, and introduces model-free approaches for studying the connections between physiology and cell growth.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe recent applications of artificial intelligence and in particular machine learning to active matter systems. Active matter is composed of agents, or particles, that are capable of propelling themselves. While biological agents like bacteria, fish or birds naturally possess a certain degree of "intelligence", synthetic active particles like colloidal microswimmers and electronic robots can be equipped with different levels of artificial intelligence, either internally (as for robots) or via a dynamic external control system. This book chapter briefly discusses existing approaches to make synthetic particles increasingly "intelligent" and then focuses on the usage of machine learning to approach navigation and communication problems of active particles. Basic questions are how to steer a single active agent through a complex environment to reach or discover a target in an optimal way and how active particles need to cooperate to efficiently collect a distribution of targets (e.g. nutrients or toxins) from their complex environment.</description>

      <title>Investigation on non-ergodicity of protein dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of microscopic protein dynamics has historically presented significant challenges to researchers seeking to develop a comprehensive and detailed description of its diverse and intriguing features. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have proposed the hypothesis that protein dynamics may be non-ergodic. The implications of this finding are of paramount importance from both a practical and theoretical standpoint. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to examine these results over a time window spanning from picoseconds to nanoseconds. To this end, we utilize widely used statistical tools. Our findings challenge the conclusions of previous studies, which suggested that proteins exhibit non-ergodic dynamics. Instead, we demonstrate that deviations from ergodic behavior are due to incomplete convergence of the investigated quantities. Additionally, we discuss the implications of findings that suggest a potential breaking of the ergodic hypothesis over larger time windows, which were not directly investigated in this study.</description>

      <title>General Solution for Elastic Networks on Arbitrary Curved Surfaces in the Absence of Rotational Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding crystal growth over arbitrary curved surfaces with arbitrary boundaries is a formidable challenge, stemming from the complexity of formulating non-linear elasticity using geometric invariant quantities. Solutions are generally confined to systems exhibiting rotational symmetry. In this paper, we introduce a framework to address these challenges by numerically solving these equations without relying on inherent symmetries. We illustrate our approach by computing the minimum energy required for an elastic network containing a disclination at any point and by investigating surfaces that lack rotational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the transition from a defect-free structure to a stable state with a single 5-fold or 7-fold disclination strongly depends on the shape of the domain, emphasizing the profound influence of edge geometry. We discuss the implications of our results for general experimental systems, particularly in elucidating the assembly pathways of virus capsids. This research enhances our understanding of crystal growth on complex surfaces and expands its applications across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Female and Combined Male-Female Injury Risk Functions for the Anterior Pelvis Under Frontal Lap Belt Loading Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Iliac wing fractures due to lap belt loading have been observed in laboratory settings for 50 years and recent data suggest they are also occurring in the field. Automated driving systems (ADS) and other occupant compartment advancements are expected to offer enhanced flexibility in seating orientation, which could place a greater reliance on the seatbelt to restrain occupants. Such changes may increase seatbelt loads and create new challenges in successfully restraining occupants and mitigating injury to areas such as the pelvis. Injury criteria exist for component-level male iliac wing fractures resulting from frontal lap belt loading, but not for females. Methods: This study explored female iliac wing fracture tolerance in the same loading environment as a previous study that explored the fracture tolerance of isolated male iliac wings. Male and female fracture data were combined to evaluate the effect of sex. Injury risk functions were created by fitting Weibull survival models to data that integrated censored and exact failure observations. Results: Twenty female iliac wings were tested; fourteen of them sustained fracture with known failure forces (exact), but the remaining six wings either (1) did not fracture, or (2) fractured after an event that changed the boundary conditions (right censored). The fracture tolerance of the tested specimens ranged widely (1134 - 8759 N) and averaged 4240 N (SD 2516 N). Conclusion: Female data and combined male-female data were analyzed. Age was the only covariate investigated in this study that had a statistically significant effect and improved the predictive performance of the models.</description>

      <title>WeTICA: A directed search weighted ensemble based enhanced sampling method to estimate rare event kinetics in a reduced dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating rare event kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations is a non-trivial task despite the great advances in enhanced sampling methods. Weighted Ensemble (WE) simulation, a special class of enhanced sampling techniques, offers a way to directly calculate kinetic rate constants from biased trajectories without the need to modify the underlying energy landscape using bias potentials. Conventional WE algorithms use different binning schemes to partition the collective variable (CV) space separating the two metastable states of interest. In this work, we have developed a new "binless" WE simulation algorithm to bypass the hurdles of optimizing binning procedures. Our proposed protocol (WeTICA) uses a low-dimensional CV space to drive the WE simulation toward the specified target state. We have applied this new algorithm to recover the unfolding kinetics of three proteins: (A) TC5b Trp-cage mutant, (B) TC10b Trp-cage mutant, and (C) Protein G, with unfolding times spanning the range between 3 and 40 {\mu}s using projections along predefined fixed Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) eigenvectors as CVs. Calculated unfolding times converge to the reported values with good accuracy with more than one order of magnitude less cumulative WE simulation time than the unfolding time scales with or without a priori knowledge of the CVs that can capture unfolding. Our algorithm can be used with other linear CVs, not limited to TICA. Moreover, the new walker selection criteria for resampling employed in this algorithm can be used on more sophisticated nonlinear CV space for further improvements of binless WE methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic insights into Z-ring formation and stability: A Langevin dynamics approach to FtsZ self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tubulin-like protein FtsZ is crucial for cytokinesis in bacteria and many archaea, forming a ring-shaped structure called the Z-ring at the site of cell division. Despite extensive research, the self-assembly of Z-rings is not entirely understood. We propose a theoretical model based on FtsZ's known filament structures, treating them as semiflexible polymers with specific mechanical properties and lateral inter-segment attraction that can stabilize ring formations. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal various morphological phases, including open helices, chains, rings, and globules, capturing experimental observations in the fission yeast model using FtsZ from different bacterial species or mutants of Escherichia coli. Using our theoretical model, we explore how treadmilling activity affects Z-ring stability and identify a spooling mechanism of ring formation. The active ring produces contractile, shear, and rotational stresses, which intensify as the Z-ring transitions to an open helix at high activity.</description>
