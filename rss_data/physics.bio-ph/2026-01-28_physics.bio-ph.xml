      <title>Intermediate physical interactions induce spatiotemporal dynamics in Turing patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turing patterns are a central paradigm for describing spatial patterns in nature. The corresponding theory of reaction-diffusion dynamics combines ideal diffusion with nonlinear reactions, resulting in patterns when species diffuse at different rates and reactions are sufficiently nonlinear. However, real systems are more complex and particularly involve physical interactions between constituents. While such interactions can promote patterns, we here show that they can also induce dynamic, chaotic patterns. These patterns exhibit well-defined length and time scales, which result from cycles of droplet coarsening and fission. The dynamical patterns combine properties of traditional Turing patterns and chemically active droplets, which emerge for strong physical interactions. Our analysis thus reveals three qualitatively different regimes that emerge when two components interact physically and undergo nonlinear reactions.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate ligands that bind strongly and specifically to target protein pockets. Recent diffusion models have advanced SBDD by capturing the distributions of atomic positions and types, yet they often underemphasize binding affinity control during generation. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{\textnormal{\textbf{BADGER}}}, a general \textbf{binding-affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in SBDD}. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} }incorporates binding affinity awareness through two complementary strategies: (1) \textit{classifier guidance}, which applies gradient-based affinity signals during sampling in a plug-and-play fashion, and (2) \textit{classifier-free guidance}, which integrates affinity conditioning directly into diffusion model training. Together, these approaches enable controllable ligand generation guided by binding affinity. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} } can be added to any diffusion model and achieves up to a \textbf{60\% improvement in ligand--protein binding affinity} of sampled molecules over prior methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework to \textbf{multi-constraint diffusion guidance}, jointly optimizing for binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA) to design realistic and synthesizable drug candidates.</description>

      <title>Passive cell body plays active roles in microalgal swimming via nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cell body of flagellated microalgae is commonly considered to act merely as a passive load during swimming, and a larger body size would simply reduce the speed. In this work, we use numerical simulations based on a boundary element method to investigate the effect of body-flagella hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) on the swimming performance of the biflagellate, \textit{C. reinhardtii}. We find that body-flagella HIs significantly enhance the swimming speed and efficiency. As the body size increases, the competition between the enhanced HIs and the increased viscous drag leads to an optimal body size for swimming. Based on the simplified three-sphere model, we further demonstrate that the enhancement by body-flagella HIs arises from an effective non-reciprocity: the body affects the flagella more strongly during the power stroke, while the flagella affect the body more strongly during the recovery stroke. Our results have implications for both microalgal swimming and laboratory designs of biohybrid microrobots.</description>

      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>
