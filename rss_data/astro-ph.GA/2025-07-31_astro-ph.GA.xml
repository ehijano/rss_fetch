      <title>Thick-to-thin disc transition and gas disc shrinking induced by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the Milky Way disc formation requires characterising its structural and kinematic properties as functions of stellar age. Using red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar kinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc parameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a transition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older than this have short scale lengths ($\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc, while younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age, consistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition coincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length, even shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation suggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the transition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc formation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2) the GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the Galaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption led to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc grows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows via hot-mode smooth gas accretion.</description>

      <title>The Emergence and Ionizing Feedback of Pop III.1 Stars as Progenitors for Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by JWST reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of rapidly growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe, underscoring the need for improved models for their origin and growth. Employing new full radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, we investigate the local and intergalactic feedback of SMBH progenitors for the Population III.1 scenario, i.e., efficient formation of supermassive stars from pristine, undisturbed dark matter minihalos. Our cosmological simulations capture the R-type expansion phase of these Pop III.1 stars, with their H-ionizing photon luminosities of $\sim10^{53}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ generating HII regions that extend deep into the intergalactic medium, reaching comoving radii of $r_{\rm HII}\sim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$. We vary both the Pop III.1 ionization flux and cosmological formation environments, finding the former regulates their final $r_{\rm HII}$, whereas the latter is more important in setting their formation redshift. We use the results from our radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the cosmic number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}$, expected from Pop III.1 progenitors. We find $n_{\rm SMBH}\sim10^{-1}\,{\rm cMpc}^{-3}$, consistent with the results inferred from recent observations of the local and high redshift universe. Overall, this establishes Pop III.1 progenitors as viable candidates for the formation of the first SMBHs, and emphasises the importance of exploring heavy mass seed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Capturing star formation activity from compressed photometric images of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for classifying star-forming galaxies using photometric images. By utilizing approximately $124,000$ optical color composite images and spectroscopic data of nearby galaxies at $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.06$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, along with follow-up spectroscopic line measurements from the OSSY catalog, and leveraging the Vision Transformer machine-learning technique, we demonstrate that galaxy images in JPEG format alone can be directly used to determine whether star-forming activity dominates the galaxy, bypassing traditional spectroscopic analyses such as emission-line diagnostic diagrams. We anticipate that this method holds significant potential for application in current and future large-scale surveys, such as Euclid, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</description>

      <title>Origin of the ~150 kpc radio filament in galaxy ESO 137-006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensitive wide-field radio surveys have started uncovering many filamentary structures associated with the jets and lobes of radio galaxies, radio relics in galaxy clusters, and tailed galaxies. Although limited theoretical investigations on the origin of the filamentary structures have associated these filaments with astrophysical shocks and interactions with intracluster magneto-ionic media, more quantitative studies are needed to ascertain their precise nature and origin. Recent MeerKAT observations found peculiar filamentary structures (threaded radio structures) joining the lobes of a nearby FRII-like galaxy, ESO 137-006. Here we investigate the origin of these "synchrotron threads" to understand if they may be confined magnetically and could arise due to shocks associated with jet activity. Through simulation- and theory-based analysis, we find that the dynamical time (~70 Myr) associated with the shock front closely matches the estimated synchrotron age (~130 Myr) of the threads, thus making the shock origin hypothesis a favorable scenario for this particular filament.</description>

      <title>SHELLQs-JWST perspective on the intrinsic mass relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies at z &gt; 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z &gt; 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 &lt; z &lt; 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log MBH ~ 8-9; log M* ~9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_{-0.28}^{+0.23} dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex). Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties, an assumption on the slope of the mass relation, and finds a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in MBH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex) and a lower AGN fraction (~0.6%). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.</description>

      <title>Chandra X-ray Observatory study of the X-ray emission of PKS 0023-26 and comparison with recent ALMA results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep high-resolution Chandra X-ray Observatory image data of a powerful compact radio source PKS 0023-26 associated with a quasar at redshift 0.322. The earlier studies of the optical environment suggested that the source could be located in a galaxy cluster or a group. However, we report a non-detection of hot gas on large scales (out to $\sim 60$ kpc radius) and place an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of $&lt;3\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent only with the presence of a poor, low-temperature ($\rm kT &lt; 0.5$ keV) galaxy group. X-ray spectral analysis of the central circular region, $r&lt;7$ kpc shows, in addition to the mildly absorbed AGN, a thermal emission component with a temperature of $\rm kT=0.9^{+0.19}_{-0.37}$ keV. We discuss the origin of this hot component as a result of interaction between the evolving radio source and the interstellar medium. Our high angular resolution X-ray image traces the distribution of hot gas which is closely aligned with and extends beyond the radio source, and also in the direction perpendicular to the radio source axis. The X-rays are enhanced at the northern radio lobe and the location of the peak of the CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) line emission, suggesting that the interactions between the jet and cold medium result in the X-ray radiation which excites CO. The shock driven by the jet into the ISM is supersonic with the Mach number of $\mathcal{M} \sim 1.75-2$, creating the cocoon of hot X-rays surrounding the radio source. This result agrees with observations of shocks in other radio galaxies pointing to a prevalent impact of jets on ISM.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Triples vs. Globular Clusters: Binary black hole merger eccentricity distributions compete and evolve with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation mechanisms of merging binary black holes (BBHs) observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration remain uncertain. Detectable eccentricity provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing between different formation channels, but resolving their eccentricity distributions requires the detection of a large number of eccentric mergers. Future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will detect tens of thousands of BBH mergers out to redshifts $z \ge 10$, making it critical to understand the redshift-dependent evolution of eccentricity distributions. We simulate this evolution for two key channels: dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), which leads to rapid, eccentric mergers; and hierarchical triples in the field, where three-body dynamics can induce eccentricity in the inner binary. When considering all BBH mergers, the GC channel dominates overall, consistent with previous studies. However, when focusing on mergers with detectable eccentricity in next-generation detectors, we find that hierarchical triples dominate the eccentric merger rate at $0\le z \le 4$, with GC mergers becoming competitive at higher redshifts. Across all model variations, eccentric mergers in the local Universe ($z\lesssim 1$) have significant contributions from field triples, challenging the common view that such systems primarily form in dense environments. We show that, regardless of cluster and stellar evolution uncertainties, hierarchical triples contribute at least 30 per cent of eccentric mergers across a large range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Pair of Galaxies with Both Hosting X-ray Binary Candidates at $z=2.544$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among high-redshift galaxies, aside from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), X-ray binaries (XRBs) can be significant sources of X-ray emission. XRBs play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, reflecting the stellar populations of galaxies and regulating star formation through feedback, thereby shaping galaxy structure. In this study, we report a spectroscopically confirmed X-ray emitting galaxy pair (UDF3 and UDF3-2) at $z = 2.544$. By combining multi-wavelength observations from JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectra, JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging, Chandra, HST, VLT, ALMA, and VLA, we analyze the ionized emission lines, which are primarily driven by H II region-like processes. Additionally, we find that the mid-infrared radiation can be fully attributed to dust emission from galaxy themselves. Our results indicate that the X-ray emission from these two galaxies is dominated by high-mass XRBs, with luminosities of $L_X= (1.43\pm0.40) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3, and $(0.40\pm0.12) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3-2. Furthermore, we measure the star formation rate (SFR) of $529_{-88}^{+64}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for UDF3, placing it $\approx$ 0.5 dex below the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This offset reflects the redshift-dependent enhancement of $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation, which is influenced by metallicity and serves as a key observable for XRB evolution. In contrast, UDF3-2, with the SFR of $34_{-6}^{+6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, aligns well with the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This galaxy pair represents the highest-redshift non-AGN-dominated galaxies with individual X-ray detections reported to date. This finding suggests that the contribution of XRBs to galaxy X-ray emission at high redshift may be underestimated.</description>

      <title>AGN Feedback Efficiency of NAL Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider if outflowing winds that are detected via narrow absorption lines (NALs) with FWHM of $&lt;$ 500 km/s (i.e., NAL outflows) in quasar spectra contribute to feedback. As our sample, we choose 11 NAL systems in eight optically luminous quasars from the NAL survey of Misawa et al. (2007a), based on the following selection criteria: i) they exhibit ``partial coverage'' suggesting quasar origin (i.e., intrinsic NALs), ii) they have at least one low-ionization absorption line (C II and/or Si II), and iii) the Ly$\alpha$ absorption line is covered by available spectra. The results depend critically on this selection method, which has caveats and uncertainties associated with it, as we discuss in a dedicated section of the paper. Using the column density ratio of the excited and ground states of C II and Si II, we place upper limits on the electron density as $n_{\rm e}$ $&lt;$ 0.2 - 18 cm$^{-3}$ and lower limits on their radial distance from the flux source $R$ as greater than several hundreds of kpc. We also calculate lower limits on the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of $\log(\dot{M}/{\rm M_{\odot}~s}^{-1}) &gt; 79$ - (3.1$\times 10^{5})$ and $\log(\dot{E_{\rm k}}/{\rm erg~s}^{-1}) &gt; 42.9$ - 49.8, respectively. Taking the NAL selection and these results at face value, the inferred feedback efficiency can be comparable to or even larger than those of broad absorption line and other outflow classes, and large enough to generate significant AGN feedback. However, the question of the connection of quasar-driven outflows to NAL absorbers at large distances from the central engine remains open and should be addressed by future theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Classifying Compact Radio Emission in Nearby Galaxies: a 10GHz Study of Active Galactic Nuclei, Supernovae, Anomalous Microwave Emission and Star Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 115 compact radio point sources in three galaxies, NGC 5474, NGC 4631 and M51, taken in the most extended (A-)configuration of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 10GHz. Several of these compact radio point sources have diffuse counterparts identified in previous multi-band studies of resolved radio continuum emission. We find compact counterparts to eight star forming regions, four anomalous microwave emission candidates, and one supernova remnant (SN 2011dh). Nine of the compact radio sources match X-ray counterparts, the majority of which are background galaxies. These AGN are all within the D25 (isophotal diameter) of the host galaxy and might act as contaminants for X-ray binary population studies, highlighting the need for high-resolution multi-band imaging. This study showcases the broad number of science cases that require sensitive radio facilities, like the upcoming Square Kilometre Array and the planned next generation Very Large Array.</description>

      <title>EMU and the DRAGNs I: A Catalogue of DRAGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of 3557 Double Radio sources associated with Active Galactic Nuclei (DRAGNs) from the First Pilot Survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU), observed at 944 MHz with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, covering 270 deg^2. We have extracted and identified each source by eye, tagged it with a morphological type and measured its parameters. The resulting catalogue will be used in subsequent papers to explore the properties of these sources, to train machine-learning algorithms for the detection of these sources in larger fields, and to compare with the results of Citizen Science projects, with the ultimate goal of understanding the physical processes that drive DRAGNs. Compared with earlier, lower sensitivity, catalogues, we find more diffuse structure and a plethora of more complex structures, ranging from wings of radio emission on the side of the jets, to types of object which have not been seen in earlier observations. As well as the well-known FR1 and FR2 sources, we find significant numbers of rare types of radio source such as Hybrid Morphology Radio Sources and one-sided jets, as well as a wide range of bent-tail and head-tail sources.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Observations of the Wide Angle Tail Radio Galaxy J1712$-$2435</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present full polarization MeerKAT images of the wide-angle tail, giant radio galaxy J1712$-$2435 at 1.3 GHz with 7.\asec5 resolution and an RMS sensitivity of 8 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Due to the angular proximity to the Galactic Center (l=359.6$^\circ$, b=+8.5$^\circ$) the immediate environment is not well understood but there are massive clusters nearby. Emission can be traced over an extent of 34.\amin6 which at the redshift of 0.024330 corresponds to a projected length of 1.02 Mpc. The inner jets are quite straight but then bend and completely decollimate into extended plumes nearly orthogonal to the initial jet directions at a projected distance of approximately 100 kpc. The nearly unity brightness ratio of the inner jets suggest that they are orientated within a few degrees of the plane of the sky. The 1400 MHz power is 3.9$\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, somewhat below the FRI/FRII divide. The total power emitted is estimated to be 5.6$\times 10^{41}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ over the range 10 MHz to 100 GHz. The source dynamics are modeled with magneto-hydrodynamics simulations; the result is a rough reproduction of the source's radio morphology / appearance. This study further highlights the merit of alternative scenarios, calling for future observational and numerical efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Latest papers on the rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy, i. e. Ou et al. (2024); Jiao et al. (2023); Sylos Labini et al. (2023) suggest a Keplerian decrease in the rotation curve. This behavior is not consistent with other spiral galaxies (Lelli et al. 2016; Mistele et al. 2024). Aims. Show that the prior use of the axisymmetric Jeans equation is not consistent with the final model produced in the papers. Methods. Comparison of the results on gravitational potential in Ou et al. (2024); Jiao et al. (2023); Sylos Labini et al. (2023) with the prior assumptions about the axisymemtric properties of the Milky Way galaxy. Results. The gravitational potentials published by Ou et al. (2024); Jiao et al. (2023); Sylos Labini et al. (2023) lead to almost spherically symmetric properties of the Milky Way galaxy at Galactocentric radii above 20 kpc, which is not consistent with the use of axisymmetric Jeans equations.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter Class II methanol masers near the massive protostar S255IR NIRS3: evolution and excitation of the $J_1 -J_0$ A$^{-+}$ series and a new maser line at 345.919 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the further investigation of the Class II methanol maser emission in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ transition at 349.1 GHz discovered in 2016 in the remarkable core S255IR-SMA1, harboring a $\sim$20 M$_\odot$ protostar NIRS3, which exhibited a disk-mediated accretion burst in 2015. The present study is based on the observations of this object with ALMA in Band 7 at the largest baselines, which provide the angular resolution of $\sim$15 mas. We estimated physical conditions in the region from which comes the maser emission, and in the surroundings, using the presumably quasi-thermal methanol lines in our bands and the CH$_3$CN $19_\mathrm{K} - 18_\mathrm{K}$ line series. The total flux density in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ line in 2021 is about two times higher than in 2019. A maser emission of about the same intensity in 2021 is detected for the first time in the $12_1 - 12_0$ A$^{-+}$ transition at 336.9 GHz. The physical conditions in the masering and non-masering regions are similar. The masers are apparently excited by the radiation of the central source. Unfortunately, the existing models cannot adequately take into account this radiation. The $18_{-3}-17_{-4}$ E transition at 345.919 GHz shows characteristics of maser emission, too.</description>

      <title>The JWST Unveils the Bimodal Nature of Lyman Alpha Emitters at 3 &lt;z&lt;7: Pristine versus Merger-Driven Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of merging galaxies among Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution imaging data. From a large sample of 817 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $3&lt;z&lt;7$ in the GOODS-S field, we identify late-stage mergers and interacting systems with fractions of $39.4\%\pm2.5\%$ and $60.6\%\pm6.3\%$, respectively. These fractions exhibit significant redshift evolution and depend on both stellar mass ($M_*$) and UV magnitude ($M_{\rm UV}$), being most prevalent in massive ($\log(M_*/M_\odot)&gt;8.5$) and bright ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-19.5$) systems. At fixed $M_*$ and $M_{\rm UV}$, we find negligible differences in the UV slope ($\beta$) between late-stage mergers and isolated LAEs; however, a clear bimodal distribution emerges in the $M_*$-sSFR plane, where isolated LAEs peak at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\approx7.8$ and $\log({\rm sSFR/yr^{-1}})\approx-7.4$, and late-stage mergers peak at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\approx8.6$ and $\log({\rm sSFR/yr^{-1}})\approx-7.6$. Our results reveal two evolutionary classes -- Pristine LAEs, low-mass ($M_*&lt;10^{8.5}M_\odot$), isolated systems that represent early-stage galaxies with minimal merger interactions, and Merger-driven LAEs, massive ($M_*&gt;10^{8.5}M_\odot$) systems in which mergers enhance star formation and facilitate the escape of Lyman-alpha photons or accrete pristine LAEs -- both of which are consistent with both observational and theoretical expectations and collectively demonstrate that mergers are a central driver of LAE evolution across the first two billion years.</description>

      <title>Modeling turbulent and self-gravitating fluids with Fourier neural operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) are a leading method for surrogate modeling of partial differential equations. Unlike traditional neural networks, which approximate individual functions, NOs learn the mappings between function spaces. While NOs have been predominantly tested on simplified 1D and 2D problems, such as those explored in prior works, these studies fail to address the complexities of more realistic, high-dimensional, and high-dynamic range systems. Moreover, many real-world applications involve incomplete or noisy data, which has not been adequately explored in current NO literature. In this work, we present a novel application of NOs to astrophysical data, which involves high-dynamic range projections into an observational space. We train Fourier NO (FNO) models to predict the evolution of incomplete observational proxies with density variations spanning four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate that FNOs can predict the effects of unobserved dynamical variables. Our work lays the groundwork for future studies that forecast direct astronomical observables.</description>

      <title>High-redshift Galaxies from JWST Observations in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \simeq 8$--$10$ reveals that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly improved agreement with observations even within standard $\Lambda$CDM, with statistical consistency within $1$--$2\sigma$ for moderate star formation efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges, particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate apparent tensions between JWST observations and $\Lambda$CDM predictions, highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics in early cosmic epochs.</description>

      <title>Lord of LRDs: Insights into a "Little Red Dot'' with a low-ionization spectrum at z = 0.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z &gt; 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.</description>

      <title>How Massive Star Clusters Form and Evolve: A Near-IR Survey of the W51 Complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present near-infrared JHKs and narrow-band H2(1-0) photometric observations of the W51A region, obtained with GTC EMIR, aiming to characterize its young stellar population and provide mass estimates for individual cluster members and the proto-clusters. Our observations reveal over 3000 new sources, out of which 88 are located in the proto-clusters, W51 IRS2 and W51 Main. The average extinction (AV), measured from the J-H color, of sources is 19 AV in W51 IRS2 and 14 AV in W51 Main. We document 17 new instances of H2 emission in the region by utilizing observations from the H2(1-0) narrow-band filter. Despite limited completeness, we estimated masses for each cluster member and estimated the total cluster mass to be in the range of 900-4700 solar masses for W51 IRS2 and 500-2700 solar masses for W51 Main, using an assumed age range of 1-3 Myr. We measured the initial mass function (IMF) in the proto-clusters assuming a range of ages from 1-3 Myr and found that the IMF slopes for both proto-clusters are consistent with the Salpeter IMF in the mass range greater than or equal to 8 solar masses within 1 to 2 sigma.</description>

      <title>Mass Determination of Supermassive Black Holes Governing Evolution of Radio Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) often exhibit radio emission, yet its physical origin remains uncertain, especially in non-jetted cases. In this Letter, we formulate a general dynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and expanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH gravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing equations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling emerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to thermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the classical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our analysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell expansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell. This approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass estimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and probing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz monitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within months of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation mapping.</description>

      <title>Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Accretion Regimes of Neutrino-Cooled Flows onto Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red' super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an updated test for modifications of gravity from a sample of wide-binary stars from Gaia DR3, and their sky-projected relative velocities. Here we extend on our earlier 2023 study, using several updated selection cuts aimed at reducing contamination from triple systems with an undetected third star. We also use improved mass estimates from Gaia FLAME, and we add refinements to previous modelling of the triple and other populations and the model-fitting. We fit histograms of observed vs Newtonian velocity differences to a flexible mixture of binary + triple populations with realistic eccentricity distributions, plus unbound flyby and random-chance populations. We find as before that Newtonian models provide a significantly better fit than MOND, though improved understanding of the triple population is necessary to make this fully decisive.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature and fate of the almost-dark cloud AGC 226178 through HI mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of extragalactic, almost dark HI clouds with extreme gas-to-stellar mass ratios remains poorly understood. We investigate the nature and fate of the "almost dark" cloud AGC 226178, projected within the Virgo cluster, with an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of ~1000. We present deep single-dish HI mapping from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), complemented by high-resolution interferometric data from the Very Large Array (VLA), as part of the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. These observations provide the highest-quality HI analysis to date of such a cloud, combining resolution and sensitivity. FAST data reveal a short, low-velocity tail toward the dwarf galaxy VCC 2034, previously proposed as a possible origin for AGC 226178. However, VCC 2034 shows a line-of-sight asymmetric HI feature and cometary morphology indicating a stripping event unrelated to AGC 226178. VLA data reveal a velocity gradient across AGC 226178 and a clumpy internal structure. The velocity dispersion exceeds the thermal linewidth, implying turbulence or unresolved motions. The cloud cannot be gravitationally bound by atomic gas alone. The resolved HI clumps follow standard HI mass-star formation rate and mass-size relations, with those forming stars reaching surface densities above the threshold for self-shielding. We conclude that AGC 226178 is a free-floating HI cloud of unknown origin. The system appears to be in the process of disintegration. It is likely located well outside the Virgo cluster, as the preservation of its extended HI morphology within the cluster environment would otherwise require a substantial reservoir of unseen molecular gas with a mass exceeding that of the observed HI content. While confinement pressure from the hot intracluster medium may aid its stability, it is unlikely to be the dominant factor preventing its disruption.</description>

      <title>Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): From filaments to voids, how extreme environment affects gas metallicity and SFR in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06781</link>

Abstract: We analyse the stellar mass-metallicity (M-Z) and stellar mass-star formation rate (M-SFR) relations for star-forming galaxies classified by their environment and compare them with matched control samples of field galaxies. Using data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the filament catalogue, which categorises galaxies into filaments, tendrils, and voids, we correct emission lines for dust extinction and select star-forming galaxies based on the BPT diagram. Metallicity and star formation rate are estimated and used to fit the M-Z and M-SFR relations through both Bayesian and least-squares approaches. We find that metallicity increases in denser environments, while star formation rate decreases, with the most notable contrasts seen between filament/tendril galaxies and those in voids. Galaxies in filaments and tendrils that are not group members show little to no deviation from their control samples. Morphological analysis reveals no significant differences. Overall, galaxies in denser environments appear more chemically enriched with lower SFRs, likely due to processed material and reduced cold gas availability, while isolated void galaxies maintain higher SFRs and lower metallicities, possibly due to ongoing cold gas accretion. These results suggest that local environmental conditions, rather than large-scale structure alone, are the main drivers of the observed trends.</description>

      <title>A North-South Metallicity Asymmetry in the Outer Galactic disk -- Evidence for the Pericentric Passage of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present maps of the mean metallicity distributions on the Galactocentric $R$--$Z$ plane at different azimuthal angles using red clump stars selected from the LAMOST and APOGEE surveys. In the inner disk ($R &lt; $ 11\,kpc), the metallicity distribution is symmetric between the upper and lower disk. However, we find a North-South metallicity asymmetry in the outer disk ($R &gt; 11$\,kpc), especially towards the anti-Galactic center ($-5^\circ &lt; \Phi &lt; 15^\circ$) direction. By further dissecting the map in age space, we detect this asymmetry across all mono-age stellar populations. However, the asymmetry is less pronounced in older populations ($\tau &gt; 8$ Gyr) compared to younger ones ($\tau &lt; 6$\,Gyr). This reduced significance likely stems from three factors: larger age uncertainties, fewer stars in the outer disk, and the kinematically hotter nature of older populations. The observed metallicity asymmetry may be the consequence of the purturbation of the recent pericentric passage through the Galactic disk and tidal force of the well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>Matching seismic masses for RR Lyrae-type and oscillating red horizontal-branch stars in M4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters offer a powerful way to test the properties of stellar populations and the late stages of low-mass stellar evolution. In this paper we study oscillating giant stars and overtone RR Lyrae-type pulsators in the nearest globular cluster, M4, with the help of high-precision, continuous light curves collected by the Kepler space telescope in the K2 mission. We determine the frequency composition of five RRc stars and model their physical parameters from linear pulsation models. We are able, for the first time, to compare seismic masses of RR Lyrae stars directly to the masses of the very similar red horizontal branch stars in the same stellar population, independently determined from asteroseismic scaling relations. We find average seismic masses of $0.648\pm0.028\,M_\odot$ for RR Lyrae stars and $0.657\pm0.034\,M_\odot$ for red horizontal-branch stars. While the accuracy of our RR Lyrae masses still relies on the accuracy of evolutionary mass differences of neighboring horizontal branch subgroups, this result strongly indicates that RRc stars may indeed exhibit high-degree, $\ell = 8$ and 9 non-radial modes, and modeling these modes can provide realistic mass estimates. We compare the seismic masses of our red horizontal branch and RR Lyrae stars to evolutionary models and to theoretical mass relations and highlight the limitations of these relations.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmology with N-body simulations for future spectroscopic galaxy surveys at $2\leq z\leq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the spatial curvature ($\Omega_k$) independent of cosmic microwave background observations plays a key role in revealing the physics of the early universe. The Hubble tension is one of the most serious issues in modern cosmology. We investigate halo catalogs identified from $N$-body simulations at $z=2$ and 3, mimicking high-redshift galaxy surveys. We measure redshift-space correlation functions of halos from the two snapshots. We detect clear features of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions. We find that we can obtain a few percent constraints on both the geometric distances and growth of structure at the distant universe in future surveys. By taking into account the information of the underlying matter power spectrum, we demonstrate that we can also achieve constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ with a few percent as well as the spatial curvature with $|\Omega_k|\lesssim 0.1$ by observing galaxies with the number density with $\bar{n}_{\rm g}\simeq 10^{-4} (~h^3{\rm ~Mpc}^{-3})$. Our analysis provides a timely forecast for the upcoming spectroscopic surveys, which target emission line galaxy or dusty star-forming galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Turbulence: the Small-Scale Limit of the Cold-Dark-Matter Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, is one of the fundamental quantities in the study of large-scale structure in cosmology. Here, we study its small-scale asymptotic limit, and show that for cold dark matter in $d$ spatial dimensions, $P(k)$ has a universal $k^{-d}$ asymptotic scaling with the wave-number $k$, for $k \gg k_{\rm nl}$, where $k_{\rm nl}^{-1}$ denotes the length scale at which non-linearities in gravitational interactions become important. We propose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative analysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown to drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where the linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates the $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor turbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal interactions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a phase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is analysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this integral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness of the dark-matter distribution function - its non-vanishing only on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space - underpins both approaches. The theory is accompanied by $1\mathrm{D}$ Vlasov-Poisson simulations, which confirm it.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger detection of black hole binaries in dark matter spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inspiral of a high mass-ratio black hole binary located in the nucleus of a galaxy, where the primary central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter spike formed through accretion during the black hole growth phase. Within this spike, dark matter undergoes strong self-annihilation, producing a compact source of $\gamma$-ray radiation that is highly sensitive to spike density, while the binary emits gravitational waves at frequencies detectable by LISA. As the inspiralling binary interacts with the surrounding dark matter particles, it alters the density of the spike, thereby influencing the $\gamma$-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. We demonstrate that the spike self-annihilation luminosity decreases by $10\%$ to $90\%$ of its initial value, depending on the initial density profile and binary mass ratio, as the binary sweeps through the LISA band. This presents a new opportunity to indirectly probe dark matter through multi-messenger observations of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Estimating Bolometric Luminosities of Type 1 Quasars with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured, type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}. Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have also made our code publicly available.</description>
