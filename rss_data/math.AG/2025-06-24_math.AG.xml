      <title>Extensions of Abelian Schemes and the Additive Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute extension sheaves of abelian schemes and of the additive group by the multiplicative group in the fppf topology. Our main results include a generalized and streamlined proof of the Barsotti--Weil formula, the vanishing of $\underline{\operatorname{Ext}}^2(A,\mathbb{G}_m)$ for an abelian scheme $A$ over a general base, and a description of $\underline{\operatorname{Ext}}^1(\mathbb{G}_a,\mathbb{G}_m)$ in characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>On the volume of K-semistable Fano manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the volume of an $n$-dimensional K-semistable Fano manifold that is not $\mathbb{P}^n$ is at most $2n^n$. Moreover, the equality holds only if $X\cong \mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ or $X$ is a smooth quadric hypersurface $Q\subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1}$. Our proof is based on a new connection between K-semistability and minimal rational curves. More generally, we show that the volume of a K-semistable Fano manifold with a minimal rational curve of degree $d$ is bounded above by the volume of $\mathbb{P}^{d-1}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-d+1}$.</description>

      <title>Stratified Hyperbolicity of the moduli stack of stable minimal models, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a birationally admissible stratification on the Deligne-Mumford stack of stable minimal models (e.g., the KSBA moduli stack), such that the universal family over each stratum admits a simple normal crossing log birational model. We further demonstrate that each stratum is hyperbolic in the sense that every schematic generically finite covering of any closed substack is of logarithmic general type. This provides a partial answer to C.Birkar's question regarding the global geometry of the moduli of stable minimal models.</description>

      <title>Conformal blocks, parahoric torsors and Borel-Weil-Bott</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field $k$. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a parahoric group scheme on $X$ as in \cite{pr}. Via the principle of Hecke correspondences, we set-up relationships between the cohomology of lines bundles on various moduli stacks of torsors. This approach gives a proof of \cite[Conjecture 3.7]{pr} for group schemes $\mathcal G$ as above in characteristic zero. This further gives as a consequence, the principle of propagation of vacua. We give a direct proof of the independence of central charge on base points. Projective flatness is recovered as a corollary of Faltings construction of the Hitchin connection. Using C.Teleman's basic results (\cite{bwb}), we deduce the analogous result that cohomology of line bundles on the stack of principal $G$-bundles vanish in all degrees except possibly one. Results on twisted vacua \cite{hongkumar} are obtained as immediate consequences.</description>

      <title>On a theorem of Narasimhan and Ramanan on deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve genus at least $3$, over an algebraically closed field $k$ of arbitrary characteristics. Let $\cM$ denote the moduli stack $\cM_X(\cH)$ of $\cH$-torsors on $X$, when $\cH$ {\em quasi-split absolutely simple, simply connected connected group scheme}. Using the theory of parahoric torsors and Hecke correspondences, we describe the cohomology groups $\text{H}^i(\cM, \cT_{_{\cM}}), i = 0,1,2$ and $\text{H}^i(\cM, \Omega_{_{\cM}}), i = 0,1,2$ in terms of the curve $X$. The classical results of Narasimhan and Ramanan are derived as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Positivity of coinvariant divisors on $\overline{\mathrm{M}}_{0,n}$ and the parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give criteria for determining the positivity of line bundles coming from vertex operator algebras (VOAs) on the moduli space $\overline{\mathrm{M}}_{0,n}$ of rational curves with $n$ marked points. The criteria use the multiplicative structure of VOA representations encoded in the fusion ring. Using them, we construct positive line bundles on $\overline{\mathrm{M}}_{0,n}$ from certain parafermion VOAs. These give the first examples of commutant VOAs producing positive line bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the positivity properties of the projectivization of a parabolic bundle over a smooth complex projective curve. The generators of its N\'eron--Severi group are computed, and the positive cone is determined. In particular, we compute explicitly the generators for the higher nef cones and the pseudoeffective cones. As an application, we deduce a necessary and sufficient condition for the semistability of a parabolic bundle.</description>

      <title>A conjectural generalization of the Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecturally generalize the Conjecture by Brian\c{c}on and Iarrobino on the most singular points of the Hilbert scheme of a tetrahedral number of points in $\BA^3$ by introducing the notion of \textit{locally-maximal singularity}. The formulation of this conjecture is based on the shape of the ideals via a picturesque pattern. It also generalizes the conjectural necessary condition for the most singular points, suggested by the second-named author in \cite{Rezaee-23-Conjectures}, restricted to a tetrahedral number of points in 3D. These conjectures and those in the prequel work aim to prove the original conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds via Exceptional Group Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete proof of the (1,1)-type Hodge conjecture for a special class of 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds ($h^{1,1}=56$), while establishing and implementing a novel methodology based on exceptional group constraints. The core idea of this methodology is to replace the "geometric construction" that traditional methods rely on -- which becomes infeasible in high-dimensional cases -- with the "algebraic rigidity" of Lie algebra representation theory. We prove that by introducing the symmetry of the $E_7$ group, we can generate a "dimension tension" in the Spencer cohomology framework we developed, which forcibly makes the dimension of the Spencer kernel precisely match the Hodge numbers of the manifold, thereby bypassing concrete algebraic geometric calculations. This dimension matching result is a key step in satisfying the "Spencer-Hodge verification criterion" we previously established. Its completion not only solves a non-trivial special case of the Hodge conjecture, but more importantly, provides the first strong evidence for this new paradigm of connecting representation theory with Hodge theory to solve core problems in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Moment-like maps and real algebraic functions with prescribed preimages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a problem on singularity theory of differentiable (smooth) or real algebraic maps which is different from knowing existence and has been difficult: constructing explcit real algebraic functions.
  We discuss construction of real algebraic functions with exactly one singular value, the singular points being of definite type, and prescribed preimages of single points. We discuss generalizations of the canonical projection of the unit sphere around the pole and the Morse-Bott functions around the boundaries of the images with preimages diffeomorphic to the torus.
  This has been discussed in the differentiable (smooth) category since the pioneering study of Sharko in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki, Michalak and so on: the author has first considered the cases respecting the topologies of the preimages of the points where these studies had not done this essentially. Related real algebraic studies have been started by the author essentially in 2020's and the studies are developing, mainly due to the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Gromov--Witten invariants allow one to obtain an arithmetically meaningful count of curves satisfying constraints over a field $k$ without assuming that $k$ is the field of complex or real numbers. This paper studies the behavior of quadratic genus $0$ Gromov--Witten invariants during an algebraic analogue of surgery on del Pezzo surfaces. For this, we define and study (twisted) binomial coefficients in the Grothendieck--Witt group, building on work of Serre. We obtain a formula expressing the quadratic genus $0$ Gromov--Witten invariants of surfaces obtained as a smoothing of a given nodal surface in terms of those of the one having the largest Picard group. We give applications to quadratic Gromov--Witten invariants of rational del Pezzo surfaces of degree at least 7, some cubic surfaces, for point constraints defined over quadratic extensions of $k$, as well as an invariance result under a Dehn twist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use explicit blow-ups and computations of birational Fujita-Zariski decompositions to determine generic infinitesimal Newton-Okounkov bodies for box-product ample polarizations on three classes of spaces: product between a curve and the projective plane, products of three curves, and the product between a curve and a Jacobian surface. In particular we compute the volume of many big but non-nef divisors on blow-ups of these threefolds.</description>

      <title>Generalized Mittag-Leffler functions, Borel-Laplace multitransforms, and quantum differential equations of Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the integration problem for the isomonodromic system of quantum differential equations associated with smooth projective Fano varieties. We begin by introducing a class of multivariable, multivalued analytic functions of Mittag-Leffler type. We study their analytic properties and provide explicit Mellin-Barnes integral representations. For any smooth Fano toric variety, we prove that suitable integral linear combinations of these generalized Mittag-Leffler functions and their derivatives form bases of solutions for the corresponding quantum differential equation. In the second part of the paper, we introduce two families of integral transforms -- referred to as Borel-Laplace multitransforms -- acting on tuples of functions. We show that the Laplace multitransform enables the reconstruction of the full solution space of the quantum differential equations for Fano complete intersections, starting from a basis of solutions associated with the ambient Fano variety. Dually, the Borel multitransform reconstructs the solution space for the quantum differential equations of Fano projective bundles of arbitrary rank from that of the base variety. These results both systematize and generalize the research directions initiated in arXiv:2005.08262 and arXiv:2210.05445. Applications include explicit examples involving Fano toric complete intersections, Fano bundles on toric varieties, and low-dimensional Fano varieties such as strict del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

      <title>Moduli Theory of the $r$-Braid Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a family of hyperplane arrangements depending on a positive integer parameter $r$, which we refer to as the $r$-braid arrangements, and which can be viewed as a generalization of the classical braid arrangement. The wonderful compactification of the braid arrangement (with respect to its minimal building set) is well-known to yield the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$, and, in this work, we generalize this result, constructing a moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}^r_{n}$ of certain genus-zero curves with an order-$r$ involution that we identify with the corresponding wonderful compactification of the $r$-braid arrangement. The resulting space is a variant of the previously studied moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{L}}^r_n$ [arXiv:2104.06526], related via a change of weights on the markings.</description>

      <title>The spaces of rational curves on del Pezzo surfaces via conic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the homological sieve method developed by Das--Lehmann--Tosteson and the author, we prove Peyre's all height approach to Manin's conjecture for split quintic del Pezzo surfaces defined over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ assuming $q$ is sufficiently large. We also establish lower bounds of correct magnitude for the counting function of rational curves on split low degree del Pezzo surfaces defined over $\mathbb F_q$ assuming $q$ is large.</description>

      <title>A converse to Cartan's Theorem B: The extension property for real analytic and Nash sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1957 Cartan proved his celebrated Theorem B and deduced that if $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ is an open set and $X$ is a coherent real analytic subset of $\Omega$, then $X$ has the analytic extension property, that is, each real analytic function on $X$ extends to a real analytic function on $\Omega$. The converse implication in its full generality remains unproven. In the literature only special cases of non-coherent real analytic sets $X\subset\Omega$ without the extension property appear, some of them due to Cartan himself: mainly real analytic sets $X\subset\Omega$ that have a visible `tail'.
  We prove the converse implication: If a subset $X$ of $\Omega$ has the analytic extension property, it is a coherent real analytic subset of $\Omega$. The class of sets with the analytic extension property coincides with that of coherent real analytic sets.
  We extend the previous characterization to the Nash case, which is somehow more demanding, because of its finiteness properties and its disappointing behavior with respect to cohomology of sheaves of Nash function germs. Let $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ be an open semialgebraic set and let $X\subset\Omega$ be a set. We prove that each Nash function on $X$ extends to a Nash function on $\Omega$ if and only if $X\subset\Omega$ is a coherent Nash set. The `if' implication goes back to some celebrated results of Coste, Ruiz and Shiota.
  If $M\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ is a Nash manifold, ${\mathcal C}^\infty$ semialgebraic functions on $M$ coincide with Nash functions on $M$. As an application, we confront the coherence of a Nash set $X\subset\Omega$ with the fact that each ${\mathcal C}^\infty$ semialgebraic function on $X$ is a Nash function on $X$. We provide a full characterization of the semialgebraic sets $S\subset\Omega$ for which ${\mathcal C}^\infty$ semialgebraic functions on $S$ coincide with Nash functions on $S$.</description>

      <title>An anticanonical perspective on G/P Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a natural basis of the Cartier class group of an arbitrary Schubert variety $X_{w,P}$ in a flag variety $G/P$ of general Lie type. We then characterise when the Schubert variety is factorial/Fano, along with an explicit formula for the anticanonical line bundle in these cases. We also prove that, for Schubert varieties in simply-laced types (only), being factorial is equivalent to being $Q$-factorial, and is equivalent to the equality of the Betti numbers $b_2(X_{w,P})=b_{2\ell(w)-2}(X_{w,P})$. Finally, we give a convenient characterisation of when a simply-laced Schubert variety is Gorenstein and when it is Gorenstein Fano.</description>

      <title>Severi varieties on Enriques surfaces of base change type and on rational elliptic surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If an irreducible curve on the very general Enriques surface splits in the K3 cover, its preimage consists of two linearly equivalent irreducible curves. We prove the nonemptiness of countable families of Severi varieties of curves of any genus on Enriques surfaces of base change type, whose members split in nonlinearly equivalent curves in the K3 cover. Our machinery leads us to provide examples of special superabundant logarithmic Severi varieties of curves of any genus on rational elliptic surfaces.</description>

Abstract: This work studies $t$-structures for the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a Noetherian algebraic stack. Specifically, using Thomason filtrations, we classify those $t$-structures which are generated by perfect complexes and satisfy a tensor compatibility. Consequently, we strengthen a result of Dubey--Sahoo to the setting of algebraic stacks.</description>

      <title>Contact loci of semihomogeneous singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two of the main open problems in the theory of contact loci are the arc-Floer conjecture, which states that the compactly supported cohomology of the restricted $m$-contact locus and the fixed-point Floer cohomology of the $m$-th iterate of the Milnor monodromy are isomorphic up to a shift; and the embedded Nash problem, which asks for a description of the irreducible components of the unrestricted $m$-contact locus in terms of an embedded resolution of singularities. In this paper we study the geometry of contact loci of semihomogeneous singularities, and use our results to give an affirmative answer to the arc-Floer conjecture (under some conditions on the dimension and the degree) and a complete solution to the embedded Nash problem.</description>

      <title>Signal Recovery on Algebraic Varieties Using Linear Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recovery of an unknown signal from its linear measurements is a fundamental problem spanning numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. Commonly, prior knowledge suggests that the underlying signal resides within a known algebraic variety. This context naturally leads to a question: what is the minimum number of measurements required to uniquely recover any signal belonging to such an algebraic variety? In this survey paper, we introduce a method that leverages tools from algebraic geometry to address this question. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to two problems: phase retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery. %Furthermore, this paper bridges abstract algebraic concepts with concrete signal processing. We also highlight several open problems, which could serve as a basis for future investigations in this field.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of associated primes for local cohomology modules of excellent locally unramified regular rings of finite Krull dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thirty years ago, Huneke (for local rings) and Lyubeznik (in general) conjectured that for all regular rings $R$, the local cohomology modules $H^i_I(R)$ have finitely many associated prime ideals. We prove substantial new cases of their conjecture by proving that the local cohomology modules $H^i_I(R)$ have finitely many associated prime ideals whenever $R$ is an excellent regular ring of finite Krull dimension such that $R/pR$ is regular and $F$-finite for every prime number $p$. Our result is new even for excellent regular $\mathbf{Q}$-algebras of finite Krull dimension, for example for finitely generated rings over formal power series rings over fields of characteristic zero. Our proof uses perverse sheaves, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for smooth complex varieties, N\'eron-Popescu desingularization, and a delicate Noetherian approximation argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by intuitions from projective algebraic geometry, we provide a novel construction of subsets of the $d$-dimensional grid $[n]^d$ of size $n - o(n)$ with no $d + 2$ points on a sphere or a hyperplane. For $d = 2$, this improves the previously best known lower bound of $n/4$ toward the Erd\H{o}s--Purdy problem due to Thiele in 1995. For $d \ge 3$, this improves the recent $\Omega \bigl( n^{\frac{3}{d+1}-o(1)} \bigr)$ bound due to Suk and White, confirming their conjectured $\Omega \bigl( n^{\frac{d}{d+1}} \bigr)$ bound in a strong sense, and asymptotically resolves the generalized Erd\H{o}s--Purdy problem posed by Brass, Moser, and Pach.</description>

      <title>Exotic hypercomplex structures on a torus do not exist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hypercomplex manifold is a manifold with three complex structures satisfying quaternionic relations. Such a manifold admits a unique torsion-free connection preserving the quaternionic action, called the Obata connection. A compact Kahler manifold admitting a hypercomplex structure always admits a hyperkahler structure as well; however, it is not obvious whether the original hypercomplex structure is hyperkahler. A non-hyperkahler hypercomplex structure on a Kahler manifold is called exotic. We show that the Obata connection for an exotic hypercomplex structure on a torus is flat and classify complete flat affine structures on real tori. We use this classification to prove that exotic hypercomplex structures do not exist.</description>

      <title>New evidence for R\'emond's generalisation of Lehmer's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we generalise a result of Pottmeyer from the multiplicative group of the algebraic numbers to almost split semiabelian varieties defined over number fields. This concerns a consequence of R\'emond's generalisation of Lehmer's conjecture. Namely, for a finite rank subgroup $\Gamma$ of an almost split semiabelian variety $G$, we consider the group of rational points of $G$ over a finite extension of the field generated by the saturated closure of $\Gamma$, i.e. the division closure of the subgroup generated by $\Gamma$ and all its images under geometric endomorphisms of $G$. We show that this becomes a free group after one quotients out the saturated closure of $\Gamma$. The proof uses, amongst other ingredients, a criterion of Pottmeyer, which relies on a result of Pontryagin, together with a result from Kummer theory, of which we reproduce a proof by R\'emond.</description>

      <title>Counting elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded naive height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give exact and asymptotic formulas for counting elliptic curves $ E_{A,B} \colon y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B $ with $ A, B \in \mathbb{Z} $, ordered by naive height. We study the family of all such curves and also several natural subfamilies, including those with fixed $ j $-invariant and those with complex multiplication (CM). In particular, we provide formulas for two commonly used normalizations of the naive height appearing in the literature: the calibrated naive height, defined by \[ H^{\mathrm{cal}}(E_{A,B}) := \max\{ 4|A|^3, 27B^2 \}, \] and the uncalibrated naive height, defined by \[ H^{\mathrm{ncal}}(E_{A,B}) := \max\{ |A|^3, B^2 \}. \] In fact, we prove our theorems with respect to the more general naive height $H_{\alpha, \beta}(E_{A,B}) := \max\{ \alpha |A|^3, \beta B^2 \}$, defined for arbitrary positive real numbers $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0}$.
  As part of our approach, we give a completely explicit parametrization of the set of curves $ E_{A,B} $ with fixed $ j $-invariant and bounded naive height, describing them as twists of the curve $ E_{A_j, B_j} $ of minimal naive height for the given $ j $-invariant. We also include tables comparing and verifying our theoretical predictions with exact counts obtained via exhaustive computer searches, and we compute data for CM elliptic curves of naive height up to $ 10^{30} $. Code in SageMath is provided to compute all exact and asymptotic formulas appearing in the paper.</description>

Abstract: We classify finite groups that act faithfully by symplectic birational transformations on an irreducible holomorphic symplectic (IHS) manifold of OG10 type. In particular, if X is an IHS manifold of OG10 type and G a finite subgroup of symplectic birational transformations of X, then the action of G on H2(X, Z) is conjugate to a subgroup of one of 375 groups of isometries. We prove a criterion for when such a group is determined by a group of automorphisms acting on a cubic fourfold, and apply it to our classification. Our proof is computer aided and our results are available in a Zenodo dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the isotopy type of a hypersurface, defined as the positive real zero set of a multivariate polynomial, is a challenging problem in real algebraic geometry. We focus on the case where the defining polynomial has combinatorially restricted exponent vectors and fixed coefficient signs, enabling faster computation of the isotopy type. In particular, Viro's patchworking provides a polyhedral complex that has the same isotopy type as the hypersurface, for certain choices of the coefficients. So we present properties of the signed support, focussing mainly on the case of n-variate (n+3)-nomials, that ensure all possible isotopy types can be obtained via patchworking. To prove this, we study the signed reduced A-discriminant and show that it has a simple structure if the signed support satisfies some combinatorial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study integral plane curves meeting at a single unibranch point and show that such curves must satisfy two equivalent conditions. A numeric condition: the local invariants of the curves at the contact point must be arithmetically related. A geometric condition: the tropical curves that we associate to the contact point must be isomorphic. Moreover, we prove closed formulas for the delta-invariant of a unibranch singularity, and for the dimension of the loci of curves with an assigned unibranch point. Our work is motivated by interest in the Lang exceptional set.</description>

Abstract: We define a Hodge-theoretical refinement of the Lyubeznik numbers for local rings of complex algebraic varieties. We prove that these numbers are independent of the choices made in their definition and that, for the local ring of an isolated singularity, they can be expressed in terms of the Hodge numbers of the cohomology of the link of the singularity.

      <title>Modularity of $d$-elliptic loci with level structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generating series of special cycles on $\mathcal{A}_1(N)\times \mathcal{A}_g(N)$, with full level $N$ structure, valued in the cohomology of degree $2g$. The modularity theorem of Kudla-Millson for locally symmetric spaces implies that these series are modular. When $N=1$, the images of these loci in $\mathcal{A}_g$ are the $d$-elliptic Noether-Lefschetz loci, which are conjectured to be modular. In the appendix, it is shown that the resulting modular forms are nonzero for $g=2$ when $N\geq 11$ and $N\neq 12$.</description>

      <title>The Synthetic Hilbert Additive Group Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a lift of the degree filtration on the integer valued polynomials to (even MU-based) synthetic spectra. Namely, we construct a bialgebra in modules over the evenly filtered sphere spectrum which base-changes to the degree filtration on the integer valued polynomials. As a consequence, we may lift the Hilbert additive group scheme to a spectral group scheme over $\mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{G}_m$. We study the cohomology of its deloopings, and show that one obtains a lift of the filtered circle, studied in [MRT22]. At the level of quasi-coherent sheaves, one obtains lifts synthetic lifts of the $\mathbb{Z}$-linear $\infty$-categories of $S^1_{\mathrm{fil}}$-representations. Our constructions crucially rely on the use of the even filtration of Hahn--Raksit--Wilson; it is linearity with respect to the even filtered sphere that powers the results of this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of fields/distributions developed the paper "A Feigin-Frenkel theorem with n singularities" to a general base scheme. In order to do so we introduce suitable notions of topological sheaves on schemes and study their basic properties. We then construct appropriate analogues of the spaces of fields, consider multiplication of fields between them and rebuild the basic theory of vertex algebras in the setting of global distributions in place of formal power series, which takes the form of chiral algebras introduced Beilinson and Drinfeld in "Chiral Algebras".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that a natural twisted derived category of any hyper-K\"ahler variety of $K3^{[n]}$-type is controlled by its Markman-Mukai lattice. We prove the conjecture under numerical constraints, and our proof relies heavily on Markman's projectively hyperholomorphic bundle and a recently proven twisted version of the D-equivalence conjecture.
  In particular, we prove that any two fine moduli spaces of stable sheaves on a $K3$ surface are derived equivalent if they have the same dimension.</description>

Abstract: We prove new bounds for the period-index problem for hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type using projectively hyperholomorphic bundles constructed by Markman. We show that $\mathrm{dim}(X)$ is a bound for any $X$ of $K3^{[n]}$-type. We also show that $\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{dim}(X)$ is a bound for most Brauer classes when the Picard rank of $X$ is at least two, providing evidence for a conjecture of Huybrechts.</description>

Abstract: M. Kontsevich conjectured and T. Bitoun proved that if M is a nonzero holonomic D-module then the p-support of a generic reduction of M to characteristic p&gt;0 is Lagrangian. We provide a new elementary proof of this theorem and also generalize it to q-D-modules. The proofs are based on Bernstein's theorem that any holonomic D-module can be transformed by an element of the symplectic group into a vector bundle with a flat connection, and a q-analog of this theorem. We also discuss potential applications to quantizations of symplectic singularities and to quantum cluster algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work begins by studying the vanishing of higher cohomology for the derived pushforward of a torsion free sheaf along a modification of integral Noetherian schemes. Leveraging this, we establish a relatively simple recipe for constructing varieties with (mild) rational or Du Bois singularities, some of which is applicable in both zero and nonzero characteristic. Furthermore, we explore notions of singularities that lie in the same cohomological veins of rational singularities for varieties in characteristic zero, including Bhatt's derived splinters and Kov\'{a}cs' birational derived splinters.</description>

Abstract: A desmic quartic surface is a birational model of the Kummer surface of the self-product of an elliptic curve. We recall the classical geometry of these surfaces and study their analogs in arbitrary characteristic. Moreover, we discuss the cubic line complex $\frakG$ associated with the desmic tetrahedra introduced by G. Humbert. We prove that $\frakG$ is a rational $\bbQ$-Fano threefold with 34 nodes and the group of projective automorphisms isomorphic to $(\frakS_4\times \frakS_4)\rtimes 2$.</description>

      <title>Three results on holonomic D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this text, we illustrate the use of local methods in the theory of (irregular) holonomic D-modules. I. (The Euler characteristic of the de~Rham complex) We show the invariance of the global or local Euler characteristic of the de~Rham complex after localization and dual localization of a holonomic D-module along a hypersurface, as well as after tensoring with a rank one meromorphic connection with regular singularities. II. (Local generic vanishing theorems for holonomic D-modules) We prove that the natural morphism from the proper pushforward to the total pushforward of an algebraic holonomic D-module by an open inclusion is an isomorphism if we first twist the D-module structure by suitable closed algebraic differential forms. III. (Laplace transform of a Stokes-filtered constructible sheaf of exponential type) Motivated by the construction in [YZ24], we~propose a slightly different construction of the Laplace transform of a Stokes-perverse sheaf on the projective line and show directly that it corresponds to the Laplace transform of the corresponding holonomic D-module via the Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff-Deligne-Malgrange correspondence. This completes the presentation given in [Sab13, Chap. 7]}, where only the other direction of the Laplace transformation is analyzed. We~also compare our approach with the construction made previously in [YZ24].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A causal manifold $(M,\gamma)$ is a manifold $M$ endowed with a closed proper cone $\gamma$ in the tangent bundle $TM$ such that the projection $TM\to M$ is surjective when restricted to the interior of $\gamma$. Let $\lambda$ be the antipodal of the polar cone of $\gamma$.
  An open set $U$ of $M$ is called $\gamma$-open if its Whitney normal cone contains the interior of $\gamma$. Similarly, $U$ is called $\lambda$-open if the micro-support of the constant sheaf on $U$ is contained in $\lambda$. We begin by proving that the two notions coincide.
  Next, we prove that if $(M,\gamma)$ admits a ``future time function'' the functor of direct images establishes an equivalence of triangulated categories between the derived category of sheaves on $M$ micro-supported by $\lambda$ and the derived category of sheaves on the manifold $M$ endowed with the $\gamma$-topology. This generalizes a result of~\cite{KS90} which dealt with the case of a constant cone in a vector space.</description>

Abstract: We study K3 surfaces of degree 6 containing two sets of 12 skew lines such that each line from a set intersects exactly six lines from the other set. These surfaces arise as hyperplane sections of the cubic line complex associated with the pencil of desmic quartic surfaces introduced by George Humbert and recently studied by the second and third authors. We discuss alternative birational models of the surfaces, compute the Picard lattice and a group of projective automorphisms, and describe rational curves of low degree on the general surface.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel approach to the Brill-Noether theory of curves endowed with a degree k cover of the projective line via Bridgeland stability conditions on elliptic K3 surfaces. We first develop the Brill-Noether theory on elliptic K3 surfaces via the notion of Bridgeland stability type for objects in their derived category. As a main application, we show that curves on elliptic K3 surfaces serve as the first known examples of smooth k-gonal curves which are general from the viewpoint of Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory. In particular, we provide new proofs of the main non-existence and existence results in Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory. Finally, using degree-k Halphen surfaces, we construct explicit examples of curves defined over number fields which are general from the perspective of Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory.</description>

Abstract: The genus 0, fixed-domain log Gromov-Witten invariants of a smooth, projective toric variety X enumerate maps from a general pointed rational curve to a smooth, projective toric variety passing through the maximal number of general points and with prescribed multiplicities along the toric boundary. We determine these invariants completely for the projective bundle X=P_{P^r}(O^s+O(-a)), proving a conjecture of Cela--Iribar L\'opez. A different conjecture when X is the blow-up of P^r at r points is disproven. Whereas the conjectures were predicted using tropical methods, we give direct intersection-theoretic calculations on moduli spaces of "naive log quasimaps."</description>

Abstract: An isogeny class $\mathcal{A}$ of abelian varieties defined over finite fields is said to be "cyclic" if every variety in $\mathcal{A}$ has a cyclic group of rational points. In this paper we study the local cyclicity of Weil-central isogeny classes of abelian varieties, i.e. those with Weil polynomials of the form $f_\mathcal{A}(t)=t^{2g}+at^g+q^g$, as well as the local growth of the groups of rational points of the varieties in $\mathcal{A}$ after finite field extensions. We exploit the criterion: an isogeny class $\mathcal{A}$ with Weil polynomial $f$ is cyclic if and only if $f'(1)$ is coprime with $f(1)$ divided by its radical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12741v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new algebraic description of Ikeda-Naruse's $K$-theoretic Schur $P$- and $Q$-functions and their dual functions in terms of neutral fermion operators. We introduce four families of ``$\beta$-deformed neutral-fermion operators'' depending on a parameter $\beta$, which reduce to the usual neutral-fermion operators when $\beta$ is zero. Using these operators, we introduce two families of $\beta$-deformed vertex operators, power sums, and boson-fermion correspondences. From commutation relations among these operators, we naturally derive the $K$-theoretic Cauchy kernel of Nakagawa-Naruse. Exploiting this fact, we show that the four $K$-theoretic functions can be realized as vacuum expectation values of certain $\beta$-deformed fermionic operators. This presentation also allows us to derive generating functions for the dual $K$-theoretic $P$-and $Q$-functions, as conjectured by Nakagawa-Naruse.</description>

      <title>KP integrability of non-perturbative differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the KP integrability of non-perturbative topological recursion, which can be considered as a formal $\hbar$-deformation of the Krichever construction of algebro-geometric solutions of the KP hierarchy. This property goes back to a 2011 conjecture of Borot and Eynard.</description>

      <title>Tropical cycles of discrete admissible covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article applies the technical framework developed in previous work by the author to discrete admissible covers and their moduli spaces. More precisely, we construct a poic-space that parameterizes the discrete admissible covers after fixing the genus of the target, the number of marked legs, and prescribing the ramification profiles above these marked legs. We then construct a linear poic-fibration over this poic-space and show that the usual weight assignment of covers produces an equivariant cycle of this poic-fibration. This poic-fibration comes naturally with source and target maps, and after taking the weak pushforward in top dimension through the source map and subsequently forgetting the marking, this gives rise to an equivariant tropical cycle of the corresponding spanning tree fibration. Through this framework we obtain a generalization of previously known results on these cycles pertaining to the gonality of tropical curves. Special cases of these tropical cycles yield the following result: \emph{A generic genus-$g$ $r$-marked tropical curve $\Gamma$ (with $g+r$ even) has $C_{\frac{g+r}{2}}$ many $r$-marked discrete admissible covers of degree $\frac{g+r}{2}+1$ of a tree (counted with multiplicity) that have a tropical modification of $\Gamma$ as a source, where $C_{\frac{g+r}{2}}$ is the $(\frac{g+r}{2})$th Catalan number}.</description>

      <title>Curvature, macroscopic dimensions, and symmetric products of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of toric coherent-constructible correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A morphism from a diagonalizable group $G$ to the torus of a toric variety $X$ induces an action of $G$ on $X$. We prove the category of ind-coherent sheaves on the quotient stack is equivalent to the category of sheaves on a cover of a real torus with singular supports contained in the FLTZ skeleton, extending Kuwagaki's nonequivariant coherent-constructible correspondence arXiv:1610.03214. We also investigate the functoriality of such correspondence for toric morphisms and inclusions of orbit closures.</description>

      <title>Equations defining Jacobians with Real Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $C:y^2=x(x-1)(x-a_1)(x-a_2)(x-a_3)$ is genus $2$ curve a natural question to ask is: Under what conditions on $a_1,a_2,a_3$ does the Jacobian $J(C)$ have real multiplication by $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{\Delta}]$ for some $\Delta&gt;0$. Over a hundred years ago Humbert gave an answer to this question for $\Delta=5$ and $\Delta=8$. In this paper we use work of Birkenhake and Wilhelm along with some classical results in enumerative geometry to generalize this to all discriminants, in principle. We also work it out explicitly in a few more cases.</description>
