      <title>Concentrated N-dimensional AMM with Polar Coordinates in Rust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand on the recent development of n-dimensional automated market makers for stablecoins by showing a way to build concentrated liquidity positions with ticks in polar coordinates in Rust, including the featured ability to skew said concentrated liquidity. We highlight the risk of stacking too many stablecoin pools and how to hedge said risk.</description>

      <title>A Microstructure Analysis of Coupling in CFMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The programmable and composable nature of smart contract protocols has enabled the emergence of novel market structures and asset classes that are architecturally frictional to implement in traditional financial paradigms. This fluidity has produced an understudied class of market dynamics, particularly in coupled markets where one market serves as an oracle for the other. In such market structures, purchases or liquidations through the intermediate asset create coupled price action between the intermediate and final assets; leading to basket inflation or deflation when denominated in the riskless asset. This paper examines the microstructure of this inflationary dynamic given two constant function market makers (CFMMs) as the intermediate market structures; attempting to quantify their contributions to the former relative to familiar pool metrics such as price drift, trade size, and market depth. Further, a concrete case study is developed, where both markets are constant product markets. The intention is to shed light on the market design process within such coupled environments.</description>
