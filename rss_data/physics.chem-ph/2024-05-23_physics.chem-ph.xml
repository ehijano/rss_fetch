      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Non-Adiabatic Interband Transitions on a Semiconductor Surface Induced by Hydrogen Atom Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the recently observed mysterious non-adiabatic energy transfer for hyperthermal H atom scattering from a semiconductor surface, Ge(111)c(2*8), we present a mixed quantum-classical non-adiabatic molecular dynamics model based on time-dependent evolution of Kohn-Sham orbitals and a classical path approximation. Our results suggest that facile non-adiabatic transitions occur selectively at the rest atom site, featuring excitation of valance band electrons to the conduction band, but not at the adatom site. This drastic site specificity can be attributed to the changes of the local band structure upon energetic H collisions at different surface sites, leading to transient near-degeneracies and significant couplings between occupied and unoccupied orbitals at the rest atom, but not at the adatom. These insights shed valuable light on the collisional induced non-adiabatic dynamics at semiconductor surfaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized Einstein Relations between Absorption and Emission Spectra at Thermodynamic Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Einstein coefficient spectra and a detailed-balance derivation of generalized Einstein relations between them that is based on the connection between spontaneous and stimulated emission. If two broadened levels or bands overlap in energy, transitions between them need not be purely absorptive or emissive. Consequently, spontaneous emission can occur in both transition directions, and four Einstein coefficient spectra replace the three Einstein coefficients for a line. At equilibrium, the four different spectra obey five pairwise relationships and one lineshape generates all four. These relationships are independent of molecular quantum statistics and predict the Stokes' shift between forward and reverse transitions required by equilibrium with blackbody radiation. For Boltzmann statistics, the relative strengths of forward and reverse transitions depend on the formal chemical potential difference between the initial and final bands, which becomes the standard chemical potential difference for ideal solutes. The formal chemical potential of a band replaces both the energy and degeneracy of a quantum level. Like the energies of quantum levels, the formal chemical potentials of bands obey the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle. Each stimulated Einstein coefficient spectrum gives a frequency-dependent transition cross section. Transition cross sections obey causality and a detailed-balance condition with spontaneous emission, but do not directly obey generalized Einstein relations. Even with an energetic width much less than the photon energy, an absorptive forward transition with an energetic width much greater than the thermal energy can have such an extreme Stokes' shift that its reverse transition cross section becomes predominantly absorptive rather than emissive.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Energy Transport via Long Alkyl Chains: A New Initiation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an effort to increase the speed and efficiency of ballistic energy transport via oligomeric chains, we performed measurements of the transport in compounds featuring long alkyl chains of up to 37 methylene units. Compounds of the N3-(CH2)n-COOMe type (denoted as aznME) were synthesized with n = 5, 10, 15, 19, 28, 37 and studied using relaxation-assisted two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. The speed of the ballistic transport, initiated by the N3 tag excitation, increased ca. 3-fold for the longer chains (n = 19-37) compared to the shorter chains, from 14.7 {\AA}/ps to 48 {\AA}/ps, in line with an earlier prediction (Nawagamuwage et al. 2021, J. Phys. Chem. B, 125, 7546). Modeling, based on solving numerically the Liouville equation, was capable of reproducing the experimental data only if three wavepackets are included, involving CH2 twisting (Tw), wagging (W), and rocking (Ro) chain bands. The approaches for designing molecular systems featuring higher speed and efficiency of energy transport are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bifunctional Noble Metal-free Ternary Chalcogenide Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen has been identified as a clean, zero carbon, sustainable, and promising energy source for the future, and electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production is an emission-free, efficient energy conversion technology. A major limitation of this approach is the unavailability of efficient, abundant, inexpensive catalysts, which prompts the need for new catalytic materials. Here, we report the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of a novel transition metal-based ternary chalcogenide family, LaMS$_3$ (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Powder X-ray diffraction confirms the phase purity of these materials, while composition analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirms the presence of the stoichiometric ratio of elements in these compounds. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were used to study the chemical states on the surface and in bulk, respectively. These materials exhibit bifunctional catalytic activity towards the two half-reactions of the water-splitting process, with LaNiS$_3$ being the most active material for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The LaMS$_3$ compounds show long-term stability with negligible change in the overpotential at a constant current density of 10 mA cm$^{-2}$ over 18 hours of measurements. As compared to the corresponding ternary oxides, the LaMS$_3$ materials exhibit higher activity and significantly lower Tafel slopes. The ability to catalyze both half-reactions of water electrolysis makes these materials promising candidates for bifunctional catalysts and presents a new avenue to search for high-efficiency electrocatalysts for water splitting.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Role and Origin of S* in Orange Carotenoid Protein Photoconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is the water-soluble mediator of non-photochemical quenching in cyanobacteria, a crucial photoprotective mechanism in response to excess illumination. OCP converts from a globular, inactive state (OCPo) to an extended, active conformation (OCPr) under high-light conditions, resulting in a concomitant redshift in the absorption of the bound carotenoid. Here, OCP was trapped in either the active or inactive state by fixing each protein conformation in trehalose-sucrose glass. Glass-encapsulated OCPo did not convert under intense illumination and OCPr did not convert in darkness, allowing the optical properties of each conformation to be determined at room temperature. We measured pump wavelength-dependent transient absorption of OCPo in glass films and found that initial OCP photoproducts are still formed, despite the glass preventing completion of the photocycle. By comparison to the pump wavelength dependence of the OCPo to OCPr photoconversion yield in buffer, we show that the long-lived carotenoid singlet-like feature (S*) is associated with ground-state heterogeneity within OCPo, rather than triggering OCP photoconversion.</description>

      <title>Accelerated First-Principles Exploration of Structure and Reactivity in Graphene Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO) materials are widely studied, and yet their atomic-scale structures remain to be fully understood. Here we show that the chemical and configurational space of GO can be rapidly explored by advanced machine-learning methods, combining on-the-fly acceleration for first-principles molecular dynamics with message-passing neural-network potentials. The first step allows for the rapid sampling of chemical structures with very little prior knowledge required; the second step affords state-of-the-art accuracy and predictive power. We apply the method to the thermal reduction of GO, which we describe in a realistic (ten-nanometre scale) structural model. Our simulations are consistent with recent experimental findings and help to rationalise them in atomistic and mechanistic detail. More generally, our work provides a platform for routine, accurate, and predictive simulations of diverse carbonaceous materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of Brownian elastohydrodynamic forces acting on confined soft colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confined motions in complex environments are ubiquitous in microbiology. These situations invariably involve the intricate coupling between fluid flow, soft boundaries, surface forces and fluctuations. In the present study, such a coupling is investigated using a novel method combining holographic microscopy and advanced statistical inference. Specifically, the Brownian motion of softmicrometric oil droplets near rigid walls is quantitatively analyzed. All the key statistical observables are reconstructed with high precision, allowing for nanoscale resolution of local mobilities and femtonewton inference of conservative or non-conservative forces. Strikingly, the analysis reveals the existence of a novel, transient, but large, soft Brownian force. The latter might be of crucial importance for microbiological and nanophysical transport, target finding or chemical reactions in crowded environments, and hence the whole life machinery.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised data driven approaches to Raman imaging through a multimode optical fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a label-free, chemically specific optical technique which provides detailed information about the chemical composition and structure of the excited analyte. Because of this, there is growing research interest in miniaturizing Raman probes to reach deep regions of the body. Typically, such probes utilize multiple optical fibers to act as separate excitation/collection channels with optical filters attached to the distal facet to separate the collected signal from the background optical signal from the probe itself. Although these probes have achieved impressive diagnostic performance, their use is limited by the overall size of the probe, which is typically several hundred micrometers to millimeters. Here, we show how a wavefront shaping technique can be used to measure Raman images through a single, hair thin multimode fiber. The wavefront shaping technique transforms the tip of the fiber to a sub-cellular spatial resolution Raman microscope. The resultant Raman images were analyzed with a variety of state-of-the-art statistical techniques including PCA, t-SNE, UMAP and k-means clustering. Our data-driven approach enables us to create high quality Raman images of microclusters of pharmaceuticals through a standard silica multimode optical fiber.</description>

      <title>Active dynamics of charged macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of active coupling on the transport properties of homogeneously charged macromolecules in an infinitely dilute solution. An enzyme becomes actively bound to a segment of the macromolecule, exerting an electrostatic force on it. Eventually, thermal fluctuations cause it to become unbound, introducing active coupling into the system. We study the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and find a new scaling regime compared to the thermal counterpart in the presence of hydrodynamic and segment-segment electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the study of segment-segment equal-time correlation reveals the swelling of the macromolecule. Further, we derive the concentration equation of the macromolecule with active binding and study how the cooperative diffusivity of the macromolecules get modified by its environment, including the macromolecules itself. It turns out that these active fluctuations enhance the effective diffusivity of the macromolecules. The derived closed-form expression for diffusion constant is pertinent to the accurate interpretation of light scattering data in multi-component systems with binding-unbinding equilibria.</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid and significant advancements in deep learning for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, the challenge of learning robust molecular representations that effectively generalize in real-world scenarios to novel compounds remains an elusive and unresolved task. This study examines how atom-level pretraining with quantum mechanics (QM) data can mitigate violations of assumptions regarding the distributional similarity between training and test data and therefore improve performance and generalization in downstream tasks. In the public dataset Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), we show how pretraining on atom-level QM improves performance overall and makes the activation of the features distributes more Gaussian-like which results in a representation that is more robust to distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hidden state molecular representations are analyzed to compare the effects of molecule-level and atom-level pretraining on QM data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the radiationless decay spectrum of an O 1s double core hole in liquid water. Our experiments were carried out using liquid-jet electron spectroscopy from cylindrical microjets of normal and deuterated water. The signal of the double-core-hole spectral fingerprints (hypersatellites) of liquid water is clearly identified, with an intensity ratio to Auger decay of singly charged O 1s of 0.0014(5). We observe a significant isotope effect between liquid H$_2$O and D$_2$O. For theoretical modeling, the Auger electron spectrum of the central water molecule in a water pentamer was calculated using an electronic-structure toolkit combined with molecular-dynamics simulations to capture the influence of molecular rearrangement within the ultrashort lifetime of the double core hole. We obtained the static and dynamic Auger spectra for H$_2$O, (H$_2$O)$_5$, D$_2$O, and (D$_2$O)$_5$, instantaneous Auger spectra at selected times after core-level ionization, and the symmetrized oxygen-hydrogen distance as a function of time after double core ionization for all four prototypical systems. We consider this observation of liquid-water double core holes as a new tool to study ultrafast nuclear dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperpolarized nuclear spins in molecules exhibit high magnetization that is unachievable by classical polarization techniques, making them widely used as sensors in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The state of a hyperpolarized material, however, is typically only studied indirectly and with partial destruction of magnetization, due to the nature of conventional detection by resonant-pickup nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or imaging. Here we establish atomic magnetometers with sub-pT sensitivity as an use an alternative modality to detect in real time the complex dynamics of hyperpolarized materials without disturbing or interrupting the magnetogenesis process. As an example of dynamics that are impossible to detect in real time by conventional means, we examine parahydrogen-induced $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C magnetization during adiabatic eigenbasis transformations at \si{\micro\tesla}-field avoided crossings. Continuous but nondestructive magnetometry reveals previously unseen spin dynamics, fidelity limits, and magnetization back-action effects. As a second example, we apply magnetometry to observe the chemical-exchange-driven $^{13}$C hyperpolarization of [1--$^{13}$C]-pyruvate -- the most important spin tracer for clinical metabolic imaging. Our approach can be readily combined with other high-sensitivity magnetometers and is applicable to a broader range of general observation scenarios involving production, transport and systems interaction of hyperpolarized compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving a balance between computational speed, prediction accuracy, and universal applicability in molecular simulations has been a persistent challenge. This paper presents substantial advancements in the TorchMD-Net software, a pivotal step forward in the shift from conventional force fields to neural network-based potentials. The evolution of TorchMD-Net into a more comprehensive and versatile framework is highlighted, incorporating cutting-edge architectures such as TensorNet. This transformation is achieved through a modular design approach, encouraging customized applications within the scientific community. The most notable enhancement is a significant improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a very remarkable acceleration in the computation of energy and forces for TensorNet models, with performance gains ranging from 2-fold to 10-fold over previous iterations. Other enhancements include highly optimized neighbor search algorithms that support periodic boundary conditions and the smooth integration with existing molecular dynamics frameworks. Additionally, the updated version introduces the capability to integrate physical priors, further enriching its application spectrum and utility in research. The software is available at https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net.</description>

      <title>Solvent Selectivity controls Micro- versus Macro-phase Separation in Multiblock Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble were used to obtain critical parameters and conditions leading to microphase separation for block copolymers with solvophilic and solvophobic segments. Solvent selectivity was systematically varied to distinguish between systems that undergo macrophase separation to ones that microphase separate in the dilute phase, prior to macrophase separating. Finite-size scaling was used to obtain the critical parameters. Interestingly, corrections to scaling increase significantly for systems that form finite aggregates. The threshold value of solvent selectivity for aggregation was determined for symmetric diblock chains of varying length. The results indicate that long diblock copolymers form micelles in the dilute phase prior to macrophase separation, even in marginally selective solvents. The dependence of critical temperature on solvent selectivity was obtained for triblock, multiblock, and alternating chains. For highly selective solvents, strong structuring of both dilute and dense phases makes it harder to reach equilibrium.</description>
