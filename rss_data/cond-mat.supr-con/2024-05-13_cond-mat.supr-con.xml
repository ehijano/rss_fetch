      <title>Quasiparticle and superfluid dynamics in Magic-Angle Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene shows a wide range of correlated phases which are electrostatically tunable. Despite a growing knowledge of the material, there is yet no consensus on the microscopic mechanisms driving its superconducting phase. In particular, elucidating the symmetry and formation mechanism of the superconducting phase may provide key insights for the understanding of unconventional, strongly coupled and topological superconductivity. A major obstacle to progress in this direction is that key thermodynamic properties, such as specific heat, electron-phonon coupling and superfluid stiffness, are extremely challenging to measure due to the 2D nature of the material and its relatively low energy scales. Here, we use a gate-defined, radio frequency-biased, Josephson junction to probe the electronic dynamics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We reveal both the electronic quasiparticle dynamics, driven by their thermalization through phonon scattering, as well as the condensate dynamics, driven by the inertia of Cooper pairs. From these properties we recover the evolution of thermalization rates, and the superfluid stiffness across the phase diagram. Our findings favor an anisotropic or nodal pairing state and allow to estimate the strength of electron-phonon coupling. These results contribute to understanding the underlying mechanisms of superconductivity in MATBG while establishing an easy-to-implement method for characterizing thermal and superfluid properties of superconducting 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Superconductivity in Monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity has attracted significant attention due to its potential applications in quantum computation, but its experimental realization remains challenging. Recently, monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ was observed to exhibit gate tunable superconductivity, and its in-plane upper critical field exceeds the Pauli limit. Here, we show that an in-plane magnetic field beyond the Pauli limit can drive the superconducting monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ into a topological superconductor. The topological superconductivity arises from the interplay between the in-plane Zeeman coupling and the unique \emph{Ising plus in-plane SOC} in the monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$. The \emph{Ising plus in-plane SOC} plays the essential role to enable the effective $p_x+ip_y$ pairing. Importantly, as the essential \emph{Ising plus in-plane SOC} in the monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ is generated by an in-plane polar field, our proposal demonstrates that applying an in-plane magnetic field to a gate tunable 2D superconductor with an in-plane polar axis is a feasible way to realize topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Gate-Controlled Superconducting Dayem Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local control of superconducting circuits by high-impedance electrical gates offers potential advantages in superconducting logic, quantum processing units, and cryoelectronics. Recent experiments have reported gate-controlled supercurrent in Dayem bridges made of metallic superconductors, mediated by direct current leakage, out-of-equilibrium phonons, or possibly other mechanisms. However, a time-domain characterization of this effect has been lacking. Here, we integrate Dayem bridges made of Niobium on Silicon into coplanar-waveguide resonators, and measure the effect of the gate voltage at steady state and during pulsed operation. We consider two types of arrangements for the gate: a side-coupled gate and a remote injector. In both cases, we observe sizable changes in the real and the imaginary part of the constriction's impedance for gate voltages of the order of 1 V. However, we find striking differences in the time-domain dynamics, with the remote injector providing a faster and more controlled response. Our results contribute to our understanding of gate-controlled superconducting devices and their suitability for applications.</description>

      <title>Growth and Structure of alpha-Ta films for Quantum Circuit Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tantalum films incorporated into superconducting circuits have empirically low surface losses, resulting in long-lived qubit states. Remaining loss pathways originate in microscopic defects which manifest as two level systems (TLS) at low temperature. Defects bound qubit performance, recommending careful consideration of tantalum film structures. Here we investigate the growth of tantalum on sapphire, Si, and photoresist substrates by magnetron sputtering. In the case of sapphire, we present procedures for growth of fully-oriented films with alpha-Ta [1 1 1] // Al2O3 [0 0 1] and alpha-Ta [1 -1 0] // Al2O3 [1 0 0] having residual resistivity ratios ~ 60 for 220 nm thick films. On Si, we find a complex grain texturing with Ta [1 1 0] normal to the substrate and RRR ~ 30. We also demonstrate airbridge fabrication using Nb to nucleate alpha-Ta on photoresist surfaces. Superconducting resonators patterned from films on sapphire show TLS-limited quality factors averaging 1.6 +/- 0.4 x 10^6 at 10 mK. Structural characterization using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, low temperature transport, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy describe the dependence of residual impurities and screw dislocation density on processing conditions.</description>

      <title>Feynman Paradox about the Josephson effect and a sawtooth current in the double junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Feynman approach to the Josephson effect, which employs a pair of linear coupling equations for its modeling. It is found that while the exact solutions can account for the AC Josephson effect when the coupling strength is significantly less than the voltage, they fail to produce the DC Josephson effect in any practical scenario. To address this fundamental discrepancy, we derive the coupled Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for two interconnected superconductors based on BCS theory. These equations reveal that the nonlinear coupling, which is overlooked in the Feynman method, is crucial in describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, a critical factor for achieving the DC Josephson effect. When the coupled GL equations are applied to a double junction, a sawtooth current pattern emerges, a result unattainable via the Feynman approach.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau simulations of three-terminal operation of a superconducting nanowire cryotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire cryotrons (nTrons) are expected to be used as interfaces for super-high-performance hybrid devices in which superconductor and semiconductor circuits are combined. However, nTrons are still under development, and diverse analyses of these devices are needed. Accordingly, we have developed a numerical technique to simulate the three-terminal operation of an nTron by using the finite element method to solve the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation and the heat-diffusion equation. Simulations using this technique offer understanding of the dynamics of the order parameter, the thermal behavior, and the characteristics of three-terminal operation, and the TDGL model reproduces qualitatively the results of nTron experiments. In addition, we investigated how some geometric and physical parameters (the design elements) affect the operation characteristics. The TDGL model has far fewer free parameters compared with the lumped-element electrothermal model commonly used for simulating superconducting devices. Furthermore, the TDGL model provides time-dependent visual information about the superconducting state and the normal state, thereby offering insights into the relationship between nTron geometry and three-terminal operation. These simulation results offer a route to nTron optimization and the development of nTron applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dependence of critical currents of cross-type Josephson junctions with inhomogeneous critical current density under oblique magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the magnetic interference of sandwich-type Josephson junctions in which perpendicular or oblique magnetic fields are applied to the junction plane have received less attention than those where the applied magnetic fields are parallel. Recently, it has been theoretically demonstrated that a variety of magnetic interferences of the critical currents appear when oblique magnetic fields are applied to a cross-type junction with homogeneous critical current density. We theoretically investigated the effect of the inhomogeneous critical current density in the junction plane, and found that more complicated magnetic interferences appeared. We considered the distribution of the current density flowing through the junction plane to explore the cause of these complex magnetic interferences.</description>

      <title>Gate-controlled superconducting proximity effect of superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of 2D materials opens up unprecedented opportunities to design new materials with specified properties. In many cases, the design guiding principle is based on one or another proximity effect, i.e. the nanoscale-penetration of electronic correlations from one material to another. In a few layer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures the proximity regions occupy the entire system. Here we demonstrate that the physics of magnetic and superconducting proximity effects in 2D superconductor/ferromagnet vdW heterostructures is determined by the effects of interface hybridization of the electronic spectra of both materials. The degree of hybridization can be adjusted by gating, which makes it possible to achieve a high degree of controllability of the proximity effect. In particular, we show that this allows for electrical switching of superconductivity in such structures on and off, as well as for control of the amplitude and sign of the Zeeman splitting of superconducting spectra.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic paramagnetic response of topological Majorana surface states in the superconductor $\text{UTe}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the superconducting gap symmetry and topological signatures in the putative spin-triplet superconductor $\text{UTe}_2$ is an important issue. Especially, a smoking-gun detection scheme for Majorana surface states hallmarking topological superconductivity in $\text{UTe}_2$ is still lacking. In this study, we examine the surface spin susceptibility of $\text{UTe}_2$ with a particular focus on the contribution of the surface states. We find that Majorana surface states contribute significantly to the surface spin susceptibility, and give rise to an Ising-like anisotropy and anomalous enhancement in the surface spin susceptibility. We calculate the surface spin susceptibility as well as the local density of states using the recursive Green's function method and examine the anisotropy of the surface spin susceptibility in terms of the topological surface states and symmetry for all irreducible representations of odd-parity pairing states. Our results indicate that the Ising anisotropy and the anomalous enhancement are attributed to the Majorana surface state protected by the crystalline symmetry. These findings suggest the possibility of detecting the Majorana surface state via magnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconductive circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconductive InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Andreev reflection in a one-dimensional square-well pair-potential. We discuss the history of the model. The current-phase relation is presented as a sum over Matsubara frequencies. How the current arises from bound and continuum levels is found by analytic continuation. We discuss two limiting cases of square-well model, the zero-length well and the infinite well. The model is quantitatively valid in some cases, but forms the basis for understanding a wide range of problems in inhomogeneous superconductivity and superfluidity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that when a honeycomb antiferromagnetic insulator (AFMI) is sandwiched between two transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers in a commensurate way, magnons in the AFMI can mediate an interaction between electrons in the TMDs that gives rise to interlayer Cooper pairing. This interaction opens coexisting extended $s$-wave and chiral $p$-wave superconducting gaps in the energy spectrum of the coupled system, and the latter give rise to topological Majorana edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing financial and environmental cost of many inorganic materials has motivated study into organic and "green" alternatives. However, most organic compounds contain a large number of atoms in the primitive unit cell, posing a significant barrier to high-throughput screening for functional properties. In this work, we attempt to overcome this challenge and identify superconducting candidates among the metal-organic-frameworks in the organic materials database using a recently proposed proxy for the electron-phonon coupling. We then isolate the most promising candidate for in-depth analysis, C$_{9}$H$_{8}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{11}$, providing evidence for superconductivity below $100$mK.</description>

      <title>Plasmon dispersion in bilayer cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The essential building blocks of cuprate superconductors are two-dimensional CuO$_2$ sheets interspersed with charge reservoir layers. In bilayer cuprates, two closely spaced CuO$_2$ sheets are separated by a larger distance from the subsequent pair in the next unit cell. In contrast to single-layer cuprates, prior theoretical work on bilayer systems has predicted two distinct acoustic plasmon bands for a given out-of-plane momentum transfer. Here we report random phase approximation (RPA) calculations for bilayer systems which corroborate the existence of two distinct plasmons bands. We find that the intensity of the lower-energy band is negligibly small, whereas the higher-energy band carries significant spectral weight. We also present resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments at the O $K$-edge on the bilayer cuprate Y$_{0.85}$Ca$_{0.15}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (Ca-YBCO), which show only one dispersive plasmon branch, in agreement with the RPA calculations. In addition, the RPA results indicate that the dispersion of the higher-energy plasmon band in Ca-YBCO is not strictly acoustic, but exhibits a substantial energy gap of approximately 250 meV at the two-dimensional Brillouin zone center.</description>

      <title>Signature of T$_\textrm{c}$ above 111 K in Li-doped (Bi,Pb)-2223 superconductors: synergistic nature of hole concentration, coherence length and Josephson interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the bottleneck to drive higher critical transition temperature $T_\textrm{c}$ plays a pivotal role in the underlying study of superconductors. We systematically investigate the effect of Li$^+$ substitution for Cu$^{2+}$ cations on the $T_\textrm{c}$, hole concentration, coherence length and interlayer coupling, and microstructure in Li-doped Bi$_{1.6}$Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10 + \delta}$ or (Bi,Pb)-2223 compound. Remarkably, we demonstrate by utilizing a long-time sintering accompanied by a multiple recurrent intermediate stages of calcining and pressing within our renovated solid-state reaction method, the optimal Li-doped (Bi,Pb)-2223 samples achieve the well-enhanced $T_\textrm{c}$ of 111--113.8 K compared with the standard value of 110 K. We evince the superconducting mechanism that the substitution of Li$^{+}$ for Cu$^{2+}$ ions on the CuO$_2$ layers causes augmenting the hole concentrations and promotes the correlation between the overdoped outer and the underdoped inner CuO$_2$ planes, and thus effects improve $T_\textrm{c}$. Following a universal quadratic relation between $T_\textrm{c}$ and hole concentration, a new higher optimal hole concentration is provided. Additionally, by analyzing the Aslamazov-Larkin and Lawrence-Doniach theories on the reliable excess conductivity data near the critical temperature, we observe the strong effect of Li-doping on the system. The coherence length steadily increases versus the Li-doped content, while the Josephson interlayer coupling strength between the CuO$_2$ layers almost remains a constant for the whole series of Li-doping. Our findings establish an insightful roadmap to improve the critical temperature and intrinsic superconducting properties in the Bi-2223 compounds through the doping process.</description>

      <title>Entangling interactions between artificial atoms mediated by a multimode left-handed superconducting ring resonator</title>

Abstract: Superconducting metamaterial transmission lines implemented with lumped circuit elements can exhibit left-handed dispersion, where the group and phase velocity have opposite sign, in a frequency range relevant for superconducting artificial atoms. Forming such a metamaterial transmission line into a ring and coupling it to qubits at different points around the ring results in a multimode bus resonator with a compact footprint. Using flux-tunable qubits, we characterize and theoretically model the variation in the coupling strength between the two qubits and each of the ring resonator modes. Although the qubits have negligible direct coupling between them, their interactions with the multimode ring resonator result in both a transverse exchange coupling and a higher order $ZZ$ interaction between the qubits. As we vary the detuning between the qubits and their frequency relative to the ring resonator modes, we observe significant variations in both of these inter-qubit interactions, including zero crossings and changes of sign. The ability to modulate interaction terms such as the $ZZ$ scale between zero and large values for small changes in qubit frequency provides a promising pathway for implementing entangling gates in a system capable of hosting many qubits.</description>

      <title>Suppression of quasiparticle poisoning in transmon qubits by gap engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of various superconducting devices operating at ultra-low temperatures is impaired by the presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles. Inelastic quasiparticle (QP) tunneling across Josephson junctions in superconducting qubits results in decoherence and spurious excitations and, notably, can trigger correlated errors that severely impede quantum error correction. In this work, we use "gap engineering" to suppress the tunneling of low-energy quasiparticles in Al-based transmon qubits, a leading building block for superconducting quantum processors. By implementing potential barriers for QP, we strongly suppress QP tunneling across the junction and preserve charge parity for over $10^3$ seconds. The suppression of QP tunneling also results in a reduction in the qubit energy relaxation rates. The demonstrated approach to gap engineering can be easily implemented in all Al-based circuits with Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of spin density waves in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ up to 80 K in the double-layer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure has drawn great attention. Here we report the positive muon spin relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) study of polycrystalline La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.92}$ under ambient pressure. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR experiments reveal the existence of magnetic order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.92}$ with $T_{N}=154\ \rm{K}$. The weak transverse field $\mu^+$SR measurements confirms the bulk nature of magnetism. In addition, a small quantity of oxygen deficiencies can greatly broaden the internal magnetic field distribution sensed by muons.</description>

      <title>A High Resolution Dilatometer Using Optical Fiber Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a high performance differential dilatometer based on an all-fiber Michelson interferometer at cryogenic temperature with $10^{-10}$ resolution in $\delta L/L$. It resolve the linear thermal expansion coefficient by measuring the oscillating changes of sample thickness and sample temperature with the interferometer and in-situ thermometer, respectively. By measuring the linear thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ near the antiferromagnetic transition region of BaFe$_2$As$_2$ as a demonstration, we show our dilatometer is able to measure thin samples with sub-pm-level length change resolution and mK-level temperature resolution. Despite there is residual background thermal expansion of a few nm/K in measurement result, our new dilatometer is sitll a powerful tool for study of phase transition in condensed matter physics, especially significant advantages in fragile materials with sub-100$\mu$m thickness and being integrated with multiple synchronous measurements and tuning thanks to the extremely high resolution and contactless nature. The prototype design of this setup can be further improved in many aspects for specific applications.</description>
