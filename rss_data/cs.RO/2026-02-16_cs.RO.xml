      <title>LatentAM: Real-Time, Large-Scale Latent Gaussian Attention Mapping via Online Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LatentAM, an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) mapping framework that builds scalable latent feature maps from streaming RGB-D observations for open-vocabulary robotic perception. Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage. Experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale custom dataset demonstrate that LatentAM attains significantly better feature reconstruction fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods, while achieving near-real-time speed (12-35 FPS) on the evaluated datasets.

      <title>ForeAct: Steering Your VLA with Efficient Visual Foresight Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models convert high-level language instructions into concrete, executable actions, a task that is especially challenging in open-world environments. We present Visual Foresight Planning (ForeAct), a general and efficient planner that guides a VLA step-by-step using imagined future observations and subtask descriptions. With an imagined future observation, the VLA can focus on visuo-motor inference rather than high-level semantic reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our planner comprises a highly efficient foresight image generation module that predicts a high-quality 640$\times$480 future observation from the current visual input and language instruction within only 0.33s on an H100 GPU, together with a vision-language model that reasons over the task and produces subtask descriptions for both the generator and the VLA. Importantly, state-of-the-art VLAs can integrate our planner seamlessly by simply augmenting their visual inputs, without any architectural modification. The foresight generator is pretrained on over 1 million multi-task, cross-embodiment episodes, enabling it to learn robust embodied dynamics. We evaluate our framework on a benchmark that consists of 11 diverse, multi-step real-world tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 87.4%, demonstrating a +40.9% absolute improvement over the $\pi_0$ baseline (46.5%) and a +30.3% absolute improvement over $\pi_0$ augmented with textual subtask guidance (57.1%).</description>

      <title>Schur-MI: Fast Mutual Information for Robotic Information Gathering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a principled and widely used objective for robotic information gathering (RIG), providing strong theoretical guarantees for sensor placement (SP) and informative path planning (IPP). However, its high computational cost, dominated by repeated log-determinant evaluations, has limited its use in real-time planning. This letter presents Schur-MI, a Gaussian process (GP) MI formulation that (i) leverages the iterative structure of RIG to precompute and reuse expensive intermediate quantities across planning steps, and (ii) uses a Schur-complement factorization to avoid large determinant computations. Together, these methods reduce the per-evaluation cost of MI from $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{V}|^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{A}|^3)$, where $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denote the candidate and selected sensing locations, respectively. Experiments on real-world bathymetry datasets show that Schur-MI achieves up to a $12.7\times$ speedup over the standard MI formulation. Field trials with an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) performing adaptive IPP further validate its practicality. By making MI computation tractable for online planning, Schur-MI helps bridge the gap between information-theoretic objectives and real-time robotic exploration.</description>

      <title>LongNav-R1: Horizon-Adaptive Multi-Turn RL for Long-Horizon VLA Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops LongNav-R1, an end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to optimize Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models for long-horizon navigation. Unlike existing single-turn paradigm, LongNav-R1 reformulates the navigation decision process as a continuous multi-turn conversation between the VLA policy and the embodied environment. This multi-turn RL framework offers two distinct advantages: i) it enables the agent to reason about the causal effects of historical interactions and sequential future outcomes; and ii) it allows the model to learn directly from online interactions, fostering diverse trajectory generation and avoiding the behavioral rigidity often imposed by human demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Horizon-Adaptive Policy Optimization. This mechanism explicitly accounts for varying horizon lengths during advantage estimation, facilitating accurate temporal credit assignment over extended sequences. Consequently, the agent develops diverse navigation behaviors and resists collapse during long-horizon tasks. Experiments on object navigation benchmarks validate the framework's efficacy: With 4,000 rollout trajectories, LongNav-R1 boosts the Qwen3-VL-2B success rate from 64.3% to 73.0%. These results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. The model's generalizability and robustness are further validated by its zero-shot performance in long-horizon real-world navigation settings. All source code will be open-sourced upon publication.</description>

      <title>Predicting Dynamic Map States from Limited Field-of-View Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When autonomous systems are deployed in real-world scenarios, sensors are often subject to limited field-of-view (FOV) constraints, either naturally through system design, or through unexpected occlusions or sensor failures. In conditions where a large FOV is unavailable, it is important to be able to infer information about the environment and predict the state of nearby surroundings based on available data to maintain safe and accurate operation. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of deep learning for dynamic map state prediction based on limited FOV time series data. We show that by representing dynamic sensor data in a simple single-image format that captures both spatial and temporal information, we can effectively use a wide variety of existing image-to-image learning models to predict map states with high accuracy in a diverse set of sensing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Adaptation to Robot Structural Damage via Natural Language-Informed Kinodynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance autonomous mobile robots endure significant mechanical stress during in-the-wild operations, e.g., driving at high speeds or over rugged terrain. Although these platforms are engineered to withstand such conditions, mechanical degradation is inevitable. Structural damage manifests as consistent and notable changes in kinodynamic behavior compared to a healthy vehicle. Given the heterogeneous nature of structural failures, quantifying various damages to inform kinodynamics is challenging. We posit that natural language can describe and thus capture this variety of damages. Therefore, we propose Zero-shot Language Informed Kinodynamics (ZLIK), which employs self-supervised learning to ground semantic information of damage descriptions in kinodynamic behaviors to learn a forward kinodynamics model in a data-driven manner. Using the high-fidelity soft-body physics simulator BeamNG.tech, we collect data from a variety of structurally compromised vehicles. Our learned model achieves zero-shot adaptation to different damages with up to 81% reduction in kinodynamics error and generalizes across the sim-to-real and full-to-1/10$^{\text{th}}$ scale gaps.</description>

      <title>Self-Refining Vision Language Model for Robotic Failure Detection and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning about failures is crucial for building reliable and trustworthy robotic systems. Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

      <title>MiDAS: A Multimodal Data Acquisition System and Dataset for Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) research increasingly relies on multimodal data, yet access to proprietary robot telemetry remains a major barrier. We introduce MiDAS, an open-source, platform-agnostic system enabling time-synchronized, non-invasive multimodal data acquisition across surgical robotic platforms.
  Methods: MiDAS integrates electromagnetic and RGB-D hand tracking, foot pedal sensing, and surgical video capturing without requiring proprietary robot interfaces. We validated MiDAS on the open-source Raven-II and the clinical da Vinci Xi by collecting multimodal datasets of peg transfer and hernia repair suturing tasks performed by surgical residents. Correlation analysis and downstream gesture recognition experiments were conducted.
  Results: External hand and foot sensing closely approximated internal robot kinematics and non-invasive motion signals achieved gesture recognition performance comparable to proprietary telemetry.
  Conclusion: MiDAS enables reproducible multimodal RMIS data collection and is released with annotated datasets, including the first multimodal dataset capturing hernia repair suturing on high-fidelity simulation models.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions with Audio Risk Awareness for Robot Safe Navigation on Construction Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction automation increasingly requires autonomous mobile robots, yet robust autonomy remains challenging on construction sites. These environments are dynamic and often visually occluded, which complicates perception and navigation. In this context, valuable information from audio sources remains underutilized in most autonomy stacks. This work presents a control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter that provides safety guarantees for obstacle avoidance while adapting safety margins during navigation using an audio-derived risk cue. The proposed framework augments the CBF with a lightweight, real-time jackhammer detector based on signal envelope and periodicity. Its output serves as an exogenous risk that is directly enforced in the controller by modulating the barrier function. The approach is evaluated in simulation with two CBF formulations (circular and goal-aligned elliptical) with a unicycle robot navigating a cluttered construction environment. Results show that the CBF safety filter eliminates safety violations across all trials while reaching the target in 40.2% (circular) vs. 76.5% (elliptical), as the elliptical formulation better avoids deadlock. This integration of audio perception into a CBF-based controller demonstrates a pathway toward richer multimodal safety reasoning in autonomous robots for safety-critical and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>An Autonomous, End-to-End, Convex-Based Framework for Close-Range Rendezvous Trajectory Design and Guidance with Hardware Testbed Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous satellite servicing missions must execute close-range rendezvous under stringent safety and operational constraints while remaining computationally tractable for onboard use and robust to uncertainty in sensing, actuation, and dynamics. This paper presents CORTEX (Convex Optimization for Rendezvous Trajectory Execution), an autonomous, perception-enabled, real-time trajectory design and guidance framework for close-range rendezvous. CORTEX integrates a deep-learning perception pipeline with convex-optimisation-based trajectory design and guidance, including reference regeneration and abort-to-safe-orbit logic to recover from large deviations caused by sensor faults and engine failures.
  CORTEX is validated in high-fidelity software simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The software pipeline (Basilisk) models high-fidelity relative dynamics, realistic thruster execution, perception, and attitude control. Hardware testing uses (i) an optical navigation testbed to assess perception-to-estimation performance and (ii) a planar air-bearing testbed to evaluate the end-to-end guidance loop under representative actuation and subsystem effects. A Monte-Carlo campaign in simulation includes initial-state uncertainty, thrust-magnitude errors, and missed-thrust events; under the strongest case investigated, CORTEX achieves terminal docking errors of $36.85 \pm 44.46$ mm in relative position and $1.25 \pm 2.26$ mm/s in relative velocity. On the planar air-bearing testbed, 18 cases are executed (10 nominal; 8 off-nominal requiring recomputation and/or abort due to simulated engine failure and sensor malfunctions), yielding terminal errors of $8.09 \pm 5.29$ mm in position and $2.23 \pm 1.72$ mm/s in velocity.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Enhanced Partitioned Gaussian Processes for Real-Time Quadrotor Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quadrotor dynamics Gaussian Process (GP) with gradient information that achieves real-time inference via state-space partitioning and approximation, and that includes aerodynamic effects using data from mid-fidelity potential flow simulations. While traditional GP-based approaches provide reliable Bayesian predictions with uncertainty quantification, they are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for real-time simulations. To address this challenge, we integrate gradient information to improve accuracy and introduce a novel partitioning and approximation strategy to reduce online computational cost. In particular, for the latter, we associate a local GP with each non-overlapping region; by splitting the training data into local near and far subsets, and by using Schur complements, we show that a large part of the matrix inversions required for inference can be performed offline, enabling real-time inference at frequencies above 30 Hz on standard desktop hardware. To generate a training dataset that captures aerodynamic effects, such as rotor-rotor interactions and apparent wind direction, we use the CHARM code, which is a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver. It is applied to the SUI Endurance quadrotor to predict force and torque, along with noise at three specified locations. The derivative information is obtained via finite differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed partitioned GP with gradient conditioning achieves higher accuracy than standard partitioned GPs without gradient information, while greatly reducing computational time. This framework provides an efficient foundation for real-time aerodynamic prediction and control algorithms in complex and unsteady environments.</description>

      <title>Composable Model-Free RL for Navigation with Input-Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous robots move into complex, dynamic real-world environments, they must learn to navigate safely in real time, yet anticipating all possible behaviors is infeasible. We propose a composable, model-free reinforcement learning method that learns a value function and an optimal policy for each individual environment element (e.g., goal or obstacle) and composes them online to achieve goal reaching and collision avoidance. Assuming unknown nonlinear dynamics that evolve in continuous time and are input-affine, we derive a continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function and show that the corresponding advantage function is quadratic in the action and optimal policy. Based on this structure, we introduce a model-free actor-critic algorithm that learns policies and value functions for static or moving obstacles using gradient descent. We then compose multiple reach/avoid models via a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), yielding formal obstacle-avoidance guarantees in terms of value-function level sets, providing a model-free alternative to CLF/CBF-based controllers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance over a PPO baseline applied to a discrete-time approximation.</description>

      <title>Monocular Reconstruction of Neural Tactile Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots operating in the real world must plan through environments that deform, yield, and reconfigure under contact, requiring interaction-aware 3D representations that extend beyond static geometric occupancy. To address this, we introduce neural tactile fields, a novel 3D representation that maps spatial locations to the expected tactile response upon contact. Our model predicts these neural tactile fields from a single monocular RGB image -- the first method to do so. When integrated with off-the-shelf path planners, neural tactile fields enable robots to generate paths that avoid high-resistance objects while deliberately routing through low-resistance regions (e.g. foliage), rather than treating all occupied space as equally impassable. Empirically, our learning framework improves volumetric 3D reconstruction by $85.8\%$ and surface reconstruction by $26.7\%$ compared to state-of-the-art monocular 3D reconstruction methods (LRM and Direct3D).</description>

      <title>CRAFT: Adapting VLA Models to Contact-rich Manipulation via Force-aware Curriculum Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown a strong capability in enabling robots to execute general instructions, yet they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks, where success requires precise alignment, stable contact maintenance, and effective handling of deformable objects. A fundamental challenge arises from the imbalance between high-entropy vision and language inputs and low-entropy but critical force signals, which often leads to over-reliance on perception and unstable control. To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that CRAFT consistently improves task success, generalizes to unseen objects and novel task variations, and adapts effectively across diverse VLA architectures, enabling robust and generalizable contact-rich manipulation.</description>

      <title>Eva-Tracker: ESDF-update-free, Visibility-aware Planning with Target Reacquisition for Robust Aerial Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) is widely used in visibility evaluation to prevent occlusions and collisions during tracking. However, frequent ESDF updates introduce considerable computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose Eva-Tracker, a visibility-aware trajectory planning framework for aerial tracking that eliminates ESDF updates and incorporates a recovery-capable path generation method for target reacquisition. First, we design a target trajectory prediction method and a visibility-aware initial path generation algorithm that maintain an appropriate observation distance, avoid occlusions, and enable rapid replanning to reacquire the target when it is lost. Then, we propose the Field of View ESDF (FoV-ESDF), a precomputed ESDF tailored to the tracker's field of view, enabling rapid visibility evaluation without requiring updates. Finally, we optimize the trajectory using differentiable FoV-ESDF-based objectives to ensure continuous visibility throughout the tracking process. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust tracking results with lower computational effort than existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Hemispherical Angular Power Mapping of Installed mmWave Radar Modules Under Realistic Deployment Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the angular radiation behavior of installed millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar modules is increasingly important in practical sensing platforms, where packaging, mounting hardware, and nearby structures can significantly alter the effective emission profile. However, once a device is embedded in its host environment, conventional chamber- and turntable-based antenna measurements are often impractical. This paper presents a hemispherical angular received-power mapping methodology for in-situ EM validation of installed mmWave modules under realistic deployment constraints. The approach samples the accessible half-space around a stationary device-under-test by placing a calibrated receiving probe at prescribed (phi, theta, r) locations using geometry-consistent positioning and quasi-static acquisition. Amplitude-only received-power is recorded using standard RF instrumentation to generate hemispherical angular power maps that capture installation-dependent radiation characteristics. Proof-of-concept measurements on a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate repeatable hemi-spherical mapping with angular trends in good agreement with full-wave simulation, supporting practical on-site characterization of embedded mmWave transmitters.</description>

      <title>PISHYAR: A Socially Intelligent Smart Cane for Indoor Social Navigation and Multimodal Human-Robot Interaction for Visually Impaired People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents PISHYAR, a socially intelligent smart cane designed by our group to combine socially aware navigation with multimodal human-AI interaction to support both physical mobility and interactive assistance. The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.</description>

      <title>RLinf-Co: Reinforcement Learning-Based Sim-Real Co-Training for VLA Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \underline{\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \underline{\textit{Co}}-training \modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $\pi_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $\pi_{0.5}$. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.</description>

      <title>Real-to-Sim for Highly Cluttered Environments via Physics-Consistent Inter-Object Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing physically valid 3D scenes from single-view observations is a prerequisite for bridging the gap between visual perception and robotic control. However, in scenarios requiring precise contact reasoning, such as robotic manipulation in highly cluttered environments, geometric fidelity alone is insufficient. Standard perception pipelines often neglect physical constraints, resulting in invalid states, e.g., floating objects or severe inter-penetration, rendering downstream simulation unreliable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel physics-constrained Real-to-Sim pipeline that reconstructs physically consistent 3D scenes from single-view RGB-D data. Central to our approach is a differentiable optimization pipeline that explicitly models spatial dependencies via a contact graph, jointly refining object poses and physical properties through differentiable rigid-body simulation. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our reconstructed scenes achieve high physical fidelity and faithfully replicate real-world contact dynamics, enabling stable and reliable contact-rich manipulation.</description>

      <title>PMG: Parameterized Motion Generator for Human-like Locomotion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven reinforcement learning and motion tracking have substantially improved humanoid locomotion, yet critical practical challenges remain. In particular, while low-level motion tracking and trajectory-following controllers are mature, whole-body reference-guided methods are difficult to adapt to higher-level command interfaces and diverse task contexts: they require large, high-quality datasets, are brittle across speed and pose regimes, and are sensitive to robot-specific calibration. To address these limitations, we propose the Parameterized Motion Generator (PMG), a real-time motion generator grounded in an analysis of human motion structure that synthesizes reference trajectories using only a compact set of parameterized motion data together with High-dimensional control commands. Combined with an imitation-learning pipeline and an optimization-based sim-to-real motor parameter identification module, we validate the complete approach on our humanoid prototype ZERITH Z1 and show that, within a single integrated system, PMG produces natural, human-like locomotion, responds precisely to high-dimensional control inputs-including VR-based teleoperation-and enables efficient, verifiable sim-to-real transfer. Together, these results establish a practical, experimentally validated pathway toward natural and deployable humanoid control.</description>

      <title>Xiaomi-Robotics-0: An Open-Sourced Vision-Language-Action Model with Real-Time Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we introduce Xiaomi-Robotics-0, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model optimized for high performance and fast and smooth real-time execution. The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks. To facilitate future research, code and model checkpoints are open-sourced at https://xiaomi-robotics-0.github.io</description>

      <title>SignScene: Visual Sign Grounding for Mapless Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigational signs enable humans to navigate unfamiliar environments without maps. This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that it enables real-world mapless navigation on a Spot robot using only signs.</description>

      <title>ALOE: Action-Level Off-Policy Evaluation for Vision-Language-Action Model Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to improve large foundation vision-language-action (VLA) systems through online reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world settings. Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

      <title>Constrained PSO Six-Parameter Fuzzy PID Tuning Method for Balanced Optimization of Depth Tracking Performance in Underwater Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth control of underwater vehicles in engineering applications must simultaneously satisfy requirements for rapid tracking, low overshoot, and actuator constraints. Traditional fuzzy PID tuning often relies on empirical methods, making it difficult to achieve a stable and reproducible equilibrium solution between performance enhancement and control cost. This paper proposes a constrained particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for tuning six-parameter fuzzy PID controllers. By adjusting the benchmark PID parameters alongside the fuzzy controller's input quantization factor and output proportional gain, it achieves synergistic optimization of the overall tuning strength and dynamic response characteristics of the fuzzy PID system. To ensure engineering feasibility of the optimization results, a time-weighted absolute error integral, adjustment time, relative overshoot control energy, and saturation occupancy rate are introduced. Control energy constraints are applied to construct a constraint-driven comprehensive evaluation system, suppressing pseudo-improvements achieved solely by increasing control inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that, while maintaining consistent control energy and saturation levels, the proposed method significantly enhances deep tracking performance: the time-weighted absolute error integral decreases from 0.2631 to 0.1473, the settling time shortens from 2.301 s to 1.613 s, and the relative overshoot reduces from 0.1494 to 0.01839. Control energy varied from 7980 to 7935, satisfying the energy constraint, while saturation occupancy decreased from 0.004 to 0.003. These results validate the effectiveness and engineering significance of the proposed constrained six-parameter joint tuning strategy for depth control in underwater vehicle navigation scenarios.</description>

      <title>TRANS: Terrain-aware Reinforcement Learning for Agile Navigation of Quadruped Robots under Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces TRANS: Terrain-aware Reinforcement learning for Agile Navigation under Social interactions, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quadrupedal social navigation over unstructured terrains. Conventional quadrupedal navigation typically separates motion planning from locomotion control, neglecting whole-body constraints and terrain awareness. On the other hand, end-to-end methods are more integrated but require high-frequency sensing, which is often noisy and computationally costly. In addition, most existing approaches assume static environments, limiting their use in human-populated settings. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage training framework with three DRL pipelines. (1) TRANS-Loco employs an asymmetric actor-critic (AC) model for quadrupedal locomotion, enabling traversal of uneven terrains without explicit terrain or contact observations. (2) TRANS-Nav applies a symmetric AC framework for social navigation, directly mapping transformed LiDAR data to ego-agent actions under differential-drive kinematics. (3) A unified pipeline, TRANS, integrates TRANS-Loco and TRANS-Nav, supporting terrain-aware quadrupedal navigation in uneven and socially interactive environments. Comprehensive benchmarks against locomotion and social navigation baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of TRANS. Hardware experiments further confirm its potential for sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>Scaling Single Human Demonstrations for Imitation Learning using Generative Foundational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a popular paradigm to teach robots new tasks, but collecting robot demonstrations through teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching is tedious and time-consuming. In contrast, directly demonstrating a task using our human embodiment is much easier and data is available in abundance, yet transfer to the robot can be non-trivial. In this work, we propose Real2Gen to train a manipulation policy from a single human demonstration. Real2Gen extracts required information from the demonstration and transfers it to a simulation environment, where a programmable expert agent can demonstrate the task arbitrarily many times, generating an unlimited amount of data to train a flow matching policy. We evaluate Real2Gen on human demonstrations from three different real-world tasks and compare it to a recent baseline. Real2Gen shows an average increase in the success rate of 26.6% and better generalization of the trained policy due to the abundance and diversity of training data. We further deploy our purely simulation-trained policy zero-shot in the real world. We make the data, code, and trained models publicly available at real2gen.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

      <title>SafeFlowMPC: Predictive and Safe Trajectory Planning for Robot Manipulators with Learning-based Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging integration of robots into everyday life brings several major challenges. Compared to classical industrial applications, more flexibility is needed in combination with real-time reactivity. Learning-based methods can train powerful policies based on demonstrated trajectories, such that the robot generalizes a task to similar situations. However, these black-box models lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Optimization-based methods provide these guarantees but lack the required flexibility and generalization capabilities. This work proposes SafeFlowMPC, a combination of flow matching and online optimization to combine the strengths of learning and optimization. This method guarantees safety at all times and is designed to meet the demands of real-time execution by using a suboptimal model-predictive control formulation. SafeFlowMPC achieves strong performance in three real-world experiments on a KUKA 7-DoF manipulator, namely two grasping experiment and a dynamic human-robot object handover experiment. A video of the experiments is available at http://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d6. The code is available at https://github.com/TU-Wien-ACIN-CDS/SafeFlowMPC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of surveillance applications involving small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) depends on how long the limited on-board power would persist. To cope with this challenge, alternative renewable sources of lift are sought. One promising solution is to extract energy from rising masses of buoyant air. This paper proposes a local-global behavioral management and decision-making approach for the autonomous deployment of soaring-capable UAVs. The cooperative UAVs are modeled as non-deterministic finite state-based rational agents. In addition to a mission planning module for assigning tasks and issuing dynamic navigation waypoints for a new path planning scheme, in which the concepts of visibility and prediction are applied to avoid the collisions. Moreover, a delayed learning and tuning strategy is employed optimize the gains of the path tracking controller. Rigorous comparative analyses carried out with three benchmarking baselines and 15 evolutionary algorithms highlight the adequacy of the proposed approach for maintaining the surveillance persistency (staying aloft for longer periods without landing) and maximizing the detection of targets (two times better than non-cooperative and semi-cooperative approaches) with less power consumption (almost 6% of battery consumed in six hours).</description>

      <title>Adding internal audio sensing to internal vision enables human-like in-hand fabric recognition with soft robotic fingertips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing the feel of smooth silk from coarse cotton is a trivial everyday task for humans. When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions. To show that this audio-visual tactile sensing approach generalizes beyond the training data, we learn general representations of fabric stretchiness, thickness, and roughness.</description>

      <title>INHerit-SG: Incremental Hierarchical Semantic Scene Graphs with RAG-Style Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by advancements in foundation models, semantic scene graphs have emerged as a prominent paradigm for high-level 3D environmental abstraction in robot navigation. However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

      <title>Learning Native Continuation for Action Chunking Flow Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action chunking enables Vision Language Action (VLA) models to run in real time, but naive chunked execution often exhibits discontinuities at chunk boundaries. Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.</description>

      <title>How Swarms Differ: Challenges in Collective Behaviour Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behaviours often need to be expressed through numerical features, e.g., for classification or imitation learning. This problem is often addressed by proposing an ad-hoc feature set for a particular swarm behaviour context, usually without further consideration of the solution's resilience outside of the conceived context. Yet, the development of automatic methods to design swarm behaviours is dependent on the ability to measure quantitatively the similarity of swarm behaviours. Hence, we investigate the impact of feature sets for collective behaviours. We select swarm feature sets and similarity measures from prior swarm robotics works, which mainly considered a narrow behavioural context and assess their robustness. We demonstrate that the interplay of feature set and similarity measure makes some combinations more suitable to distinguish groups of similar behaviours. We also propose a self-organised map-based approach to identify regions of the feature space where behaviours cannot be easily distinguished.</description>

      <title>SENSE-STEP: Learning Sim-to-Real Locomotion for a Sensory-Enabled Soft Quadruped Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust closed-loop locomotion remains challenging for soft quadruped robots due to high-dimensional dynamics, actuator hysteresis, and difficult-to-model contact interactions, while conventional proprioception provides limited information about ground contact. In this paper, we present a learning-based control framework for a pneumatically actuated soft quadruped equipped with tactile suction-cup feet, and we validate the approach experimentally on physical hardware. The control policy is trained in simulation through a staged learning process that starts from a reference gait and is progressively refined under randomized environmental conditions. The resulting controller maps proprioceptive and tactile feedback to coordinated pneumatic actuation and suction-cup commands, enabling closed-loop locomotion on flat and inclined surfaces. When deployed on the real robot, the closed-loop policy outperforms an open-loop baseline, increasing forward speed by 41% on a flat surface and by 91% on a 5-degree incline. Ablation studies further demonstrate the role of tactile force estimates and inertial feedback in stabilizing locomotion, with performance improvements of up to 56% compared to configurations without sensory feedback.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Robot Control: Flexible but still Fragile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work leverages the capabilities and commonsense priors of generative models for robot control. In this paper, we present an agentic control system in which a reasoning-capable language model plans and executes tasks by selecting and invoking robot skills within an iterative planner and executor loop. We deploy the system on two physical robot platforms in two settings: (i) tabletop grasping, placement, and box insertion in indoor mobile manipulation (Mobipick) and (ii) autonomous agricultural navigation and sensing (Valdemar). Both settings involve uncertainty, partial observability, sensor noise, and ambiguous natural-language commands. The system exposes structured introspection of its planning and decision process, reacts to exogenous events via explicit event checks, and supports operator interventions that modify or redirect ongoing execution. Across both platforms, our proof-of-concept experiments reveal substantial fragility, including non-deterministic suboptimal behavior, instruction-following errors, and high sensitivity to prompt specification. At the same time, the architecture is flexible: transfer to a different robot and task domain largely required updating the system prompt (domain model, affordances, and action catalogue) and re-binding the same tool interface to the platform-specific skill API.</description>

      <title>UniManip: General-Purpose Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation with Agentic Operational Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation requires robots to seamlessly bridge high-level semantic intent with low-level physical interaction in unstructured environments. However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

      <title>Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices for Autonomous Ground Robot Navigation in Partially Observed Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to sensor limitations, environments that off-road mobile robots operate in are often only partially observable. As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Human Emotion-Mediated Soft Robotic Arts: Exploring the Intersection of Human Emotions, Soft Robotics and Arts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotics has emerged as a versatile field with applications across various domains, from healthcare to industrial automation, and more recently, art and interactive installations. The inherent flexibility, adaptability, and safety of soft robots make them ideal for applications that require delicate, organic, and lifelike movement, allowing for immersive and responsive interactions. This study explores the intersection of human emotions, soft robotics, and art to establish and create new forms of human emotion-mediated soft robotic art. In this paper, we introduce two soft embodiments: a soft character and a soft flower as an art display that dynamically responds to brain signals based on alpha waves, reflecting different emotion levels. We present how human emotions can be measured as alpha waves based on brain/EEG signals, how we map the alpha waves to the dynamic movements of the two soft embodiments, and demonstrate our proposed concept using experiments. The findings of this study highlight how soft robotics can embody human emotional states, offering a new medium for insightful artistic expression and interaction, and demonstrating how art displays can be embodied.</description>

      <title>Steerable Vision-Language-Action Policies for Embodied Reasoning and Hierarchical Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) can make semantic and visual inferences across diverse settings, providing valuable common-sense priors for robotic control. However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.

      <title>Imitating What Works: Simulation-Filtered Modular Policy Learning from Human Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to learn manipulation skills by watching videos of humans has the potential to unlock a new source of highly scalable data for robot learning. Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Cubature Kalman Filter for Attitude and Heading Reference Systems Using Simplified Prediction Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRSs) are broadly applied wherever reliable orientation and motion sensing is required. In this paper, we present an improved Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) with lower computational cost while maintaining estimation accuracy, which is named "Kaisoku Cubature Kalman Filter (KCKF)". The computationally efficient equations of the KCKF are derived by simplifying those of the CKF, while preserving equivalent mathematical relations. The lightweight prediction equations in the KCKF are derived by expanding the summation terms in the CKF and simplifying the result. This paper shows that the KCKF requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) than the CKF. The controlled experimental results show that the KCKF reduces the computation time by approximately 19% compared to the CKF on a high-performance computer, whereas the KCKF reduces the computation time by approximately 15% compared to the CKF on a low-cost single-board computer. In addition, the KCKF maintains the attitude estimation accuracy of the CKF.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation of Articulated Components in Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growth of intelligent civil infrastructure and smart cities, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) increasingly requires safe, efficient, and energy-conscious robotic manipulation of articulated components, including access doors, service drawers, and pipeline valves. However, existing robotic approaches either focus primarily on grasping or target object-specific articulated manipulation, and they rarely incorporate explicit actuation energy into multi-objective optimisation, which limits their scalability and suitability for long-term deployment in real O&amp;M settings. Therefore, this paper proposes an articulation-agnostic and energy-aware reinforcement learning framework for robotic manipulation in intelligent infrastructure O&amp;M. The method combines part-guided 3D perception, weighted point sampling, and PointNet-based encoding to obtain a compact geometric representation that generalises across heterogeneous articulated objects. Manipulation is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), in which actuation energy is explicitly modelled and regulated via a Lagrangian-based constrained Soft Actor-Critic scheme. The policy is trained end-to-end under this CMDP formulation, enabling effective articulated-object operation while satisfying a long-horizon energy budget. Experiments on representative O&amp;M tasks demonstrate 16%-30% reductions in energy consumption, 16%-32% fewer steps to success, and consistently high success rates, indicating a scalable and sustainable solution for infrastructure O&amp;M manipulation.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised JEPA-based World Models for LiDAR Occupancy Completion and Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Autonomous driving, as an agent operating in the physical world, requires the fundamental capability to build \textit{world models} that capture how the environment evolves spatiotemporally in order to support long-term planning. At the same time, scalability demands learning such models in a self-supervised manner; \textit{joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA)} enables learning world models via leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data without relying on expensive human annotations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AD-LiST-JEPA}, a self-supervised world model for autonomous driving that predicts future spatiotemporal evolution from LiDAR data using a JEPA framework. We evaluate the quality of the learned representations through a downstream LiDAR-based occupancy completion and forecasting (OCF) task, which jointly assesses perception and prediction. Proof of concept experiments show better OCF performance with pretrained encoder after JEPA-based world model learning.</description>

      <title>When Environments Shift: Safe Planning with Generative Priors and Robust Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems operate in environments that may change over time. An example is the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles whose behavior may change based on factors such as traffic density, road visibility, and social norms. Therefore, the environment encountered during deployment rarely mirrors the environment and data encountered during training -- a phenomenon known as distribution shift -- which can undermine the safety of autonomous systems. Conformal prediction (CP) has recently been used along with data from the training environment to provide prediction regions that capture the behavior of the environment with a desired probability. When embedded within a model predictive controller (MPC), one can provide probabilistic safety guarantees, but only when the deployment and training environments coincide. Once a distribution shift occurs, these guarantees collapse. We propose a planning framework that is robust under distribution shifts by: (i) assuming that the underlying data distribution of the environment is parameterized by a nuisance parameter, i.e., an observable, interpretable quantity such as traffic density, (ii) training a conditional diffusion model that captures distribution shifts as a function of the nuisance parameter, (iii) observing the nuisance parameter online and generating cheap, synthetic data from the diffusion model for the observed nuisance parameter, and (iv) designing an MPC that embeds CP regions constructed from such synthetic data. Importantly, we account for discrepancies between the underlying data distribution and the diffusion model by using robust CP. Thus, the plans computed using robust CP enjoy probabilistic safety guarantees, in contrast with plans obtained from a single, static set of training data. We empirically demonstrate safety under diverse distribution shifts in the ORCA simulator.</description>

      <title>Dual-Granularity Contrastive Reward via Generated Episodic Guidance for Efficient Embodied RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing suitable rewards poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially for embodied manipulation. Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.</description>

      <title>Media Framing Moderates Risk-Benefit Perceptions and Value Tradeoffs in Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public acceptance of industrial human-robot collaboration (HRC) is shaped by how risks and benefits are perceived by affected employees. Positive or negative media framing may shape and shift how individuals evaluate HRC. This study examines how message framing moderates the effects of perceived risks and perceived benefits on overall attributed value. In a pre-registered study, participants (N = 1150) were randomly assigned to read either a positively or negatively framed newspaper article in one of three industrial contexts (autonomy, employment, safety) about HRC in production. Subsequently, perceived risks, benefits, and value were measured using reliable and publicly available psychometric scales. Two multiple regressions (one per framing condition) tested for main and interaction effects. Framing influenced absolute evaluations of risk, benefits, and value. In both frames, risks and benefits significantly predicted attributed value. Under positive framing, only main effects were observed (risks: beta = -0.52; benefits: beta = 0.45). Under negative framing, both predictors had stronger main effects (risks: beta = -0.69; benefits: beta = 0.63) along with a significant negative interaction (beta = -0.32), indicating that higher perceived risk diminishes the positive effect of perceived benefits. Model fit was higher for the positive frame (R^2 = 0.715) than for the negative frame (R^2 = 0.583), indicating greater explained variance in value attributions. Framing shapes the absolute evaluation of HRC and how risks and benefits are cognitively integrated in trade-offs. Negative framing produces stronger but interdependent effects, whereas positive framing supports additive evaluations. These findings highlight the role of strategic communication in fostering acceptance of HRC and underscore the need to consider framing in future HRC research.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Algorithm for Model-Free Control Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presented is an algorithm to synthesize the optimal infinite-horizon LQR feedback controller for continuous-time systems. The algorithm does not require knowledge of the system dynamics but instead uses only a finite-length sampling of arbitrary input-output data. The algorithm is based on a constrained optimization problem that enforces a necessary condition on the dynamics of the optimal value function along any trajectory. In addition to calculating the standard LQR gain matrix, a feedforward gain can be found to implement a reference tracking controller. This paper presents a theoretical justification for the method and shows several examples, including a validation test on a real scale aircraft.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Robot Motion Planning for Manifold-Constrained Manipulators by Randomized Scheduling and Informed Path Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-robot motion planning for high degree-of-freedom manipulators in shared, constrained, and narrow spaces is a complex problem and essential for many scenarios such as construction, surgery, and more. Traditional coupled methods plan directly in the composite configuration space, which scales poorly; decoupled methods, on the other hand, plan separately for each robot but lack completeness. Hybrid methods that obtain paths from individual robots together require the enumeration of many paths before they can find valid composite solutions. This paper introduces Scheduling to Avoid Collisions (StAC), a hybrid approach that more effectively composes paths from individual robots by scheduling (adding stops and coordination motion along all paths) and generates paths that are likely to be feasible by using bidirectional feedback between the scheduler and motion planner for informed sampling. StAC uses 10 to 100 times fewer paths from the low-level planner than state-of-the-art hybrid baselines on challenging problems in manipulator cases.</description>

      <title>What Matters in Building Vision-Language-Action Models for Generalist Robots</title>

Abstract: To utilize Foundation Vision Language Models (VLMs) for robotic tasks and motion planning, the community has proposed different methods for injecting action components into VLMs and building the Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA on robot manipulation problems and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we prefer VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs framework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations of various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research. We open-source all details, including codes, models, datasets, and toolkits, along with detailed training and evaluation recipes at: robovlms.github.io.</description>

      <title>Auditory-Tactile Congruence for Synthesis of Adaptive Pain Expressions in RoboPatients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misdiagnosis can result in delayed treatment and patient harm. Robotic patient simulators (robopatients) provide a controlled framework for training and evaluating clinicians in rare and complex cases. We investigate auditory tactile congruence in the synthesis of adaptive vocal pain expressions for robopatients. The system generates pain vocalizations in response to tactile stimuli applied during abdominal palpation. Haptic input is captured through an abdominal phantom and processed using an internal palpation-to-pain mapping model that drives acoustic output. To evaluate perceptual congruence between palpation force and synthesized pain expressions, we conducted a study comprising 7,680 trials with 20 participants. Participants rated perceived pain intensity based solely on auditory feedback. We analyzed the influence of acoustic parameters on agreement between applied force and perceived pain. Results indicate that amplitude and pitch significantly affect perceptual agreement, independent of pain sound category. Increased palpation force was associated with higher agreement ratings, consistent with psychophysical scaling effects. Among the tested acoustic features, pitch exerted a stronger influence than amplitude on perceived congruence. These findings demonstrate that modulation of pitch and amplitude is critical for achieving perceptually coherent auditory tactile mappings in robotic pain simulation. The proposed framework supports the development of high fidelity robotic patient simulators and provides a platform for studying multidimensional representations of pain in embodied robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Palpation Alters Auditory Pain Expressions with Gender-Specific Variations in Robopatients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable mortality, particularly in resource limited settings. Medical training simulators, including robopatients, help reduce such errors by replicating patient responses during procedures such as abdominal palpation. However, generating realistic multimodal feedback especially auditory pain expressions remains challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between applied palpation forces and perceived pain sounds. The high dimensionality and perceptual variability of pain vocalizations further limit conventional modeling approaches. We propose a novel experimental paradigm for adaptive pain expressivity in robopatients that dynamically generates auditory pain responses to palpation forces using human in the loop machine learning. Specifically, we employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm suited for continuous control, to iteratively refine pain sound generation based on real time human evaluative feedback. The system initializes randomized mappings between force inputs and sound outputs, and the learning agent progressively adjusts them to align with human perceptual preferences. Results show that the framework adapts to individual palpation behaviors and subjective sound preferences while capturing a broad range of perceived pain intensities, from mild discomfort to acute distress. We also observe perceptual saturation at lower force ranges, with gender specific thresholds in pain sound perception. This work demonstrates the feasibility of human in the loop reinforcement learning for co-optimizing haptic input and auditory pain expression in medical simulators, highlighting the potential of adaptive and immersive platforms to enhance palpation training and reduce diagnostic errors.</description>

      <title>Robust Convex Model Predictive Control with collision avoidance guarantees for robot manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments, making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances. There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.</description>

      <title>PA-MPPI: Perception-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral Control for Quadrotor Navigation in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving this problem requires addressing three key challenges: path planning in non-convex free space due to obstacles, satisfying quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and exploring unknown regions to expand the map. Recently, the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution to the first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs such as energy consumption. However, MPPI has been limited to tracking control that optimizes trajectories only within a small neighborhood around a reference trajectory, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions and plan alternative paths when blocked by large obstacles. To address this limitation, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI (PA-MPPI). In this approach, perception-awareness is characterized by planning and adapting the trajectory online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded, PA-MPPI incorporates a perception cost that biases trajectories toward those that can observe unknown regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz, performs on par with the state-of-the-art quadrotor navigation planner for unknown environments in challenging test scenarios. Furthermore, we show that PA-MPPI can serve as a safe and robust action policy for navigation foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly reachable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences, stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups. Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.</description>

      <title>Learning to Feel the Future: DreamTacVLA for Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.</description>

      <title>MeCo: Enhancing LLM-Empowered Multi-Robot Collaboration via Similar Task Memoization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-robot systems have been widely deployed in real-world applications, providing significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in labor costs. However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.Code and videos: https://lift-humanoid.github.io</description>

      <title>KAN We Flow? Advancing Robotic Manipulation with 3D Flow Matching via KAN &amp; RWKV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies excel at modeling action distributions but are inference-inefficient, since recursively denoising from noise to policy requires many steps and heavy UNet backbones, which hinders deployment on resource-constrained robots. Flow matching alleviates the sampling burden by learning a one-step vector field, yet prior implementations still inherit large UNet-style architectures. In this work, we present KAN-We-Flow, a flow-matching policy that draws on recent advances in Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) from vision to build a lightweight and highly expressive backbone for 3D manipulation. Concretely, we introduce an RWKV-KAN block: an RWKV first performs efficient time/channel mixing to propagate task context, and a subsequent GroupKAN layer applies learnable spline-based, groupwise functional mappings to perform feature-wise nonlinear calibration of the action mapping on RWKV outputs. Moreover, we introduce an Action Consistency Regularization (ACR), a lightweight auxiliary loss that enforces alignment between predicted action trajectories and expert demonstrations via Euler extrapolation, providing additional supervision to stabilize training and improve policy precision. Without resorting to large UNets, our design reduces parameters by 86.8\%, maintains fast runtime, and achieves state-of-the-art success rates on Adroit, Meta-World, and DexArt benchmarks.

      <title>SteerVLA: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models in Long-Tail Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in autonomous driving is the integration of high-level, semantic reasoning for long-tail events with low-level, reactive control for robust driving. While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

      <title>Effective Task Planning with Missing Objects using Learning-Informed Object Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.</description>

      <title>Hallucinating 360{\deg}: Panoramic Street-View Generation via Local Scenes Diffusion and Probabilistic Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot leverage stitched pinhole images as a supervisory signal. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/FeiT-FeiTeng/Percep360.</description>

      <title>Sim2real Image Translation Enables Viewpoint-Robust Policies from Fixed-Camera Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this setting, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. In certain real-world tabletop manipulation tasks, MANGO augmentation increases shifted-view success rates by over 40 percentage points compared to policies trained without augmentation.</description>

      <title>Transforming Policy-Car Swerving for Mitigating Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Practice-Oriented Jam-Absorption Driving Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves, as a major form of freeway traffic congestion, cause severe and long-lasting adverse effects, including reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. Amongst the highway traffic management strategies, jam-absorption driving (JAD), in which a dedicated vehicle performs "slow-in" and "fast-out" maneuvers before being captured by a stop-and-go wave, has been proposed as a potential method for preventing the propagation of such waves. However, most existing JAD strategies remain impractical mainly due to the lack of discussion regarding implementation vehicles and operational conditions. Inspired by real-world observations of police-car swerving behavior, this paper first introduces a Single-Vehicle Two-Detector Jam-Absorption Driving (SVDD-JAD) problem, and then proposes a practical JAD strategy that transforms such behavior into a maneuver capable of suppressing the propagation of an isolated stop-and-go wave. Five key parameters that significantly affect the proposed strategy, namely, JAD speed, inflow traffic speed, wave width, wave speed, and in-wave speed, are identified and systematically analyzed. Using a SUMO-based simulation as an illustrative example, we further demonstrate how these parameters can be measured in practice with two stationary roadside traffic detectors. The results show that the proposed JAD strategy successfully suppresses the propagation of a stop-and-go wave, without triggering a secondary wave. This paper is expected to take a significant step toward making JAD practical, advancing it from a theoretical concept to a feasible and implementable strategy. To promote reproducibility in the transportation domain, we have also open-sourced all the code on our GitHub repository https://github.com/gotrafficgo.</description>

      <title>Assessing Vision-Language Models for Perception in Autonomous Underwater Robotic Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Robots (AURs) operate in challenging underwater environments, including low visibility and harsh water conditions. Such conditions present challenges for software engineers developing perception modules for the AUR software. To successfully carry out these tasks, deep learning has been incorporated into the AUR software to support its operations. However, the unique challenges of underwater environments pose difficulties for deep learning models, which often rely on labeled data that is scarce and noisy. This may undermine the trustworthiness of AUR software that relies on perception modules. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for AUR software as they generalize to unseen objects and remain robust in noisy conditions by inferring information from contextual cues. Despite this potential, their performance and uncertainty in underwater environments remain understudied from a software engineering perspective. Motivated by the needs of an industrial partner in assurance and risk management for maritime systems to assess the potential use of VLMs in this context, we present an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules within the AUR software. We assess their ability to detect underwater trash by computing performance, uncertainty, and their relationship, to enable software engineers to select appropriate VLMs for their AUR software.</description>
