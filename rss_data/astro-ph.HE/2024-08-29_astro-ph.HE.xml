      <title>Investigating cannibalistic millisecond pulsar binaries using MESA: new constraints from pulsar spin and mass evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs), with orbital periods $\lesssim1$d, are key to understanding binary evolution involving massive neutron stars (NSs). Due to ablation of the companion by the rapidly spinning pulsar, these systems are also known as spiders, categorized into two main branches: redbacks (RBs; companion mass in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 M$_{\odot}$) and black widows (BWs; companion mass $\lesssim$ 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). We present models of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) and compare them with observations of Galactic spiders (including the presence/absence of hydrogen lines in their optical spectra). We constrain and quantify the interaction between pulsar and companion. Using MESA, we create the allowed initial parameter space, modeling the irradiation of the companion by the pulsar wind. For the first time in MESA, we include the detailed evolution of the pulsar spin. Efficient mass accretion onto the NS ($70\%$ of mass transferred) with an X-ray irradiated disc, followed by strong irradiation of the companion can explain most properties of the observed spiders. Our RBs continue to the BW regime, connecting the two branches of spiders. Our models explain the lack of hydrogen in some observed BWs with ultra-light companions. The mass required to spin-up a NS to sub-milliseconds is high enough to collapse it into a black hole. Finally, we discuss the formation of RB-like spiders with giant companions and orbital periods of several days (huntsmen) showing that they are unlikely to produce super-massive NSs (maximum accreted mass $\lesssim$0.5 M$_{\odot}$). Cannibalistic MSP binary formation depends heavily on the interplay between accretion onto the pulsar and pulsar wind irradiation. Our work supports earlier claims that RBs evolve into BWs. We also show that the fastest-spinning pulsars may collapse before reaching sub-millisecond spin periods.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variables and AM CVn Binaries in SRG/eROSITA + Gaia: Volume Limited Samples, X-ray Luminosity Functions, and Space Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present volume-limited samples of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and AM CVn binaries jointly selected from SRG/eROSITA eRASS1 and \textit{Gaia} DR3 using an X-ray + optical color-color diagram (the ``X-ray Main Sequence"). This tool identifies all CV subtypes, including magnetic and low-accretion rate systems, in contrast to most previous surveys. We find 23 CVs, 3 of which are AM CVns, out to 150 pc in the Western Galactic Hemisphere. Our 150 pc sample is spectroscopically verified and complete down to $L_X = 1.3\times 10^{29} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.2--2.3 keV band, and we also present CV candidates out to 300 pc and 1000 pc. We discovered two previously unknown systems in our 150 pc sample: the third nearest AM CVn and a magnetic period bouncer. We find the mean $L_X$ of CVs to be $\langle L_X \rangle \approx 4.6\times 10^{30} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, in contrast to previous surveys which yielded $\langle L_X \rangle \sim 10^{31}-10^{32} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We construct X-ray luminosity functions that, for the first time, flatten out at $L_X\sim 10^{30} \; \textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We find average number, mass, and luminosity densities of $\rho_\textrm{N, CV} = (3.7 \pm 0.7) \times 10^{-6} \textrm{pc}^{-3}$, $\rho_M = (5.0 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$, and $\rho_{L_X} = (2.3 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{26} \textrm{erg s}^{-1}M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, in the solar neighborhood. Our uniform selection method also allows us to place meaningful estimates on the space density of AM CVns, $\rho_\textrm{N, AM CVn} = (5.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-7} \textrm{pc}^{-3}$. Magnetic CVs and period bouncers make up $35\%$ and $25\%$ of our sample, respectively. This work, through a novel discovery technique, shows that the observed number densities of CVs and AM CVns, as well as the fraction of period bouncers, are still in tension with population synthesis estimates.</description>

      <title>The Remarkable X-ray Spectra and Variability of the Ultraluminous Weak-Line Quasar SDSS J1521+5202</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a focused X-ray and multiwavelength study of the ultraluminous weak-line quasar (WLQ) SDSS J1521+5202, one of the few X-ray weak WLQs that is amenable to basic X-ray spectral and variability investigations. J1521+5202 shows striking X-ray variability during 2006--2023, by up to a factor of $\approx 32$ in 0.5--2 keV flux, and our new 2023 Chandra observation caught it in its brightest X-ray flux state to date. Concurrent infrared/optical observations show only mild variability. The 2023 Chandra spectrum can be acceptably described by a power law with intrinsic X-ray absorption, and it reveals a nominal intrinsic level of X-ray emission relative to its optical/ultraviolet emission. In contrast, an earlier Chandra spectrum from 2013 shows apparent spectral complexity that is not well fit by a variety of models, including ionized-absorption or standard Compton-reflection models. Overall, the observations are consistent with the thick-disk plus outflow model previously advanced for WLQs, where a nominal level of underlying X-ray emission plus variable absorption lead to the remarkable observed X-ray variability. In the case of J1521+5202 it appears likely that the outflow, and not the thick disk itself, lies along our line-of-sight and causes the X-ray absorption.</description>

      <title>Electron Acceleration at Quasi-parallel Non-relativistic Shocks: A 1D Kinetic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a survey of 1D kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-parallel non-relativistic shocks to identify the environments favorable for electron acceleration. We explore an unprecedented range of shock speeds $v_{\rm sh}\approx 0.067-0.267\,c$, Alfv\'{e}n Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A} = 5-40$, sonic Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}_{\rm s} = 5-160$, as well as the proton-to-electron mass ratios $m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm e}=16-1836$. We find that high Alfv\'{e}n Mach number shocks can channel a large fraction of their kinetic energy into nonthermal particles, self-sustaining magnetic turbulence and acceleration to larger and larger energies. The fraction of injected particles is $\lesssim 0.5\%$ for electrons and $\approx 1\%$ for protons, and the corresponding energy efficiencies are $\lesssim 2\%$ and $\approx 10\%$, respectively. The extent of the nonthermal tail is sensitive to the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number; when $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A}\lesssim 10$, the nonthermal electron distribution exhibits minimal growth beyond the average momentum of the downstream thermal protons, independently of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Acceleration is slow for shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, yet nonthermal electrons still achieve momenta exceeding the downstream thermal proton momentum when the shock Alfv\'{e}n Mach number is large enough. We provide simulation-based parametrizations of the transition from thermal to nonthermal distribution in the downstream (found at a momentum around $p_{\rm i,e}/m_{\rm i}v_{\rm sh} \approx 3\sqrt{m_{\rm i,e}/m_{\rm i}}$), as well as the ratio of nonthermal electron to proton number density. The results are applicable to many different environments and are important for modeling shock-powered nonthermal radiation.</description>

      <title>Premerger phenomena in neutron-star binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRAND (the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) is a proposed next-generation observatory of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays of cosmic origin, with energies exceeding about 100 PeV. GRAND is envisioned as a collection of large-scale ground arrays of self-triggered radio antennas that target the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by UHE particles. Three prototype arrays are in operation: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. They test the detection principle and technology of GRAND, in preparation for its next phase, consisting of two arrays of 10'000 antennas each, in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, to be deployed from 2030 on. We present the concept of GRAND, its science goals, the status of the prototypes, their first measurements, and the technical and scientific perspectives that these measurements open for the field.</description>

      <title>A multi-dimensional view of a unified model for TDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can generate non-spherical, relativistic and optically thick outflows. Simulations show that the radiation we observe is reprocessed by these outflows. According to a unified model suggested by these simulations, the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of TDEs depend strongly on viewing angle: low [high] optical-to-X-ray ratios (OXRs) correspond to face-on [edge-on] orientations. Post-processing with radiative transfer codes have simulated the emergent spectra, but have so far been carried out only in a quasi-1D framework, with three atomic species (H, He and O). Here, we present 2.5D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations which model the emission from a non-spherical outflow, including a more comprehensive set of cosmically abundant species. While the basic trend of OXR increasing with inclination is preserved, the inherently multi-dimensional nature of photon transport through the non-spherical outflow significantly affects the emergent SEDs. Relaxing the quasi-1D approximation allows photons to preferentially escape in (polar) directions of lower optical depth, resulting in a greater variation of bolometric luminosity as a function of inclination. According to our simulations, inclination alone may not fully explain the large dynamic range of observed TDE OXRs. We also find that including metals, other than Oxygen, changes the emergent spectra significantly, resulting in stronger absorption and emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet, as well a greater variation in the OXR as a function of inclination. Whilst our results support previously proposed unified models for TDEs, they also highlight the critical importance of multi-dimensional ionization and radiative transfer.</description>

      <title>The Primary Flare Following a Stellar Collision in a Galactic Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions near supermassive black holes may result in a complete disruption of the stars. The initial disruption can have energies on par with supernovae and power a very fast transient. In this work we examine the primary flare that will follow the initial transient, which arises when streams of gas from the disrupted stars travel around the central black hole and collide with each other on the antipodal side with respect to the original collision. We present a simple analytic estimate for the properties of the flare, which depends on the distance of the collision from the central black hole and on the center of mass velocity of the colliding stars. We also present first of their kind radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of a few examples of stellar collisions and post-collision flow of the ejected gas, and calculate the expected bolometric light curves. We find that such post-collision flares are expected to be similar to flares which arise in tidal disruptions events of single stars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Low-Frequency Eclipses in Spider MSPs using wideband GMRT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipses of radio emission have been reported for ~ 58 spider millisecond pulsars (MSP), of which only around 19% have been extensively studied. Such studies at low frequencies are crucial for probing the properties of the eclipse medium, as eclipses are more prominent at such frequencies. This study investigates eclipses in 10 MSPs in compact orbit using wide-bandwidth observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. We report the first evidence of eclipsing for PSR J2234+0944 and J2214+3000 in one epoch, while no evidence of eclipsing was observed in the subsequent two epochs, indicating temporal evolution of the eclipse cutoff frequency in these systems. Constraints on the eclipse cutoff frequency were obtained for PSR J1555-2908, J1810+1744, and J2051-0827. Moreover, for the first time, we detected an eclipse at a non-standard orbital phase (~ 0.5) for PSR J1810+1744, with a duration longer than the eclipse observed at superior conjunction. No eclipses were detected for PSR J0751+1807, J1738+0333, and J1807-2459A at 300-500 MHz and 550-750 MHz, for which we discuss the possible reasons. We calculated the mass loss rates of the companions for PSR J1555-2908 and PSR J1810+1744, and found that these rates are insufficient to ablate the companion stars. We cataloged the $\dot{E}/a^2$, mass function, roche lobe filling factor, and inclination angle for compact MSP binaries with low-mass companions and found that higher spin-down flux does not guarantee eclipses. Our analysis, supported by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, reveals that eclipsing black widow binaries generally exhibit a higher mass function compared to non-eclipsing black widow binaries, as reported by previous studies for a limited sample of black widow MSPs.</description>

      <title>Tight bound on neutron-star radius with quasiperiodic oscillations in short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) have been recently discovered in the short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 910711 and 931101B. Their frequencies are consistent with those of the radial and quadrupolar oscillations of binary neutron star merger remnants, as obtained in numerical relativity simulations. These simulations reveal quasiuniversal relations between the remnant oscillation frequencies and the tidal coupling constant of the binaries. Under the assumption that the observed QPOs are due to these postmerger oscillations, we use the frequency-tide relations in a Bayesian framework to infer the source redshift, as well as the chirp mass and the binary tidal deformability of the binary neutron star progenitors for GRBs 910711 and 931101B. We further use this inference to estimate bounds on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. By combining the estimates from the two GRBs, we find a 68\% credible range $R_{1.4}=12.48^{+0.41}_{-0.41}$~km for the radius of a neutron star with mass $M=1.4$~M$_\odot$, which is one of the tightest bounds to date.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution of neutron stars in transient low-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsar + helium white dwarf (MSP+He WD) binaries are thought to have descended from neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The NSs accreted from the progenitors of the WDs and their spin periods were accordingly accelerated to the equilibrium periods of order milliseconds. Thus, the initial spin periods of the ``recycled" NSs are critically determined by the mass transfer rate in the LMXB phase. However, the standard picture neglects the possible spin-down of the NSs when the donor star decouples from its Roche lobe at the end of the mass transfer, as well as the transient behavior of most LMXBs. Both imply more complicated spin evolution during the recycling process. In this work, we perform detailed calculations of the formation of MSP+He WD binaries. We take into account three magnetic braking (MB) prescriptions proposed in the literature, and examine the effects of both persistent and transient accretion. We find that the spin periods are not sensitively dependent on the efficiency of MB, but are considerably influenced by the accretion mode. In comparison with persistent accretion, transient accretion leads to shorter and longer spin periods of the NSs in narrow and wide systems, respectively. This may help account for the measured spin periods of MSPs in wide binaries, which seem to be longer than predicted by the persistent accretion model.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with dark matter: equiparticle model in a two fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the possible scenario of strange stars admixed with fermionic or bosonic dark matter. For the description of the ``visible'' sector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account in-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density dependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the stellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per baryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the predictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former we consider a spin $1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both models present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the bosonic model since it helps avoiding the collapse of the star due to the lack of the degeneracy pressure. Our results point out to possible stable strange stars configurations in agreement with data from PSR~J0030+0451, PSR~J0740+6620, NICER and HESS~J1731-347. As another feature, we find stars with dark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.</description>

      <title>Wind from the Hot Accretion Flow and Super-Eddington Accretion Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind is believed to be widespread in various black hole accretion flows. However, unlike the wind from thin disks, which have substantial observational evidence, the wind from hot accretion flows is difficult to observe due to the extremely high temperatures causing the gas to be almost fully ionized. Its existence was controversial until recent theoretical work demonstrated its presence and strength, which was subsequently confirmed by observations. Although there have been some new observations recently, the main progress still comes from theoretical studies. These studies investigate the effects of different magnetic fields and black hole spins on the wind, providing insights into properties such as mass flux and wind velocity. Wind is typically produced locally within the Bondi radius, and even wind generated on a small scale can propagate far beyond this radius. The situation with super-Eddington wind is similar, despite some recent observations, the main advances rely on theoretical studies. Recent research comparing the momentum and energy of wind and jets suggests that wind plays a more crucial role in active galactic nuclei feedback than jets, whether the wind originates from hot accretion flows or super-Eddington accretion flows.</description>

      <title>Rocking the BOAT: the ups and downs of the long-term radio light curve for GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radio observations of the long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A which has become known to the community as the Brightest Of All Time or the BOAT. Our observations span the first 475 days post-burst and three orders of magnitude in observing frequency, from 0.15 to 230GHz. By combining our new observations with those available in the literature, we have the most detailed radio data set in terms of cadence and spectral coverage of any GRB to date, which we use to explore the spectral and temporal evolution of the afterglow. By testing a series of phenomenological models, we find that three separate synchrotron components best explain the afterglow. The high temporal and spectral resolution allows us to conclude that standard analytical afterglow models are unable to explain the observed evolution of GRB 221009A. We explore where the discrepancies between the observations and the models are most significant and place our findings in the context of the most well-studied GRB radio afterglows to date. Our observations are best explained by three synchrotron emitting regions which we interpret as a forward shock, a reverse shock and an additional shock potentially from a cocoon or wider outflow. Finally, we find that our observations do not show any evidence of any late-time spectral or temporal changes that could result from a jet break but note that any lateral structure could significantly affect a jet break signature.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectropolarimetry of the bright atoll Serpens X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simultaneous X-ray polarimetric and spectral observations of the bright atoll source Ser~X-1 carried out with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), NICER, and NuSTAR. We obtain an upper limit of 2% (99% confidence level) on the polarization degree in the 2--8 keV energy band. We detect four type-I X-ray bursts, two of which during the IXPE observation. This is the first time that has IXPE observed type-I X-ray bursts, and it allows us to place an upper limit on their polarization degree; however, due to the limited total number of counts in each burst, we obtain a relatively high upper limit (80%). We confirm the presence of reflection features in the X-ray spectrum, notably a broad iron line. Fitting the data with a relativistic reflection model, we derive a disk inclination of 25 deg. The spectral and polarization properties are comparable with other atolls observed by IXPE, suggesting a similar accretion geometry, and the relatively low polarization is consistent with the low inclination.</description>

      <title>Non-detection of Neutrinos from the BOAT: Improved Constraints on the Parameters of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino observatory detects the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background with high significance, but the contribution of different classes of sources is not established. Because of their non-thermal spectrum, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are prime particle acceleration sites and one of the candidate classes for significant neutrino production. Exhaustive searches, based on stacking analysis of GRBs however could not establish the link between neutrinos and GRBs. Gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A had the highest time integrated gamma-ray flux of any detected GRB so far. The total fluence exceeds the sum of all Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) detected GRBs by a factor of two. Because it happened relatively nearby, it is one of the most favorable events for neutrino production from GRBs yet no neutrinos were detected. We calculate neutrino fluxes for this GRB in the TeV-PeV range using the most accurate, time-resolved spectral data covering the brightest intervals. We place limits on the physical parameters (Lorentz factor, baryon loading or emission radius) of the burst that are better by a factor of 2 compared to previous limits. The neutrino non-detection indicates a bulk Lorentz factor greater than 500 and possibly even 1000, consistent with other observations.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $10^7$ K hot emitting gas in the Circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of the $\approx 10^6$ K gas in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way has been well established. However, the location and the origin of the newly discovered hot gas at `super-virial' temperatures of $\approx 10^7$ K have been puzzling. This hot gas has been detected in both absorption and emission; here we focus on the emitting gas only. We show that both the `virial' and the `super-virial' temperature gas as observed in \emph{emission} occupy disk-like extraplanar regions, in addition to the diffuse virial temperature gas filling the halo of the Milky Way. We perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations to show that the $\approx 10^7$ K emitting gas is likely to be produced by stellar feedback in and around the Galactic disk. We further show that the emitting gas at both super-virial and virial temperatures in the extraplanar regions is metal enriched and is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo but is continuously evolving.</description>

      <title>Forward Ray Tracing and Hot Spots in Kerr Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hotspots, often characterized as point-like emissions, frequently manifest near black holes, displaying significantly increased luminosity compared to the surrounding accretion flow. It is noteworthy that these hotspots regularly occur outside the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Light rays emitted from these sources follow complex trajectories around the black hole, ultimately arriving at distinct locations on the observer's image plane. To extract precise spacetime information, including the black hole mass, spin, and inclination angle, it is crucial to accurately resolve both the direct emission and its higher-order images, despite the latter's intensity suppression. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of modeling and analyzing these hotspots, we introduce a forward ray tracing method, a departure from the traditional backward ray tracing approach. By utilizing conserved quantities in Kerr spacetime, this method initiates geodesics from a specified emission point near the black hole and terminates them at a distant observer, effectively capturing multiple images. By introducing perturbations to these geodesics, we map finite-size emissions to distinct regions on the image plane, allowing for the quantification of image shapes and amplification rates. This approach facilitates efficient spacetime tomography and hotspot localization, leveraging observations from the Event Horizon Telescope and its next-generation upgrades.</description>

      <title>Boson Cloud Atlas: Direct Observation of Superradiance Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars emerge naturally in several motivated particle physics scenarios and are viable candidates for dark matter. While laboratory detection of such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on measurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the two spin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass around the BH at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few percent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tidal Spin-up of Subdwarf B Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are stripped helium-burning stars that are often found in close binaries, where they experience strong tidal interactions. The dissipation of tidally excited gravity waves alter their rotational evolution throughout the sdB lifetime. While many sdB binaries have well-measured rotational and orbital frequencies, there have been few theoretical efforts to accurately calculate the tidal torque produced by gravity waves. In this work, we directly calculate the tidal excitation of internal gravity waves in realistic sdB stellar models, and integrate the coupled spin-orbit evolution of sdB binaries. We find that for canonical sdB ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.47\,M_\odot$) binaries, the transitional orbital period below which they could reach tidal synchronization in the sdB lifetime is $\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$, with weak dependence on the companion masses. For low-mass sdBs ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.37\,M_\odot$) formed from more massive progenitor stars, the transitional orbital period becomes $\sim \! 0.15\;\mathrm{days}$. These values are very similar to the tidal synchronization boundary ($\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$) evident from observations. We discuss the dependence of tidal torques on stellar radii, and we make predictions for the rapidly rotating white dwarfs formed from synchronized sdB binaries.</description>

      <title>Assessing the capability of a model-based stellar XUV estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar XUV (X-ray and extreme ultraviolet) emission drives the heating and chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary disks, and therefore, a proper estimation of a stellar XUV spectrum is required for their studies. One proposed solution is to estimate stellar atmospheric heating using numerical models, although the validation was restricted to the Sun over a limited parameter range. In this study, we extend the validation of the model by testing it with the Sun and three young, nearby solar-type stars with available XUV observational data. We first test the model with the solar observations, examining its accuracy in activity minimum and maximum phases, its dependence on loop length, the effect of loop length superposition, and its sensitivity to elemental abundance. We confirm that the model spectrum is mostly accurate both in activity minimum and maximum, although the high-energy X-rays (&lt; 1 nm) are underestimated in the activity maximum. Applying the model to young solar-type stars, we find that it can reproduce the observed XUV spectra within a factor of 3 in the range of 1-30 nm for stars with magnetic flux up to 100 times that of the Sun. For a star with 300 times the solar magnetic flux, although the raw numerical data show a systematically lower spectrum than observed, the spectra are in good agreement once corrected for the effect of insufficient resolution in the transition region. For all young solar-type stars, high-energy X-rays (&lt; 1 nm) are significantly underestimated, with the deviation increasing with stellar magnetic activity. Our findings indicate that the stellar XUV spectrum can be reasonably estimated through a numerical model, given that the essential input parameters (surface magnetic flux and elemental abundance) are known.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Mass Loss in Binary Stars. V. Effects of Metallicity and Nonconservative Mass Transfer -- Application in High Mass X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are responsible for many unusual astrophysical phenomena, including some important explosive cosmic events. The stability criteria for rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental to binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of systems such as X-ray binaries and merging gravitational-wave sources. We use our adiabatic mass-loss model to systematically survey metal-poor and solar-metallicity donor thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer. The critical mass ratios qad are systematically explored, and the impact of metallicity and nonconservative mass transfer are studied. For metal-poor radiative-envelope donors, qad are smaller than those for solar-metallicity stars at the same evolutionary stage. However, qad do the opposite for convective-envelope donors. Nonconservative mass transfer significantly decreases qad for massive donors. This is because it matters how conservative mass transfer is during the thermal timescale phase immediately preceding a delayed dynamical mass transfer. We apply our theoretical predictions to observed high-mass X-ray binaries that have overfilled their Roche lobes and find a good agreement with their mass ratios. Our results can be applied to study individual binary objects or large samples of binary objects with binary population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>Irradiation-driven mass transfer for massive companion stars in supersoft X-rays sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) have been proposed as one of the progenitors for Type Ia supernovae. However, the exact origin of the quasi-periodic variability in the optical light curve remains a mystery.In this work, our goal is to investigate the effect of the feedback of an evolved main-sequence companion star on X-ray irradiation and find whether periodic X-ray irradiation of the companion star could reproduce periodic mass transfer.Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, we modeled the evolutionary track of the companion star under the influence of supersoft X-ray irradiation, and we calculated the resulting mass transfer rate. We find that the supersoft X-ray heating of the companion star can result in the expansion of the companion, causing it to greatly overflow its Roche lobe and thereby increasing the mass transfer rate. The periodic X-ray irradiation on the companion stars leads to periodic changes in the mass transfer rate. For a given companion star, higher irradiation efficiencies result in a higher mass transfer rate. Additionally, the mass transfer rate increases as the mass of the companion star decreases for a given irradiation efficiency. The companion star undergoing thermal timescale mass transfer is periodically irradiated by the X-rays from the WD, which can lead to periodic enhancement of the mass transfer rate. The mechanism could be the origin of the quasi-periodic optical light curve in supersoft X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Boundary Layers of Circumplanetary Disks around Spinning Planets II. Global Modes with Azimuthal Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accretion of material from disks onto weakly magnetized objects invariably involves its traversal through a material surface, known as the boundary layer (BL). Our prior studies have revealed two distinct global wave modes for circumplanetary disks (CPDs) with BLs exhibit opposite behaviors in spin modulation.We perform a detailed analysis about the effect of magnetic fields on these global modes, highlighting how magnetic resonances and turning points could complicate the wave dynamics. The angular momentum flux becomes positive near the BL with increasing magnetic field strength. We also examine the perturbation profile to demonstrate the amplification of magnetic fields within the BL. The dependence of growth rates on the magnetic field strength, and the spin rate are systematically investigated. We find that stronger magnetic fields tend to result in lower terminal spin rates. We stress the potential possibility for the formation of angular momentum belts and pressure bumps. The implication for the spin evolution and quasi-period oscillations observed in compact objects are also briefly discussed. Our calculations advance the understanding of magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) accretion processes and lays a foundation for observational studies and numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.</description>

      <title>How can an extra dimension affect compact star observables in the Klauza-Klein model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical framework for calculating the mass-radius curve of compact stars in the Kaluza-Klein space-time is introduced, with one additional compact spatial dimension. Static, spherically symmetric solutions are considered, with the equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting multidimensional Fermi gas. To model the strong force between baryons, a repulsive potential is introduced, which is linear in the particle number density. The maximal mass of compact stars is calculated for different model parameters, and with a physical parameter choice, it satisfies observational data, meaning that it is possible to model simple, realistic objects within this framework. Based on this comparison, a limiting size for the observational regime of extra dimensions in compact stars is provided, with $r_c \gtrsim 0.2$~fm.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the minimum sound speed above neutron star densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of massive neutron stars and asymptotic freedom of QCD place robust upper bounds on the lowest sound speed of the ultra-dense matter unattainable in neutron stars. Our approach does not rely on explicitly representing the equation of state in the density range $\sim 2-40 n_0$, and does not require probabilistic interpretations. The upper limit decreases rapidly when the maximum mass of neutron stars is greater than about $2.5M_\odot$. Discovery of $\sim 3 M_\odot$ neutron stars would strongly support first-order phase transitions at high baryon densities</description>

      <title>Post-innermost stable circular orbit ringdown of a rapidly spinning black hole: mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasi-normal mode excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a binary merger with a small mass ratio, as the secondary body approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the primary black hole, the motion transitions from the adiabatic inspiral to the plunge governed by the geodesic equation. The plunge orbit is expected to excite the ringdown gravitational wave, which encodes information about the primary black hole's geometry. The details of the transition regime depend on the binary's mass ratio through radiation fluxes, which in turn influence the initial conditions for the plunge. As such, the mass ratio affects the post-ISCO ringdown gravitational wave excitation. In this study, we numerically investigate the mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasi-normal mode excitations in the post-ISCO gravitational waves of rapidly spinning black holes, based on the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. We consider the effect of mass ratio on the gravitational waves by accounting for the energy and angular momentum losses during the transition regime following the Ori-Thorne procedure. We examine two mass ratio scenarios: the intermediate mass ratio (IMR) and the extreme mass ratio (EMR). Our main finding is that higher harmonic quasi-normal modes are significantly excited in an IMR merger involving a highly spinning primary black hole. This implies that detecting an IMR merger involving such a primary black hole with space-based gravitational wave interferometers can provide valuable opportunities to infer black hole properties or test general relativity with excellent precision.</description>

      <title>A new formulation of strong-field magnetohydrodynamics for neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Chandra X-ray Observatory Observations of 13 Fermi LAT Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the latest data release from the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope (the 4th Fermi LAT 14 yr Catalog, or 4FGL), more than 50% of the Galactic sources are yet to be identified. We observed 13 unidentified Fermi LAT sources with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to explore their nature. We report the results of the classification of X-ray sources in the fields of these $\gamma$-ray sources and discuss the implications for their nature. We use multiwavelength (MW) data for a machine-learning classification, accompanied by a more detailed spectral/variability analysis for brighter sources. Eight 4FGL sources have $\gamma$-ray pulsars within their position error ellipses. We consider three of these pulsars (PSR J1906+0722, PSR J1105-6037, and PSR J1358-6025) to be detected in X-rays, while PSR J1203-6242 shows a hint of X-ray emission. Within the positional uncertainties of three of the 4FGL sources, we detect X-ray sources that may be yet unknown pulsars, depending on the MW association. In addition to point sources, we discovered two extended sources, one of which is likely to be a bow-shock pulsar-wind nebula associated with PSR J1358-6025. Finally, we classify other X-ray sources detected in these observations and report the most interesting classifications.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Frequency View of the Radio Phoenix in the Abell 85 Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio phoenices are complex and filamentary diffuse radio sources found in both merging and relaxed clusters. The formation of these sources was proposed to be due to adiabatic compression of old Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) plasma in shock waves. Most of the previous spectral studies of these sources were limited to integrated spectral indices, which were found to be very steep as well as showing a curved spectrum. Here, we have performed a multi-frequency investigation of the radio phoenix in the Abell 85 cluster. Owing to the sensitive high-resolution observations, we found some of the finer filamentary structures that were previously undetected. We produced resolved spectral index maps of the radio phoenix between 323, 700, and 1280 MHz. The orientation of the filaments, as well as the gradient across the spectral index maps, suggest the possible direction of the shock motion from northeast to southwest. The integrated spectrum of the radio phoenix was found to be very steep and curved toward high-frequencies. Furthermore, the spectral index of the filaments was found to be less steep compared to the non-filamentary regions, implying greater energy injection in the filaments. The observed features in the radio phoenix in the Abell 85 cluster seem to be in support of the adiabatic shock compression mechanism.</description>

      <title>Constraining the hadronic properties of star-forming galaxies above $1\, \rm GeV$ with 15-years Fermi-LAT data</title>

Abstract: Star-forming and starburst galaxies (SFGs and SBGs) are powerful emitters of non-thermal $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos, due to their intense phases of star-formation activity, which should confine high-energy Cosmic-Rays (CRs) inside their environments. In this paper, using the publicly-available \texttt{fermitools}, we analyse 15.3 years of $\gamma$-ray between $1-1000\, \rm GeV$ data for 70 sources, 56 of which were not previously detected. We find at~$4\sigma$ level an indication of $\gamma$-ray emission for other two SBGs, namely M 83 and NGC 1365. By contrast, we find that, even with the new description of background, the significance for the $\gamma$-ray emission of M 33~(initially reported as discovered) still stands at $\sim \, 4\sigma$ (as already reported by previous works). Along with previous findings, the flux of each detected source is consistent with a $\sim E^{-2.3/2.4}$ spectrum, compatible with the injected CR flux inferred for CRs in the Milky-Way. We notice that the correlation between the calorimetric fraction~$F_{\rm cal}$ of high-energy protons in SFGs and SBGs (the fraction of high-energy protons actually producing high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos) and the SFR is in accordance with the expected scaling relation for CR escape dominated by advection. We remark that undiscovered sources strongly constrain $F_{\rm cal}$ at 95\% CL, providing fundamental information when we interpret the results as common properties of SFGs and SBGs. Finally, we find that these sources might contribute $(12\pm 3)\%$ to the EGB, while the corresponding diffuse neutrino flux strongly depends on the spectral index distribution along the source class.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Constraining the physical properties of large-scale jets from black hole X-ray binaries and their impact on the local environment with blast-wave dynamical models</title>

Abstract: Relativistic discrete ejecta launched by black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) can be observed to propagate up to parsec-scales from the central object. Observing the final deceleration phase of these jets is crucial to estimate their physical parameters and to reconstruct their full trajectory, with implications for the jet powering mechanism, composition and formation. In this paper we present the results of the modelling of the motion of the ejecta from three BH XRBs: MAXI J1820+070, MAXI J1535$-$571 and XTE J1752$-$223, for which high-resolution radio and X-ray observations of jets propagating up to $\sim$15 arcsec ($\sim$0.6 pc at 3 kpc) from the core have been published in the recent years. For each jet, we modeled its entire motion with a dynamical blast-wave model, inferring robust values for the jet Lorentz factor, inclination angle and ejection time. Under several assumptions associated to the ejection duration, the jet opening angle and the available accretion power, we are able to derive stringent constraints on the maximum jet kinetic energy for each source (between $10^{43}$ and $10^{44}$ erg, including also H1743$-$322), as well as placing interesting upper limits on the density of the ISM through which the jets are propagating (from $n_{\rm ISM} \lesssim 0.4$ cm$^{-3}$ down to $n_{\rm ISM} \lesssim 10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$). Overall, our results highlight the potential of applying models derived from gamma-ray bursts to the physics of jets from BH XRBs and support the emerging picture of these sources as preferentially embedded in low-density environments.</description>

      <title>Repeating nuclear transients from repeating partial tidal disruption events: reproducing ASASSN-14ko and AT2020vdq</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass ($\gtrsim 1 M_{\odot}$), evolved stars can survive many ($\gtrsim 10-100$) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing $few \times 0.01 M_{\odot}$, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko's flares, $\dot{P}\simeq-0.0026$. Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.</description>

      <title>No evidence for a dip in the binary black hole mass spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar models indicate that the core compactness of a star, which is a common proxy for its explodability in a supernova, does not increase monotonically with the star's mass. Rather, the core compactness dips sharply over a range of carbon-oxygen core masses; this range may be somewhat sensitive to the star's metallicity and evolutionary history. Stars in this compactness dip are expected to experience supernovae leaving behind neutron stars, whereas stars on either side of this range are expected to form black holes. This results in a hypothetical mass range in which black holes should seldom form. Quantitatively, when applied to binary stripped stars, these models predict a dearth of binary black holes with component masses $\approx 10 M_\odot - 15 M_\odot$. The population of gravitational-wave signals indicates potential evidence for a dip in the distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes near $\approx 10 M_\odot - 12 M_\odot$. This feature could be linked to the hypothetical component mass gap described above, but this interpretation depends on what assumptions are made of the binaries' mass ratios. Here, we directly probe the distribution of binary black hole component masses to look for evidence of a gap. We find no evidence for this feature using data from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3). If this gap does exist in nature, we find that it is unlikely to be resolvable by the end of the current (fourth) LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing run.</description>

      <title>Across the soft gamma-ray regime: utilizing simultaneous detections in the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) and the Background and Transient Observer (BTO) to understand astrophysical transients</title>

Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a NASA funded Small Explorer (SMEX) mission slated to launch in 2027. COSI will house a wide-field gamma-ray telescope designed to survey the entire sky in the 0.2--5 MeV range. Using germanium detectors, the instrument will provide imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of astrophysical sources with excellent energy resolution and degree-scale localization capabilities. In addition to the main instrument, COSI will fly with a student collaboration project known as the Background and Transient Observer (BTO). BTO will extend the COSI bandpass to energies lower than 200 keV, thus enabling spectral analysis across the shared band of 30 keV--2 MeV range. The BTO instrument will consist of two NaI scintillators and student-designed readout electronics. Using spectral information from both the COSI and BTO instruments, physics such as the energy peak turnover in gamma-ray bursts, the characteristics of magnetar flares, and the event frequency of a range of transient phenomena will be constrained. In this paper, we present the expected science returnables from BTO and comment on the shared returnables from the COSI and BTO missions. We include simulations of gamma-ray bursts, magnetar giant flares, and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes using BTO's spectral response. Additionally, we estimate BTO's gamma-ray burst detection rate and find that BTO will detect ~150 gamma-ray bursts per year, with most of these events being long bursts.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Optical identification and properties of galaxy clusters and groups in the western galactic hemisphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) provides the largest intracluster medium-selected galaxy cluster and group catalog covering the western galactic hemisphere. Compared to samples selected purely on X-ray extent, the sample purity can be enhanced by identifying cluster candidates using optical and near-infrared data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Using the red-sequence-based cluster finder eROMaPPer, we measured individual photometric properties (redshift $z_\lambda$, richness $\lambda$, optical center, and BCG position) for 12,000 eRASS1 clusters over a sky area of 13,116 deg$^2$, augmented by 247 cases identified by matching the candidates with known clusters from the literature. The median redshift of the identified eRASS1 sample is $z=0.31$, with 10% of the clusters at $z&gt;0.72$. The photometric redshifts have an accuracy of $\delta z/(1+z)&lt;0.005$ for $0.05&lt;z&lt;0.9$. Spectroscopic cluster properties (redshift $z_{\rm spec}$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma$) are measured a posteriori for a subsample of 3,210 and 1,499 eRASS1 clusters, respectively, using an extensive compilation of spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies from the literature. We infer that the primary eRASS1 sample has a purity of 86% and optical completeness &gt;95% for $z&gt;0.05$. For these and further quality assessments of the eRASS1 identified catalog, we applied our identification method to a collection of galaxy cluster catalogs in the literature, as well as blindly on the full Legacy Surveys covering 24,069 deg$^2$. Using a combination of these cluster samples, we investigated the velocity dispersion-richness relation, finding $\log(\lambda)=2.401\times\log(\sigma)-5.074$ with an intrinsic scatter of $0.10\pm0.01$ dex. Our main result is the identified eRASS1 cluster catalog with a high purity and a well-defined X-ray selection process, enabling precise cosmological analyses presented in companion papers.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>Inertial range of magnetorotational turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks around compact stars are formed due to turbulence driven by magnetorotational instability. Despite over thirty years of numerous computational studies on magnetorotational turbulence, the properties of fluctuations in the inertial range -- where cross-scale energy transfer dominates over energy injection -- have remained elusive, primarily due to insufficient numerical resolution. Here, we report the highest-resolution simulation of magnetorotational turbulence ever conducted. Our simulations reveal a constant cross-scale energy flux, a hallmark of the inertial range. We found that as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the inertial range, the kinetic and magnetic energies tend toward equipartitioning with the same spectral slope, and slow-magnetosonic fluctuations dominate over Alfv\'enic fluctuations, possessing twice the energy. These findings align remarkably with the theoretical expectations from the reduced magnetohydrodynamic model, which assumes a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field. Our results provide important implications for interpreting the radio observations by the Event Horizon Telescope.</description>
