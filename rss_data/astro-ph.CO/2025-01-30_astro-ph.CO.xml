      <title>HI Intensity Mapping with the MIGHTEE Survey: First Results of the HI Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results of the HI intensity mapping power spectrum analysis with the MeerKAT International GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey. We use data covering $\sim$ 4 square degrees in the COSMOS field using a frequency range 962.5 MHz to 1008.42 MHz, equivalent to HI emission in $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.48$. The data consists of 15 pointings with a total of 94.2 hours on-source. We verify the suitability of the MIGHTEE data for HI intensity mapping by testing for residual systematics across frequency, baselines and pointings. We also vary the window used for HI signal measurements and find no significant improvement using stringent Fourier mode cuts. Averaging in the power spectrum domain, i.e. using incoherent averaging, we calculate the first upper limits from MIGHTEE on the HI power spectrum at scales $0.5 Mpc^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10 Mpc^{-1}$. We obtain the best 1$\sigma$ upper limit of 28.6 mK$^{2}$Mpc${^3}$ on $k\sim$2 Mpc$^{-1}$. Our results are consistent with the power spectrum detected with observations in the DEEP2 field with MeerKAT. The data we use here constitutes a small fraction of the MIGHTEE survey and demonstrates that combined analysis of the full MIGHTEE survey can potentially detect the HI power spectrum at $z\lesssim0.5$ in the range $0.1 Mpc^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10 Mpc^{-1}$ or quasi-linear scales.</description>

      <title>Looking at infrared background radiation anisotropies with Spitzer: large scale anisotropies and their implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Spitzer/IRAC deep exposure data covering two significantly larger than before sky areas to construct maps suitable for evaluating source-subtracted fluctuations in the cosmic infrared background (CIB). The maps are constructed using the self-calibration methodology eliminating artifacts to sufficient accuracy and subset maps are selected in each area containing approximately uniform exposures. These maps are clipped and removed of known sources and then Fourier transformed to probe the CIB anisotropies to new larger scales. The power spectrum of the resultant CIB anisotropies is measured from the data to &gt;1 degree revealing the component well above that from remaining known galaxies on scales &gt;1 arcmin. The fluctuations are demonstrated to be free of Galactic and Solar System foreground contributions out to the largest scales measured. We discuss the proposed theories for the origin of the excess CIB anisotropies in light of the new data. Out of these, the model where the CIB fluctuation excess originates from the granulation power due to LIGO-observed primordial black holes as dark matter appears most successful in accounting for all observations related to the measured CIB power amplitude and spatial structure, including the measured coherence between the CIB and unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB). Finally we point out the use of the data to probe the CIB-CXB cross-power to new scales and higher accuracy. We also discuss the synergy of these data with future CIB programs at shorter near-IR wavelengths with deep wide surveys and sub-arcsecond angular resolution as provided by Euclid and Roman space missions.</description>

      <title>A universal bound on the duration of a kination era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that primordial adiabatic curvature fluctuations generate an instability of the scalar field sourcing a kination era. We demonstrate that the generated higher Fourier modes constitute a radiation-like component dominating over the kination background after about $11$ e-folds of cosmic expansion. Current constraints on the extra number of neutrino flavors $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ thus imply the observational bound of approximately 10 e-folds, representing the most stringent bound to date on the stiffness of the equation of state of the pre-Big-Bang-Nucleosynthesis universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Moduli and Non-perturbative Production of Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological moduli generically come to dominate the energy density of the early universe, and thereby trigger an early matter dominated era. Such non-standard cosmological histories are expected to have profound effects on the evolution and production of axion cold dark matter and dark radiation, as well as their prospects for detection. We consider moduli-axion couplings and investigate the early history of the coupled system, considering closely the evolution of the homogeneous modulus field, the back-reaction from the axion, and the energy densities of the two fields. A particular point of interest is the enhancement of axion production from modulus decay, due to tachyonic and parametric resonant instabilities, and the implications of such production on the cosmological moduli problem, axion dark radiation, and the available parameter space for axion dark matter. Using an effective field theory approach, WKB-based semi-analytical analysis, and detailed numerical estimates of the co-evolution of the system, we evaluate the expected decay efficiency of the modulus to axions. The effects of higher-order operators are studied and implications for UV-complete frameworks such as the Large Volume Scenarios in Type IIB string theory are considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Innermost Stable Circular Orbits of a Kerr-like Metric with Quadrupole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents results for the innermost stable circular orbit in a Kerr-like spacetime. The metric employed is an approximation that combines the Kerr metric with the Erez-Rosen metric, expanded in a Taylor series. Consequently, this spacetime incorporates three relativistic multipole moments: mass, spin, and quadrupole moment. Our derivation builds upon the analysis conducted by Chandrasekhar for the Kerr metric. Utilizing the Euler-Lagrange method and Hamiltonian dynamics, we define an effective potential for the radial coordinate. This equation can be used to measure the mass quadrupole through observational methods, as it yields a quadratic polynomial for the quadrupole moment. As anticipated, the limiting cases of this equation correspond to the established cases of Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of "snow clouds" by unassociated stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that star-forming galaxies may host a substantial, dark reservoir of gas in the form of planetary-mass molecular clouds that are so cold that $\text{H}_{2}$ can condense. Here we investigate the process of tidal disruption of such "snow clouds" by close passage of field stars. We construct a suite of simulations using the hydrodynamic formalism introduced by Carter and Luminet, and use it to explore the properties of the resulting tidal debris. The debris streams are tiny structures that are highly over-pressured relative to the ambient ISM. They are also unusual in their composition -- initially consisting of cold, gaseous He together with $\text{H}_{2}$ "snowballs" that may be as much as a metre in size. Each stream expands and cools and is subsequently shocked as it ploughs through the ISM; the snowballs are gradually eroded by the shocked gas. Snowballs streaming through the shocked ISM create microstructured plasma that is somewhat reminiscent of the "scattering screens" revealed by radio-wave scintillation studies. However, the tidal disruption rate is too low to account for the observed number of scattering screens if, as we assume here, the stars and clouds have no prior physical association so that disruptions occur as a result of chance encounters between stars and clouds.</description>

      <title>A Semi-analytic Framework of Population III and Subsequent Galaxy Formation on Ultralarge Cosmological N-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new semi-analytic framework of Population (Pop) III and subsequent galaxy formation designed to run on dark matter halo merger trees. In our framework, we consider the effect of the Lyman-Werner flux from Pop III and II stars and the dark matter baryon streaming velocity on the critical minihalo mass for the Pop III formation. Our model incorporates the Lyman-Werner feedback in a self-consistent way, therefore, the spatial variation of Lyman-Werner feedback naturally emerges. The Pop III mass depends on the properties of a minihalo as reproducing radiative hydrodynamical simulation results. We perform statistical studies of Pop III stars by applying this framework to high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with a maximum box size of 16 Mpc/h and enough mass resolution to resolve Pop III-forming minihalos. A top-heavy initial mass function emerges and two peaks corresponding to the H$_2$ ($20 \lesssim z \lesssim 25$) and atomic cooling halos ($z \lesssim 15$) exist in the distribution. Supermassive stars can be formed in the atomic cooling halos, and the fractions of such supermassive stars increase with the value of streaming velocity. At least an 8 Mpc/h simulation box and the self-consistent model for the Lyman-Werner feedback are necessary to correctly model the Pop III formation in the atomic cooling halos. Our model predicts one supermassive star per halo with several $10^9$ Msun at z=7.5, which is enough to reproduce a high redshift quasar.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic velocity, density and halo mass function: Insights from deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss an implementation of a deep learning framework to gain insight into dark matter (DM) structure formation. We investigate the contribution of velocity and density field information to the construction of the halo mass function (HMF) in cosmological N-body simulations. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the initial snapshot of a DM-only simulation to predict the halo mass that individual particles fall into at $z = 0$, in the halo mass range of $10.5 &lt; \log (M/M_{\odot}) &lt; 14$. We show that for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with amplitude of initial perturbations $A_s = 2 \times 10^{-9}$, the initial velocity and density fields have equivalent information, as expected in the linear regime, and manifest the power of our CNN to diagnose the redundant information. To investigate the non-linear effects, we increase the initial power spectrum. In the linear regime, this is equivalent to decreasing the initial redshift. The CNN model trained on the simulation snapshots with large $A_s$ shows a considerable improvement in the HMF prediction when adding the velocity field information. Using our CNN map without further physical assumptions, we precisely evaluate when these non-linear effects become vital. Eventually, for the simulation with $A_s = 8 \times10^{-8}$, the model trained with only density information shows at least an $80\%$ increase in the mean squared error relative to the model with both velocity and density information. Our work shows the interpretability and ability of CNNs to read higher-order information from simple images, making them an excellent tool for cosmological studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest weak gravitational lensing estimator of Metcalf et al. on forest data from hydrodynamic simulations and ray-traced simulated lensing potentials. We compare the results to those obtained from the Gaussian random field simulated Ly$\alpha$ forest data and lensing potentials used in previous work. We find that the estimator is able to reconstruct the lensing potentials from the more realistic data, and investigate dependence on spectrum signal to noise. The non-linearity and non-Gaussianity in this forest data arising from gravitational instability and hydrodynamics causes a reduction in signal to noise by a factor of $\sim2.7$ for noise free data and a factor of $\sim 1.5$ for spectra with signal to noise of order unity (comparable to current observational data). Compared to Gaussian field lensing potentials, using ray-traced potentials from N-body simulations incurs a further signal to noise reduction of a factor of $\sim1.3$ at all noise levels. The non-linearity in the forest data is also observed to increase bias in the reconstructed potentials by $5-25\%$, and the ray-traced lensing potential further increases the bias by $20-30\%$. We demonstrate methods for mitigating these issues including Gaussianization and bias correction which could be used in real observations.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely established that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

Abstract: Filaments connecting halos are a long-standing prediction of cold dark matter theories. We present a detection of the cosmic web emission connecting two quasar-host galaxies at redshift z ~3.22 in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF). The very deep observations unlock a high-definition view of the filament morphology, a measure of the transition radius between the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium, and the characterization of the surface brightness profiles along the filament and in the transverse direction. Through systematic comparisons with simulations, we validate the filaments' typical density predicted in the current cold dark-matter model. Our analysis of the MUDF field, an excellent laboratory for quantitatively studying filaments in emission, opens a new avenue to constrain the physical properties of the cosmic web and to trace the distribution of dark matter on large scales.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection: an alternative explanation of radio emission in galaxy clusters</title>

Abstract: Observations of galaxy clusters show radio emission extended over almost the system scale, necessitating mechanisms for particle acceleration. Previous models for acceleration such as diffusive shock acceleration and that due to turbulence can fall short in terms of efficiency. In this letter, we propose the possibility of acceleration via magnetic reconnection. In particular, we invoke the plasmoid instability which has been previously applied to understand particle energization in high energy systems. Turbulence in galaxy clusters lead to fluctuation dynamos that are known to generate magnetic fields structures consisting of sharp reversals. These form natural sites of reconnection. We perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the plasmoid instability in collisionless and nonrelativistic plasmas. We show that the resulting electron energy spectra have power law indices that are consistent with that inferred from observations. Our estimates show that the acceleration timescales are much smaller than the lifetime of the reconnecting magnetic structures indicating the feasibility of our model. The synchrotron radio luminosity estimate is about $10^{41}$ ergs/s, agreeing with observations. Finally, we find that the maximum achievable Lorentz factor can go upto $10^5$ indicating that acceleration due magnetic reconnection is a promising avenue for understanding the origin of nonthermal emission in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic assessment of dark energy after DESI DR1 BAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Data Release 1) have revealed exciting results that show evidence for dynamical dark energy at $\sim3\sigma$ when combined with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernova observations. These measurements are based on the $w_0w_a$CDM model of dark energy. The evidence is less in other dark energy models such as the $w$CDM model. In order to avoid imposing a dark energy model, we reconstruct the distance measures and the equation of the state of dark energy independent of any dark energy model and driven only by observational data. Our results show that the model-agnostic (in terms of late-time models) evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI is not significant. Our analysis also provides model-independent constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the matter-energy density parameter at present. Although we used CMB distance priors (not full CMB data) from a $\Lambda$CDM early-time model, our results remain largely similar for other cosmological models, provided that these models do not differ significantly from the standard model.</description>

      <title>MeerKLASS L-band deep-field intensity maps: entering the HI dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from MeerKAT single-dish HI intensity maps, the final observations to be performed in L-band in the MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) campaign. The observations represent the deepest single-dish HI intensity maps to date, produced from 41 repeated scans over $236\,{\rm deg}^2$, providing 62 hours of observational data for each of the 64 dishes before flagging. By introducing an iterative self-calibration process, the estimated thermal noise of the reconstructed maps is limited to ${\sim}\,1.21\,$mK ($1.2\,\times$ the theoretical noise level). This thermal noise will be sub-dominant relative to the HI fluctuations on large scales ($k\,{\lesssim}\,0.15\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$), which demands upgrades to power spectrum analysis techniques, particularly for covariance estimation. In this work, we present the improved MeerKLASS analysis pipeline, validating it on both a suite of mock simulations and a small sample of overlapping spectroscopic galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Despite only overlapping with ${\sim}\,25\%$ of the MeerKLASS deep field, and a conservative approach to covariance estimation, we still obtain a ${&gt;}\,4\,\sigma$ detection of the cross-power spectrum between the intensity maps and the 2269 galaxies at the narrow redshift range $0.39\,{&lt;}\,z\,{&lt;}\,0.46$. We briefly discuss the HI auto-power spectrum from this data, the detection of which will be the focus of follow-up work. For the first time with MeerKAT single-dish intensity maps, we also present evidence of HI emission from stacking the maps onto the positions of the GAMA galaxies.</description>

      <title>Ellipticities of Galaxy Cluster Halos from Halo-Shear-Shear Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the halo ellipticities of galaxy clusters by applying the halo-shear-shear correlations (HSSC), without the necessity of major axis determination. We use the Fourier\_Quad shear catalog based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey and the group catalog from the DESI Legacy Surveys for the measurement of group/cluster lensing and HSSC. Our analysis includes the off-centering effects. We obtain the average projected ellipticity of dark matter halos with mass $13.5 &lt; {\rm log} (M_G h/ M_\odot) &lt; 14.5$ within 1.3 virial radius to be $0.48^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$. We divide the sample into two groups based on mass and redshift, and we find that halos with higher mass tend to exhibit increased ellipticity. We also reveal that high-richness halos have larger ellipticities, confirming the physical picture from numerical simulation that high-richiness halos have a dynamical youth and more active mass accretion phase.</description>

      <title>Testing Gravity with Realistic Gravitational Waveforms in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the effects of relaxing the assumption that gravitational waves composing the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) are uncorrelated between frequencies in analyses of the data from Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). While individual monochromatic plane waves are often a good approximation, a background composed of unresolved astrophysical sources cannot be exactly uncorrelated since an infinite plane wave propagates no temporal signal. We consider how relaxing this assumption allows us to extract potential information about modified dispersion relations and other fundamental physics questions, as both the group and phase velocity of waves become relevant. After developing the formalism we carry out simple Gaussian wavepacket examples and then consider more realistic waveforms, such as that from binary inspirals. When the frequency evolves only slowly across the PTA temporal baseline, the monochromatic assumption at an effective mean frequency remains a good approximation and we provide scaling relations that characterize its accuracy.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Detection of Lyman-Alpha Forest Weak Lensing from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Other Future Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The apparent angular positions of quasars are deflected on the sky by the gravitational field sourced by foreground matter. This weak lensing effect is measurable through the distortions it introduces in the lensed quasar spectra. Discrepancies in the statistics of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectral absorption features can be used to reconstruct the foreground lensing potential. We extend the study of this method of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest weak gravitational lensing to lower angular forest spectrum source densities than previous work. We evaluate the performance of the Lyman-$\alpha$ lensing estimator of Metcalf et al. (2020) on mock data based on the angular forest source density ($50$ per square degree) and volume ($\sim$700,000 spectra total) of the DESI survey. We simulate the foreground galaxy distribution and lensing potentials with redshift evolution approximated by N-body simulation and simulate Gaussian-random Lyman-$\alpha$ forests to produce mock data for the entire DESI footprint. By correlating the foreground galaxy distribution with the potential reconstructed by the estimator, we find that a weak lensing detection with signal to noise of $\sim4$ will be possible with the full DESI data. We show that spectral surveys with low density and high volume are promising candidates for forest weak lensing in addition to the high resolution data that have been considered in previous work. We present forecasts for future spectral surveys and show that with larger datasets a detection with signal to noise $&gt;10$ will be possible.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses from large-scale structures: future sensitivity and theory dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the incoming years, cosmological surveys aim at measuring the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$, complementing the determination of their mass ordering from laboratory experiments. In order to assess the full potential of large-scale structures (LSS), we employ state-of-the-art predictions from the effective field theory of LSS (EFTofLSS) at one loop to perform Fisher forecasts on the sensitivity (combining power spectrum and bispectrum) of ongoing and future surveys (DESI, MegaMapper) in combination with CMB measurements (Planck, Litebird and Stage-4). We find that the 1$\sigma$ sensitivity on $\Sigma m_\nu$ is expected to be 15 meV with Planck+DESI, and 7 meV with S4+MegaMapper, where $\sim 10\%$ and $30\%$ of the constraints are brought by the one-loop bispectrum respectively. To understand how robust are these bounds, we explore how they are relaxed when considering extensions to the standard model, dubbed `new physics'. We find that the shift induced on $\Sigma m_\nu$ by a $1\sigma$ shift on new physics parameters (we consider extra relativistic species, neutrino self-interactions, curvature or a time-evolving electron mass) could be $\mathcal O(10)$ meV for Planck+DESI, but it will be suppressed down to $\mathcal O(1)$ meV in S4+MegaMapper. Our study highlights the quantitative impact of including the bispectrum at one loop in the EFTofLSS, and the robustness of the sensitivity to $\Sigma m_\nu$ against potential new physics thanks to the synergy of cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>GalSBI: Phenomenological galaxy population model for cosmology using simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GalSBI, a phenomenological model of the galaxy population for cosmological applications using simulation-based inference. The model is based on analytical parametrizations of galaxy luminosity functions, morphologies and spectral energy distributions. Model constraints are derived through iterative Approximate Bayesian Computation, by comparing Hyper Suprime-Cam deep field images with simulations which include a forward model of instrumental, observational and source extraction effects. We developed an emulator trained on image simulations using a normalizing flow. We use it to accelerate the inference by predicting detection probabilities, including blending effects and photometric properties of each object, while accounting for background and PSF variations. This enables robustness tests for all elements of the forward model and the inference. The model demonstrates excellent performance when comparing photometric properties from simulations with observed imaging data for key parameters such as magnitudes, colors and sizes. The redshift distribution of simulated galaxies agrees well with high-precision photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field within $1.5\sigma$ for all magnitude cuts. Additionally, we demonstrate how GalSBI's redshifts can be utilized for splitting galaxy catalogs into tomographic bins, highlighting its potential for current and upcoming surveys. GalSBI is fully open-source, with the accompanying Python package, $\texttt{galsbi}$, offering an easy interface to quickly generate realistic, survey-independent galaxy catalogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos with masses on the $\mathrm{eV}$ scale are promising candidates to account for the origin of neutrino mass and the reactor neutrino anomalies. The mixing between sterile and active neutrinos in the early universe could result in a large abundance of relic sterile neutrinos, which depends on not only their physical mass $m_{\rm phy}$ but also their degree of thermalization, characterized by the extra effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Using neutrino-involved N-body simulations, we investigate the effects of sterile neutrinos on the matter power spectrum, halo pairwise velocity, and halo mass and velocity functions. We find that the presence of sterile neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum and halo mass and velocity functions, but enhance the halo pairwise velocity. We also provide fitting formulae to quantify these effects.</description>

      <title>Domain wall interpretation of the PTA signal confronting black hole overproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have detected a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hz frequencies, with Domain Wall networks (DWs) proposed as potential sources. To be cosmologically viable, they must annihilate before dominating the universe energy budget, thus generating a SGWB. While sub-horizon DWs shrink and decay rapidly, causality requires DWs with super-horizon size to continue growing until they reach the Hubble horizon. Those entering the latest can be heavier than a Hubble patch and collapse into Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We conduct a Bayesian analysis of the PTA signal, interpreting it as an outcome of SGWB from DW networks, with a prior ensuring no PBH overproduction. Our findings indicate that DWs result in the production of solar-mass PBHs. The binary mergers occurring within these PBHs generate a second SGWB in the kilo-Hz domain which could be observable in on-going or planned Earth-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>The Second-Level Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes two levels of preheating for the inflaton that is non-minimally coupled with gravity. The first level, later named by the quadratic regime, corresponds to the matter-dominated era and is responsible for draining the inflaton's energy density. The second level, which we will call the quartic regime, corresponds to the radiation-dominated era and is responsible for the reheating of the universe. We investigate the behavior of non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in both the quadratic and quartic regimes. In the quadratic regime, the preheating is also efficient, even though it is less than the lower dimension. On the other hand, the non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in the quartic regime are extremely inefficient. In our work, we also introduce a simple mechanism controlled by the characteristic momentum $\alpha$ to suppress the particle production during preheating. Additionally, we emphasized the significance of the small momentum of the particles produced during preheating for the abundance of primordial black holes. This result supports the efficient preheating in the quadratic regime. Finally, we evaluate two modes of the reheating temperature, which differ based on the preheating efficiency during the quadratic regime.</description>

      <title>Dark Galactic subhalos and the Gaia snail</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution. We investigate the possibility that this structure emerges from ongoing perturbations by dark $\left(10^{6} M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}\right)$ Galactic subhalos. We develop a probabilistic model for generating subhalo orbits based on a semi-analytic model of structure formation, and combine this framework with an approximate prescription for calculating the response of the disk to external perturbations. We also develop a phenomenological treatment for the diffusion of phase-space spirals caused by gravitational scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds, a process that erases the kinematic signatures of old ($t \gtrsim 0.6$ Gyr) events. Perturbations caused by dark subhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by luminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold dark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the dynamics of the solar neighborhood. Dark subhalos alone do not cause enough disturbance to explain the Gaia snail, but they excite fluctuations of $\sim 0.1-0.5 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$ in the mean vertical velocity of stars near the Galactic midplane that should persist to the present day. Subhalos also produce correlations between vertical frequency and orbital angle that could be mistaken as originating from a single past disturbance. Our results motivate investigation of the Milky Way's dark satellites by characterizing their kinematic signatures in phase-space spirals across the Galaxy.</description>
