      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>

      <title>Gravity and a universal cutoff for field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the one-loop effects of massive fields on 2-to-2 scattering processes involving gravitons. It has been suggested that in the presence of gravity, any local effective field theory description must break down at the "species scale". We first observe that unitarity and analyticity of the amplitude indeed imply a species-type bound $G\Lambda^{d-2}N\leq O(1)$, where $N$ counts parametrically light species and $\Lambda$ is an energy scale above which new unknown ingredients must modify the graviton amplitude. To clarify what happens at this scale, we contrast the partial wave decomposition of calculated amplitudes with that of some ultraviolet scenarios: string theory and strongly interacting Planck-scale physics. Observing that the latter exhibit a markedly stronger high-spin content, we define nonperturbatively the high-spin onset scale $\Lambda_{\rm o}$, which coincides with the string scale and higher-dimensional Planck scale in respective examples. We argue that, generally, no local field description can exist at distances shorter than $1/\Lambda_{\rm o}$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in 2d HCFTs on the curved background: the case of q-M\"obius Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.</description>

      <title>Global Bases for Nonplanar Loop Integrands, Generalized Unitarity, and the Double Copy to All Loop Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method for defining a global loop-integrand basis for scattering amplitudes, encompassing both planar and nonplanar contributions. Our approach utilizes a graph-based framework to establish a well-defined, non-redundant basis of integrands. This basis, constructed from a chosen set of non-redundant graphs together with a selection of irreducible scalar products, provides clear insights into various physical properties of scattering amplitudes and proves useful in multiple contexts, such as on-shell Ward identities and manifesting gauge-choice independence. A key advantage of our integrand basis is its ability to streamline the generalized unitarity method. Specifically, we can directly read off the coefficients of basis elements without resorting to ansatze or solving linear equations. This novel approach allows us to lift generalized unitarity cuts -- expressed as products of tree amplitudes -- to loop-level integrands, facilitating the use of the tree-level double copy to generate complete gravitational integrands at any loop order. This method circumvents the difficulties in identifying complete higher-loop-order gauge-theory integrands that adhere to the color-kinematics duality. Additionally, our cut-based organization is well-suited for expansion in hard or soft limits, aiding in the exploration of ultraviolet or classical limits of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics from the S-matrix reloaded, with applications to QCD and the confining Flux Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade and more, S-matrix-based calculational methods have experienced a resurgence, proving to be both an elegant and powerful tool for extracting physical quantities without the need for an underlying Lagrangian formulation. In this work, we critically review and further develop the formalism introduced by Dashen, Ma, and Bernstein, which connects the thermodynamics of relativistic systems to the information contained in their scattering amplitudes. As a demonstration, we revisit the computation of the QCD equation of state to leading order in the strong coupling, showcasing the advantages of this method over traditional Thermal Field Theory techniques. Additionally, we apply these tools to the effective theory of a long confining Flux Tube in D dimensions, analyzing thermal effects up to and including NNLO contributions. Our results are compared with those obtained using the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz method. We also discuss how these techniques enable the inclusion of non-universal effects in the study of Flux Tubes, while relying solely on the S-matrix as input.</description>

      <title>Musings on SVD and pseudo entanglement entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy are generalizations of the entanglement entropy that involve post-selection. In this work we analyze their properties as measures on the spaces of quantum states and argue that their excess provides useful characterization of a difference between two (i.e. pre-selected and post-selected) states, which shares certain features and in certain cases can be identified as a metric. In particular, when applied to link complement states that are associated to topological links via Chern-Simons theory, these generalized entropies and their excess provide a novel quantification of a difference between corresponding links. We discuss the dependence of such entropy measures on the level of Chern-Simons theory and determine their asymptotic values for certain link states. We find that imaginary part of the pseudo-entropy is sensitive to, and can diagnose chirality of knots. We also consider properties of these entropy measures for simpler quantum mechanical systems, such as generalized SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states, and tripartite GHZ and W states.</description>

      <title>Kink-antikink collisions in hyper-massive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological kinks and their interactions in a family of scalar field models with a double well potential parametrized by the mass of small perturbations around the vacua, ranging from the mass of the $\phi^4$ Klein-Gordon model all the way to the limit of infinite mass, which is identified with a non-analytic potential. In particular, we look at the problem of kink-antikink collisions and analyze the windows of capture and escape of the soliton pair as a function of collision velocity and model mass. We observe a disappearance of the capture cases for intermediary masses between the $\phi^4$ and non-analytic cases. The main features of the kink-antikink scattering are reproduced in a collective coordinates model, including the disappearance of the capture cases.</description>

      <title>The probabilistic world II : Quantum mechanics from classical statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work discusses simple examples how quantum systems are obtained as subsystems of classical statistical systems. For a single qubit with arbitrary Hamiltonian and for the quantum particle in a harmonic potential we provide explicitly all steps how these quantum systems follow from an overall ''classical" probability distribution for events at all times. This overall probability distribution is the analogue of Feynman's functional integral for quantum mechanics or for the functional integral defining a quantum field theory. In our case the action and associated weight factor are real, however, defining a classical probabilistic system. Nevertheless, a unitary time-evolution of wave functions can be realized for suitable systems, in particular probabilistic automata. Based on these insights we discuss novel aspects for correlated computing not requiring the extreme isolation of quantum computers. A simple neuromorphic computer based on neurons in an active or quiet state within a probabilistic environment can learn the unitary transformations of an entangled two-qubit system. Our explicit constructions constitute a proof that no-go theorems for the embedding of quantum mechanics in classical statistics are circumvented. We show in detail how subsystems of classical statistical systems can explain various ``quantum mysteries". Conceptually our approach is a straightforward derivation starting from an overall probability distribution without invoking non-locality, acausality, contextuality, many worlds or other additional concepts. All quantum laws follow directly from the standard properties of classical probabilities.</description>

      <title>Renormalization, Decoupling and the Hierarchy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hierarchy problem is associated with the renormalization and decoupling. By the decoupling of heavy fields, we can account for the smallness of the scalar mass against loop corrections and its insensitivity to ultraviolet physics. It is essential to correctly identify the observable parameters, which have natural convergence properties, as opposed to the bare ones. The loop corrections are finite and perturbatively expandable order by order. They are suppressed as powers of the external momentum to the mass ratio, according to the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem which we complete for the case of the scalar mass.</description>

      <title>Coadjoint-orbit effective field theory of a Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Mathematica package AmpRed for the semi-automatic calculations of multi-loop Feynman amplitudes with high efficiency and precision. AmpRed implements the methods of integration by parts and differential equations in the Feynman-parameter representation. It allows for the calculations of general parametric integrals (which may not have momentum-space correspondences). Various user-friendly tools for multi-loop calculations, such as those to construct and solve differential equations for Feynman integrals, are provided. It can also deal with tensor algebras in non-relativistic field theories. Interfaces to some packages, like QGRAF and FOMR, are also provided.</description>

      <title>Resonant Forbidden CP Asymmetry from Soft Leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explain the baryon asymmetry in the early universe via leptogenesis, quantum corrections to new particles are commonly invoked to generate the necessary CP asymmetry. We demonstrate, however, that a large CP asymmetry can already arise from Standard Model leptons. The mechanism relies on resummation of soft leptons at finite temperatures. The CP asymmetry, which is kinetically forbidden in vacuum, can be resonantly enhanced from thermally resummed leptons by seven orders of magnitude. Contrary to the resonance from exotic particles, we show that the resonant enhancement from soft leptons is protected by controlled widths under finite-temperature perturbation theory. We quantify such CP asymmetries in leptogenesis with secluded flavor effects and comment on the significance and application. The mechanism exploits the maximal role of leptons themselves, featuring low-scale leptogenesis, minimal model buildings and dark matter cogenesis.</description>

      <title>Interpretating Pulsar Timing Array data of Gravitational Waves with Ekpyrosis-Bouncing Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Geometries Supported by Strange Quark Matter and Phantom-like Generalized Chaplygin gas within $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06605v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial aspect of wormhole (WH) physics is the inclusion of exotic matter, which requires violating the null energy condition. Here, we explore the potential for WHs to be sustained by quark matter under conditions of extreme density along with the phantom-like generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas (GCCG) in symmetric teleparallel gravity. Theoretical and experimental studies on baryon structures indicate that strange quark matter, composed of u (up), d (down), and s (strange) quarks, represents the most energy-efficient form of baryonic matter. Drawing from these theoretical insights, we use the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) bag model equation of state to characterize ordinary quark matter. By formulating specific configurations for the bag parameter, we develop several WH models corresponding to different shape functions for the isotropic and anisotropic cases. Our analysis strongly suggests that an isotropic WH is not theoretically possible. Furthermore, we investigate traversable WH solutions utilizing a phantom-like GCCG, examining their feasibility. This equation of state, capable of violating the null energy condition, can elucidate late-time cosmic acceleration through various beneficial parameters. In this framework, we derive WH solutions for both constant and variable redshift functions. We have employed the volume integral quantifier (VIQ) method for both studies to assess the quantity of exotic matter. Furthermore, we have done the equilibrium analysis through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which supports the viability of our constructed WH model.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD Axions in light of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion stands as one of the most promising candidates for resolving the strong CP problem. However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to an anthropic abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group consistent treatment of color superconductivity in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called dSC phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general motion of spinning test particles to the leading order approximation of spin in the brane-world spacetime is investigated. Analytical integrations for the equations of motion and linear shifts in orbital frequency are obtained. As a result, we found that both the nodal precession and the periastron precession become larger when the tidal charge $b$ of brane-world spacetime becomes smaller. For the periastron precession, the effect is further amplified as the spin increases. Our work can potentially be applied to the study of gravitational waveforms of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals with spin in brane-world spacetime.</description>

      <title>Speed Limits and Scrambling in Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between Krylov complexity and operator quantum speed limits (OQSLs) of the complexity operator and level repulsion in random/integrable matrices and many-body systems. An enhanced level-repulsion corresponds to increased OQSLs in random/integrable matrices. However, in many-body systems, the dynamics is more intricate due to the tensor product structure of the models. Initially, as the integrability-breaking parameter increases, the OQSL also increases, suggesting that breaking integrability allows for faster evolution of the complexity operator. At larger values of integrability-breaking, the OQSL decreases, suggesting a slowdown in the operator's evolution speed. Information-theoretic properties, such as scrambling, coherence and entanglement, of Krylov basis operators in many-body systems, are also investigated. The scrambling behaviour of these operators exhibits distinct patterns in integrable and chaotic cases. For systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics, the Krylov basis operators remain a reliable measure of these properties of the time-evolved operator at late times. However, in integrable systems, the Krylov operator's ability to capture the entanglement dynamics is less effective, especially during late times.</description>

Abstract: For different cohomology theories (including the Hochschild homology, Hodge cohomology, and Chow groups), we identify the cohomology of moduli space of rank 1 perverse coherent sheaves on the blow-up of a surface by Nakajima-Yoshioka as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes with a Fermionic Fock space. As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by geometric correspondences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological collider signals of primordial non-Gaussianity arise at tree level when an extra scalar has Hubble mass during inflation. We critically review the formalism finding that a large class of inflationary theories, based on Planck-scale physics, predict a scalar bi-spectrum around the gravitational floor level. This mild signal arises for example in $R^2$ gravity, in the regime where its gravitational scalar has Hubble-scale mass. Signals much above the gravitational floor arise in theories where scalars undergo multiple turns during inflation, thanks to sub-Planckian physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.15810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we revisit the problem of explicitly computing tree-level scattering amplitudes in various theories in any dimension from worldsheet formulas. The latter are known to produce cubic-tree expansion of tree amplitudes with kinematic numerators automatically satisfying Jacobi-identities, once any half-integrand on the worldsheet is reduced to logarithmic functions. We review a natural class of worldsheet functions called "Cayley functions", which are in one-to-one correspondence with labelled trees, and natural expansions of known half-integrands onto them with coefficients that are particularly compact building blocks of kinematic numerators. We present a general formula expressing kinematic numerators of all cubic trees as linear combinations of coefficients of labelled trees, which satisfy Jacobi identities by construction and include the usual combinations in terms of master numerators as a special case. Our results provide an efficient algorithm, which is implemented in a Mathematica package, for computing all tree amplitudes in theories including non-linear sigma model, special Galileon, Yang-Mills-scalar, Einstein-Yang-Mills and Dirac-Born-Infeld.</description>

Abstract: We study scalar quasinormal modes in a D3/D7 system holographically dual to a quantum field theory with chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature. From the bottom-up approach, we consider a nontrivial dilaton profile which is responsible for the anomalous dimension of the quark condensate. It depends on a new parameter$ q$ in the model. By varying this parameter, we study the behavior of the massive and massless scalar quasinormal modes. The numerical method that we use is the spectral method, and we find that there is no pure imaginary mode for the massless case but it appears by increasing the parameter $q$. It is known that this mode becomes tachyonic for massive cases. Then we turn on a pseudoscalar field and using a simple ansatz study its effect on the quasinormal modes of the scalar field. By varying the parameter of the nontrivial dilaton profile in the model, we qualitatively study quasinormal modes in walking theories.</description>

Abstract: Schr\"odinger cat states, which are superpositions of macroscopically distinct states, are potentially critical resources for upcoming quantum information technologies. In this paper, we introduce a scheme to generate entangled Schr\"odinger cat states in a non-relativistic electric dipole system situated on a two-dimensional plane, along with an external potential and a uniform strong magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that this setup can lead to the phenomenon of collapse and revival of entanglement for a specific range of our model parameters</description>

      <title>Resummation of local and non-local scalar self energies via the Schwinger-Dyson equation in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a massless and minimally coupled self interacting quantum scalar field in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime. The scalar potential is taken to be a hybrid, $V(\phi)= \lambda \phi^4/4!+\beta \phi^3/3!$ ($\lambda &gt;0$). Compared to the earlier well studied $\beta=0$ case, the present potential has a rolling down effect due to the $\phi^3$ term, along with the usual bounding effect due to the $\phi^4$ term. We begin by constructing the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the scalar Feynman propagator up to two loop, at ${\cal O}(\lambda)$, ${\cal O}(\beta^2)$, ${\cal O}(\lambda^2)$ and ${\cal O}(\lambda \beta^2)$. We consider first the local part of the scalar self energy and compute the rest mass squared of the scalar field, dynamically generated via the late time non-perturbative secular logarithms, by resumming the daisy-like graphs. The logarithms associated here are sub-leading, compared to those associated with the non-local, leading terms. We also argue that unlike the quartic case, considering merely the one loop results for the purpose of resummation does not give us any sensible result here. We next construct the non-perturbative two particle irreducible effective action up to three loop and derive from it the Schwinger-Dyson equation once again. This equation is satisfied by the non-perturbative Feynman propagator. By series expanding this propagator, the resummed local part of the self energy is shown to yield the same dynamical mass as that of the above. We next use this equation to resum the effect of the non-local part of the scalar self energy, and show that even though the perturbatively corrected propagator shows secular growth at late times, there exists one resummed solution which is vanishing for large spatial separations, in qualitative agreement with that of the stochastic formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present an algebraic and kinematical analysis of non-commutative $\kappa$-Minkowski spaces within Galilean (non-relativistic) and Carrollian (ultra-relativistic) regimes. Utilizing the theory of Wigner-In\"{o}nu contractions, we begin with a brief review of how one can apply these contractions to the well-known Poincar\'{e} algebra, yielding the corresponding Galilean (both massive and mass-less) and Carrollian algebras as $c \to \infty$ and $c\to 0$, respectively. Subsequently, we methodically apply these contractions to non-commutative $\kappa$-deformed spaces, revealing compelling insights into the interplay among the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$ (with $|a^\nu|$ being of the order of Planck length scale) and the speed of light $c$ as it approaches both infinity and zero. Our exploration predicts a sort of ``branching" of the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$, leading to the emergence of a novel length scale and time scale in either limit. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the examination of curved momentum spaces and their geodesic distances in appropriate subspaces of the $\kappa$-deformed Newtonian and Carrollian space-times. We finally delve into the study of their deformed dispersion relations, arising from these deformed geodesic distances, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nature of these space-times.</description>

Abstract: Non-supersymmetric heterotic strings share various properties with their supersymmetric counterparts. Torus compactifications of the latter live in a component of the moduli space of string vacua with 16 supercharges, and various asymmetric orbifolds thereof realize vacua in other components, exhibiting qualitative differences such as rank reduction. We set out to study the analogous problem for non-supersymmetric heterotic strings, framing it in relation to chiral fermionic CFTs with central charge 24, which were classified recently. We find that for the case analogous to the so-called CHL string, which has gauge group rank reduced by 8, there are in total four non-supersymmetric versions. These include the well known $E_8$ string and three other constructions a la CHL, which can be distinguished qualitatively by how tachyons appear in their classical moduli spaces. We also discuss the classification problem for lower rank theories and the relationship between MSDS models and Scherk-Schwarz reductions.</description>

Abstract: We show that electric fields in compactified spaces may produce Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles even when the energy of electric fields is smaller than KK scale. As an illustrating example, we consider a charged massless complex scalar coupled to U(1) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times {\mathbb S}^1$ and discuss the effect of background gauge potential along a compact direction. The electric field produces the charged Kaluza-Klein particle non-perturbatively, which we call KK Schwinger effect. We quantitatively show that KK modes can be produced even when the electric field energy is much below the KK scale. The mechanism is rather general and similar phenomena would occur in any compactification models when a gauge potential along compact direction evolves in time and experiences large enough field excursion. We also discuss the subtlety of four dimensional effective theory truncated by KK modes at an initial time, when the electric field is turned on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity (QG) has a natural cutoff given by the Planck scale $M_{\rm pl}$. However, it is known that the EFT of gravity can break down at a lower scale, the species scale $\Lambda_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, if there are light species of particles. Here we point out that there is a third scale $\Lambda_{\rm BH}\lesssim \Lambda_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, which marks the inverse length (or the temperature) of the smallest black hole where the EFT gives a correct description of its entropy and free energy. This latter scale is hard to detect from the viewpoint of EFT as it represents a phase transition to a state with lower free energy. We illustrate this using examples drawn from consistent QG landscape. In particular $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ gets related to Gregory--Laflamme transition in the decompactification limits of quantum gravity and to the Horowitz--Polchinski solution in the light perturbative string limits. We propose the existence of $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ marking the temperature at which neutral black holes undergo a phase transition, as a new Swampland condition for all consistent quantum theories of gravity. In the asymptotic regimes of field space $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ is close to the mass scale of the lightest tower but deviates from it as we move inwards in the moduli space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the generalized second law (GSL) for arbitrary cuts of Killing horizons from the perspective of crossed-product gravitational algebras, making use of a recent proposal by one of us for the construction of local gravitational algebras. This construction relies on the existence of a state whose modular flow is geometric on the horizon. In both free and interacting quantum field theories, such states are guaranteed to exist by the properties of half-sided translations on the horizon. Using geometric identities derived from the canonical analysis of general relativity on null surfaces, we show that the crossed product entropy agrees with the generalized entropy of the horizon cut in a semiclassical limit, and further reproduce Wall's result relating the GSL to monotonicity of relative entropy of the quantum field algebras. We also give a novel generalization of the GSL for interacting theories in asymptotically flat spacetimes involving the concept of an algebra at infinity for a half-sided translation, which accounts for triviality of the algebra of fields smeared only on the horizon. Going beyond the semiclassical limit, we compute subleading corrections to the crossed product entropy, but are unable to determine if the GSL continues to hold after accounting for these. We speculate that an improved GSL could follow from a hidden subalgebra structure of the crossed products, assuming the existence of an operator-valued weight between horizon cut algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large $N$ quasifermionic ($QF$) Chern-Simons-matter theories exhibit weakly-broken higher-spin symmetry and contain an infinite-dimensional algebra of almost-conserved higher-spin currents. By analyzing local higher-spin Ward identities, we constrain the higher-spin algebra of this theory, for operators of spin $s&lt;4$. The solution interpolates smoothly between Ward identities of free-fermionic and critical-bosonic $U(N)$ models, in accordance with the bosonization duality. At finite 't Hooft coupling, we decompose four-point current correlators involving $(\partial\cdot J_3)^{QF}$ in terms of free theory structures and identify possible epsilon-transform relations for $QF$ four-point functions. Additionally, we find that higher correlators of the theory develop scheme-independent higher-spin contact terms, stemming from the presence of a background Chern-Simons term in the effective action. These terms are related to similar contact terms of the associated quasibosonic Chern-Simons-matter theory via Legendre transform. The results are supplemented by perturbative checks, including collinear limit computations of $\langle T_{--}J_+J_+\rangle_{QF}$, $\langle T_{--}J_+J_+O\rangle_{QF}$ and $\langle J_{ -- }J_+J_+J_+\rangle_{QF}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the relation between supersymmetric localization on $\mathbb{S}^4$ and standard QFT results for non-conformal theories in flat space. Specifically, we consider 1/2 BPS circular Wilson loops in four-dimensional SU($N$) $\mathcal{N}$= 2 SYM theories with massless hypermultiplets in an arbitrary representation $\mathcal{R}$ such that the $\beta$-function is non-vanishing. On $\mathbb{S}^4$, localization maps this observable into an interacting matrix model. Although conformal symmetry is broken at the quantum level, we show that within a specific regime of validity the matrix model predictions are consistent with perturbation theory in flat space up to order $g^6$. In particular, at this order, localization predicts two classes of corrections proportional to $\zeta(3)$ whose diagrammatic origins in field theory are remarkably different. One class of $\zeta(3)$-like corrections emerges via interference effects between evanescent terms and the ultraviolet (UV) poles associated with the bare coupling constant, while the second one stems from a Feynman integral which retains the same form in flat space and on the sphere.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of the interplay between T-duality and classical stress tensor deformations in two-dimensional sigma models. We first show that a general Abelian T-duality commutes with the $T \overline{T}$ deformation, which can be engineered by a gravitational dressing. Then, by using an auxiliary field formulation of stress tensor deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM), we prove that non-Abelian T-duality and arbitrary $T \overline{T}$-like flows also commute for theories in this class. We argue that all such auxiliary field deformations of both the PCM and its T-dual are classically integrable.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Birefringence from CP-Violating Axion Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmic birefringence signal produced by an ultralight axion field with a small CP-violating coupling to bulk SM matter in addition to the usual CP-preserving photon coupling. The change in the vacuum expectation value of the field between recombination and today results in a frequency-independent rotation of the plane of CMB linear polarization across the entire sky. While many previous approaches rely on the axion rolling from a large initial expectation value, the couplings considered in this work robustly generate the birefringence signal regardless of initial conditions, by sourcing the field from the cosmological nucleon density. We place bounds on such monopole-dipole interactions using measurements of the birefringence angle from Planck and WMAP data, which improve upon existing constraints by up to three orders of magnitude. We also discuss UV completions of this model, and possible strategies to avoid fine-tuning the axion mass.</description>

      <title>Cotton gravity is not predictive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the theory of Cotton gravity proposed by Harada is trivially solved by all isotropic and homogeneous cosmologies. We show that this under-determination is more general. More precisely, the degree of arbitrariness in the solutions increases with the degree of symmetry. We give two simple examples. The first is that of static spherically symmetric solutions, which depend on an arbitrary function of the radial coordinate. The second is that of anisotropic cosmologies, which depend on an arbitrary function of time.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral that counts regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article J. Phys. Compl. 4 (2023) 035005, Kawamoto evoked statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy.
  We upgrade the above treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact formula for counting d-regular graphs in terms of a d-dimensional Gaussian integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral representation for the generating function of d-regular graph counts. Third, we perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs. This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto's earlier findings.</description>

      <title>A machine learning-based study of open-charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: n proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions, the study of charm hadrons plays a pivotal role in understanding the QCD medium and provides an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interaction, as they are mostly produced in the early stages of collisions via hard partonic interactions. The lightest open-charm, $D^{0}$ meson ($c\Bar{u}$), can originate from two separate sources. The prompt $D^{0}$ originates from either direct charm production or the decay of excited open charm states, while the nonprompt stems from the decay of beauty hadrons. In this paper, using different machine learning (ML) algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest, an attempt has been made to segregate the prompt and nonprompt production modes of $D^{0}$ meson signal from its background. The ML models are trained using the invariant mass through its hadronic decay channel, i.e., $D^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+} K^{-}$, pseudoproper time, pseudoproper decay length, and distance of closest approach of $D^{0}$ meson, using PYTHIA8 simulated $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\rm{TeV}$. The ML models used in this analysis are found to retain the pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and collision energy dependence. In addition, we report the ratio of nonprompt to prompt $D^{0}$ yield, the self-normalized yield of prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$ and explore the charmonium, $J/\psi$ to open-charm, $D^{0}$ yield ratio as a function of transverse momenta and normalized multiplicity. The observables studied in this manuscript are well predicted by all the ML models compared to the simulation.</description>

      <title>Polyadic Cantor potential of minimum lacunarity: Special case of super periodic generalized unified Cantor potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bridge the fractal and non-fractal potentials we introduce the concept of generalized unified Cantor potential (GUCP) with the key parameter $N$ which represents the potential count at the stage $S=1$. This system is characterized by total span $L$, stages $S$, scaling parameter $\rho$ and two real numbers $\mu$ and $\nu$. Notably, the polyadic Cantor potential (PCP) system with minimal lacunarity is a specific instance within the GUCP paradigm. Employing the super periodic potential (SPP) formalism, we formulated a closed-form expression for transmission probability $T_{S}(k, N)$ using the $q$-Pochhammer symbol and investigated the features of non-relativistic quantum tunneling through this potential configuration. We show that GUCP system exhibits sharp transmission resonances, differing from traditional quantum systems. Our analysis reveals saturation in the transmission profile with evolving stages $S$ and establishes a significant scaling relationship between reflection probability and wave vector $k$ through analytical derivations.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Asymptotically Hot and Dense QCD Matter: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the "modified" $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated with collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation of accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider accelerating black holes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime and investigate the extremality relations by examining perturbative corrections to both the entropy of black holes and their extremality bounds. It is shown that the so-called Goon and Penco (univeral) relation is also valid for accelerating black holes. Furthermore, it is found that an appropriate matching condition is necessary between the perturbation parameter of the relation with the perturbative correction to such black holes, and the parameter with information about the conical deficits on the north and south poles with the cosmic string tensions in order to satisfy the extremality relations. This result indicates that the extremality (univeral) relation of a class of accelerating black holes holds exhibit behavior similar to the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Positive Mass in General Relativity Without Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in physics is why observed masses are always positive. While energy conditions in quantum field theory can partly answer this problem, in this paper we find evidence that classical general relativity abhors negative masses, without the need for quantum theory or energy conditions. This is done by considering many different models of negative-mass "stars" and showing they are dynamically unstable. A fortiori, we show that any barotropic negative-mass star must be dynamically unstable.</description>
