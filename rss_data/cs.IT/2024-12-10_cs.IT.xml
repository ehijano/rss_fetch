      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Allocation for Hybrid Bit and Generative Semantic Communications in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework consisting of hybrid bit-level and generative semantic communications for efficient downlink image transmission within space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring the reconstruction quality at the ground user, we propose a novel metric for measuring delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize the resource in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.</description>

      <title>Studying the Cycle Complexity of DNA Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storing data in DNA is being explored as an efficient solution for archiving and in-object storage. Synthesis time and cost remain challenging, significantly limiting some applications at this stage. In this paper we investigate efficient synthesis, as it relates to cyclic synchronized synthesis technologies, such as photolithography. We define performance metrics related to the number of cycles needed for the synthesis of any fixed number of bits. We first expand on some results from the literature related to the channel capacity, addressing densities beyond those covered by prior work. This leads us to develop effective encoding achieving rate and capacity that are higher than previously reported. Finally, we analyze cost based on a parametric definition and determine some bounds and asymptotics. We investigate alphabet sizes that can be larger than 4, both for theoretical completeness and since practical approaches to such schemes were recently suggested and tested in the literature.</description>

      <title>Finite-Graph-Cover-Based Analysis of Factor Graphs in Classical and Quantum Information Processing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we leverage finite graph covers to analyze the SPA and the Bethe partition function for both S-FGs and DE-FGs. There are two main contributions in this thesis.
  The first main contribution concerns a special class of S-FGs where the partition function of each S-FG equals the permanent of a nonnegative square matrix. The Bethe partition function for such an S-FG is called the Bethe permanent. A combinatorial characterization of the Bethe permanent is given by the degree-$M$ Bethe permanent, which is defined based on the degree-$M$ graph covers of the underlying S-FG. In this thesis, we prove a degree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based lower bound on the permanent of a non-negative square matrix, resolving a conjecture proposed by Vontobel in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Mar. 2013]. We also prove a degree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based upper bound on the permanent of a non-negative matrix. In the limit $M \to \infty$, these lower and upper bounds yield known Bethe-permanent-based lower and upper bounds on the permanent of a non-negative square matrix.
  The second main contribution is giving a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function for DE-FGs in terms of finite graph covers. In general, approximating the partition function of a DE-FG is more challenging than for an S-FG because the partition function of the DE-FG is a sum of complex values and not just a sum of non-negative real values. Moreover, one cannot apply the method of types for proving the combinatorial characterization as in the case of S-FGs. We overcome this challenge by applying a suitable loop-calculus transform (LCT) for both S-FGs and DE-FGs. Currently, we provide a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of finite graph covers for a class of DE-FGs satisfying an (easily checkable) condition.</description>

      <title>PAC codes with Bounded-Complexity Sequential Decoding: Pareto Distribution and Code Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel variation of polar codes known as polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes has been introduced by Ar{\i}kan. These codes significantly outperform conventional polar and convolutional codes, particularly for short codeword lengths, and are shown to operate very close to the optimal bounds. It has also been shown that if the rate profile of PAC codes does not adhere to certain polarized cutoff rate constraints, the computation complexity for their sequential decoding grows exponentially. In this paper, we address the converse problem, demonstrating that if the rate profile of a PAC code follows the polarized cutoff rate constraints, the required computations for its sequential decoding can be bounded with a distribution that follows a Pareto distribution. This serves as a guideline for the rate-profile design of PAC codes. For a high-rate PAC\,$(1024,899)$ code, simulation results show that the PAC code with Fano decoder, when constructed based on the polarized cutoff rate constraints, achieves a coding gain of more than $0.75$ dB at a frame error rate (FER) of $10^{-5}$ compared to the state-of-the-art 5G polar and LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding Beamforming and Power Control Designs for Multi-Port Matching Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key technologies of sixth generation (6G), such as ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), enable intricate interactions between antennas and wireless propagation environments. As a result, it becomes necessary to develop joint models that encompass both antennas and wireless propagation channels. To achieve this, we utilize the multi-port communication theory, which considers impedance matching among the source, transmission medium, and load to facilitate efficient power transfer. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of insertion loss, mutual coupling, and other factors on the performance of multi-port matching networks. Next, to further improve system performance, we explore two important deep unfolding designs for the multi-port matching networks: beamforming and power control, respectively. For the hybrid beamforming, we develop a deep unfolding framework, i.e., projected gradient descent (PGD)-Net based on unfolding projected gradient descent. For the power control, we design a deep unfolding network, graph neural network (GNN) aided alternating optimization (AO)Net, which considers the interaction between different ports in optimizing power allocation. Numerical results verify the necessity of considering insertion loss in the dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) performance analysis. Besides, the proposed PGD-Net based hybrid beamforming approaches approximate the conventional model-based algorithm with very low complexity. Moreover, our proposed power control scheme has a fast run time compared to the traditional weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method.</description>

      <title>On low-power error-correcting cooling codes with large distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-power error-correcting cooling (LPECC) code was introduced as a coding scheme for communication over a bus by Chee et al. to control the peak temperature, the average power consumption of on-chip buses, and error-correction for the transmitted information, simultaneously. Specifically, an $(n, t, w, e)$-LPECC code is a coding scheme over $n$ wires that avoids state transitions on the $t$ hottest wires and allows at most $w$ state transitions in each transmission, and can correct up to $e$ transmission errors. In this paper, we study the maximum possible size of an $(n, t, w, e)$-LPECC code, denoted by $C(n,t,w,e)$. When $w=e+2$ is large, we establish a general upper bound $C(n,t,w,w-2)\leq \lfloor \binom{n+1}{2}/\binom{w+t}{2}\rfloor$; when $w=e+2=3$, we prove $C(n,t,3,1) \leq \lfloor \frac{n(n+1)}{6(t+1)}\rfloor$. Both bounds are tight for large $n$ satisfying some divisibility conditions. Previously, tight bounds were known only for $w=e+2=3,4$ and $t\leq 2$. In general, when $w=e+d$ is large for a constant $d$, we determine the asymptotic value of $C(n,t,w,w-d)\sim \binom{n}{d}/\binom{w+t}{d}$ as $n$ goes to infinity, which can be extended to $q$-ary codes.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Code Design for Resistive Random-Access Memory Using Channel Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel framework for performance analysis and code design is proposed to address the sneak path (SP) problem in resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) arrays. The main idea is to decompose the ReRAM channel, which is both non-ergodic and data-dependent, into multiple stationary memoryless channels. A finite-length performance bound is derived by analyzing the capacity and dispersion of these stationary memoryless channels. Furthermore, leveraging this channel decomposition, a practical sparse-graph code design is proposed using density evolution. The obtained channel codes are not only asymptotic capacity approaching but also close to the derived finite-length performance bound.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Analysis and Beamforming Design for 3D Extended Target in ISAC: From Optimization to Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station transmits a common signal for joint multi-user communication and extended target (ET) sensing. We first propose a second-order truncated Fourier series surface model for an arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional ET. Utilizing this model, we derive novel closed-form Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the ET kinematic parameter estimation, such as the center range, azimuth angle, elevation angle, and orientation. Further, we formulate and solve two transmit beamforming design problems with optimization algorithms. The first one, named the CRB minimization problem, minimizes the CRB under constraints of communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, transmit power, and ET-specific beam coverage requirement, which is solved using the semidefinite relaxation technique. The second one, named the weighted-ISAC-metric problem, targets an weighted objective function combining the communication sum rate and sensing CRB, and is solved using the successive convex approximation technique. Additionally, by exploiting the penalty method, we introduce an unsupervised learning-based approach and propose a unique ISAC graph neural network (ISACGNN), composed of separate communication, sensing, and integration modules, to address both problems. Numerical results reveal the diverse CRB characteristics for different radar targets. The proposed beamforming designs are superior to existing baselines with better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and a more appropriate beampattern for sensing the 3D ET. Besides, our proposed ISACGNN can effectively mimic the dynamic structures of the SINR, sum rate, and CRB, demonstrating remarkable scalability.</description>

      <title>New Channel Coding Lower Bounds for Noisy Permutation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06497v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the application of point-to-point communication networks and biological storage, we investigate new channel coding bounds for noisy permutation channels with strictly positive and full-rank square matrices. Our new achievability bounds use $\epsilon$-packing with Kullback-Leibler divergence as a metric to bound the distance between distributions and are tighter than existing bounds. Additionally, Gaussian approximations of achievability bounds are derived, and the numerical evaluation shows the precision of the approximation.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Eavesdropper Alliance: How to Achieve Symmetric Privacy in Quantum $X$-Secure $B$-Byzantine $E$-Eavesdropped $U$-Unresponsive $T$-Colluding PIR?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum \emph{symmetric} private information retrieval (QSPIR) problem in a system with $N$ databases and $K$ messages, with $U$ unresponsive servers, $T$-colluding servers, and $X$-security parameter, under several fundamental threat models. In the first model, there are $\mathcal{E}_1$ eavesdropped links in the uplink direction (the direction from the user to the $N$ servers), $\mathcal{E}_2$ eavesdropped links in the downlink direction (the direction from the servers to the user), where $|\mathcal{E}_1|, |\mathcal{E}_2| \leq E$; we coin this eavesdropper setting as \emph{dynamic} eavesdroppers. We show that super-dense coding gain can be achieved for some regimes. In the second model, we consider the case with Byzantine servers, i.e., servers that can coordinate to devise a plan to harm the privacy and security of the system together with static eavesdroppers, by listening to the same links in both uplink and downlink directions. It is important to note the considerable difference between the two threat models, since the eavesdroppers can take huge advantage of the presence of the Byzantine servers. Unlike the previous works in SPIR with Byzantine servers, that assume that the Byzantine servers can send only random symbols independent of the stored messages, we follow the definition of Byzantine servers in \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where the Byzantine servers can send symbols that can be functions of the storage, queries, as well as the random symbols in a way that can produce worse harm to the system. In the third and the most novel threat model, we consider the presence of Byzantine servers and dynamic eavesdroppers together. We show that having dynamic eavesdroppers along with Byzantine servers in the same system model creates more threats to the system than having static eavesdroppers with Byzantine servers.</description>

      <title>Detection of Signals in Colored Noise: Roy's Largest Root Test for Non-central $F$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the signal detection problem in colored noise with an unknown covariance matrix. In particular, we focus on detecting a non-random signal by capitalizing on the leading eigenvalue (a.k.a. Roy's largest root) of the whitened sample covariance matrix as the test statistic. To this end, the whitened sample covariance matrix is constructed via \(m\)-dimensional \(p \) plausible signal-bearing samples and \(m\)-dimensional \(n \) noise-only samples. Since the signal is non-random, the whitened sample covariance matrix turns out to have a {\it non-central} \(F\)-distribution with a rank-one non-centrality parameter. Therefore, the performance of the test entails the statistical characterization of the leading eigenvalue of the non-central \(F\)-matrix, which we address by deriving its cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) in closed-form by leveraging the powerful orthogonal polynomial approach in random matrix theory. This new c.d.f. has been instrumental in analyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the detector. We also extend our analysis into the high dimensional regime in which \(m,n\), and \(p\) diverge such that \(m/n\) and \(m/p\) remain fixed. It turns out that, when \(m=n\) and fixed, the power of the test improves if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is of at least \(O(p)\), whereas the corresponding SNR in the high dimensional regime is of at least \(O(p^2)\). Nevertheless, more intriguingly, for \(m&lt;n\) with the SNR of order \(O(p)\), the leading eigenvalue does not have power to detect {\it weak} signals in the high dimensional regime.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communications and Sensing: Their Models and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significant progress of quantum sensing technologies offer numerous radical solutions for measuring a multitude of physical quantities at an unprecedented precision. Among them, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) emerge as an eminent solution for detecting the electric field of radio frequency (RF) signals, exhibiting a great potential in assisting classical wireless communications and sensing. So far, most experimental studies have aimed for the proof of physical concepts to reveal its promise, while the practical signal model of RAQR-aided wireless communications and sensing remained under-explored. Furthermore, the performance of RAQR-based wireless receivers and their advantages over the conventional RF receivers have not been fully characterized. To fill the gap, we introduce the superheterodyne version of RAQRs to the wireless community by presenting an end-to-end reception scheme. We then develop a corresponding equivalent baseband signal model relying on a realistic reception flow. Our scheme and model provide explicit design guidance to RAQR-aided wireless systems. We next study the performance of RAQR-aided wireless systems based on our model, and compare them to a half-wavelength dipole antenna based conventional RF receiver. The results show that the RAQR is capable of achieving a substantial receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of $\sim 22.6$ decibel (dB) and $\sim 33.5$ dB in the standard (unoptimized) and optimized configurations, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Dataset Similarity Evaluation Framework for Wireless Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a task-specific, model-agnostic framework for evaluating dataset similarity, providing a means to assess and compare dataset realism and quality. Such a framework is crucial for augmenting real-world data, improving benchmarking, and making informed retraining decisions when adapting to new deployment settings, such as different sites or frequency bands. The proposed framework is employed to design metrics based on UMAP topology-preserving dimensionality reduction, leveraging Wasserstein and Euclidean distances on latent space KNN clusters. The designed metrics show correlations above 0.85 between dataset distances and model performances on a channel state information compression unsupervised machine learning task leveraging autoencoder architectures. The results show that the designed metrics outperform traditional methods.</description>

      <title>DM-SBL: Channel Estimation under Structured Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel estimation is a fundamental task in communication systems and is critical for effective demodulation. While most works deal with a simple scenario where the measurements are corrupted by the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), this work addresses the more challenging scenario where both AWGN and structured interference coexist. Such conditions arise, for example, when a sonar/radar transmitter and a communication receiver operate simultaneously within the same bandwidth. To ensure accurate channel estimation in these scenarios, the sparsity of the channel in the delay domain and the complicate structure of the interference are jointly exploited. Firstly, the score of the structured interference is learned via a neural network based on the diffusion model (DM), while the channel prior is modeled as a Gaussian distribution, with its variance controlling channel sparsity, similar to the setup of the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). Then, two efficient posterior sampling methods are proposed to jointly estimate the sparse channel and the interference. Nuisance parameters, such as the variance of the prior are estimated via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is termed as DM based SBL (DM-SBL). Numerical simulations demonstrate that DM-SBL significantly outperforms conventional approaches that deal with the AWGN scenario, particularly under low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) conditions. Beyond channel estimation, DM-SBL also shows promise for addressing other linear inverse problems involving structured interference.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing and Tensor Networks: a Powerful Combination to Solve Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has long promised to revolutionize the way we solve complex problems. At the same time, tensor networks are widely used across various fields due to their computational efficiency and capacity to represent intricate systems. While both technologies can address similar problems, the primary aim of this thesis is not to compare them. Such comparison would be unfair, as quantum devices are still in an early stage, whereas tensor network algorithms represent the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation. Instead, we explore a potential synergy between these technologies, focusing on how two flagship algorithms from each paradigm, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and quantum annealing, might collaborate in the future. Furthermore, a significant challenge in the DMRG algorithm is identifying an appropriate tensor network representation for the quantum system under study. The representation commonly used is called Matrix Product Operator (MPO), and it is notoriously difficult to obtain for certain systems. This thesis outlines an approach to this problem using finite automata, which we apply to construct the MPO for our case study. Finally, we present a practical application of this framework through the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). Despite its apparent simplicity, the QKP is a fundamental problem in computer science with numerous practical applications. In addition to quantum annealing and the DMRG algorithm, we implement a dynamic programming approach to evaluate the quality of our results. Our results highlight the power of tensor networks and the potential of quantum annealing for solving optimization problems. Moreover, this thesis is designed to be self-explanatory, ensuring that readers with a solid mathematical background can fully understand the content without prior knowledge of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>On an Analytical Inversion Formula for the Modulo Radon Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proves a novel analytical inversion formula for the so-called modulo Radon transform (MRT), which models a recently proposed approach to one-shot high dynamic range tomography. It is based on the solution of a Poisson problem linking the Laplacian of the Radon transform (RT) of a function to its MRT in combination with the classical filtered back projection formula for inverting the RT. Discretizing the inversion formula using Fourier techniques leads to our novel Laplacian Modulo Unfolding - Filtered Back Projection algorithm, in short LMU-FBP, to recover a function from fully discrete MRT data. Our theoretical findings are finally supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Linear codes associated to symmetric determinantal varieties; General case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of linear codes over a finite field of odd cardinality, derived from determinantal varieties obtained from symmetric matrices of bounded rank, was initiated in a recent paper by the authors. There, one found the minimum distance of the code obtained from evaluating homogeneous linear functions at all symmetric matrices with rank, which is, at most, a given even number. Furthermore, a conjecture for the minimum distance of codes from symmetric matrices with ranks bounded by an odd number was given.
  In this article, we continue the study of codes from symmetric matrices of bounded rank. A connection between the weights of the codewords of this code and Q-numbers of the association scheme of symmetric matrices is established. Consequently, we get a concrete formula for the weight distribution of these codes. Finally, we determine the minimum distance of the code obtained from evaluating homogeneous linear functions at all symmetric matrices with rank at most a given number, both when this number is odd and when it is even.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer-based Semantic Communications With Importance-Aware Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications provide significant performance gains over traditional communications by transmitting task-relevant semantic features through wireless channels. However, most existing studies rely on end-to-end (E2E) training of neural-type encoders and decoders to ensure effective transmission of these semantic features. To enable semantic communications without relying on E2E training, this paper presents a vision transformer (ViT)-based semantic communication system with importance-aware quantization (IAQ) for wireless image transmission. The core idea of the presented system is to leverage the attention scores of a pretrained ViT model to quantify the importance levels of image patches. Based on this idea, our IAQ framework assigns different quantization bits to image patches based on their importance levels. This is achieved by formulating a weighted quantization error minimization problem, where the weight is set to be an increasing function of the attention score. Then, an optimal incremental allocation method and a low-complexity water-filling method are devised to solve the formulated problem. Our framework is further extended for realistic digital communication systems by modifying the bit allocation problem and the corresponding allocation methods based on an equivalent binary symmetric channel (BSC) model. Simulations on single-view and multi-view image classification tasks show that our IAQ framework outperforms conventional image compression methods in both error-free and realistic communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>MIMO Detection under Hardware Impairments: Data Augmentation With Boosting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a data detection problem for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with hardware impairments. To facilitate maximum likelihood (ML) data detection without knowledge of nonlinear and unknown hardware impairments, we develop novel likelihood function (LF) estimation methods based on data augmentation and boosting. The core idea of our methods is to generate multiple augmented datasets by injecting noise with various distributions into seed data consisting of online received signals. We then estimate the LF using each augmented dataset based on either the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm or the kernel density estimation (KDE) method. Inspired by boosting, we further refine the estimated LF by linearly combining the multiple LF estimates obtained from the augmented datasets. To determine the weights for this linear combination, we develop three methods that take different approaches to measure the reliability of the estimated LFs. Simulation results demonstrate that both the EM- and KDE-based LF estimation methods offer significant performance gains over existing LF estimation methods. Our results also show that the effectiveness of the proposed methods improves as the size of the augmented data increases.</description>

      <title>A Linear-Time Algorithm for the Closest Vector Problem of Triangular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy Extractor (FE) and Fuzzy Signature (FS) are useful schemes for generating cryptographic keys from fuzzy data such as biometric features. Several techniques have been proposed to implement FE and FS for fuzzy data in an Euclidean space, such as facial feature vectors, that use triangular lattice-based error correction. In these techniques, solving the closest vector problem (CVP) in a high dimensional (e.g., 128--512 dim.) lattice is required at the time of key reproduction or signing. However, solving CVP becomes computationally hard as the dimension $n$ increases. In this paper, we first propose a CVP algorithm in triangular lattices with $O(n \log n)$-time whereas the conventional one requires $O(n^2)$-time. Then we further improve it and construct an $O(n)$-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Measuring Grammatical Diversity from Small Corpora: Derivational Entropy Rates, Mean Length of Utterances, and Annotation Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many fields, such as language acquisition, neuropsychology of language, the study of aging, and historical linguistics, corpora are used for estimating the diversity of grammatical structures that are produced during a period by an individual, community, or type of speakers. In these cases, treebanks are taken as representative samples of the syntactic structures that might be encountered. Generalizing the potential syntactic diversity from the structures documented in a small corpus requires careful extrapolation whose accuracy is constrained by the limited size of representative sub-corpora. In this article, I demonstrate -- theoretically, and empirically -- that a grammar's derivational entropy and the mean length of the utterances (MLU) it generates are fundamentally linked, giving rise to a new measure, the derivational entropy rate. The mean length of utterances becomes the most practical index of syntactic complexity; I demonstrate that MLU is not a mere proxy, but a fundamental measure of syntactic diversity. In combination with the new derivational entropy rate measure, it provides a theory-free assessment of grammatical complexity. The derivational entropy rate indexes the rate at which different grammatical annotation frameworks determine the grammatical complexity of treebanks. I introduce the Smoothed Induced Treebank Entropy (SITE) as a tool for estimating these measures accurately, even from very small treebanks. I conclude by discussing important implications of these results for both NLP and human language processing.</description>

      <title>UCB algorithms for multi-armed bandits: Precise regret and adaptive inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms are a widely-used class of sequential algorithms for the $K$-armed bandit problem. Despite extensive research over the past decades aimed at understanding their asymptotic and (near) minimax optimality properties, a precise understanding of their regret behavior remains elusive. This gap has not only hindered the evaluation of their actual algorithmic efficiency, but also limited further developments in statistical inference in sequential data collection.
  This paper bridges these two fundamental aspects--precise regret analysis and adaptive statistical inference--through a deterministic characterization of the number of arm pulls for an UCB index algorithm [Lai87, Agr95, ACBF02]. Our resulting precise regret formula not only accurately captures the actual behavior of the UCB algorithm for finite time horizons and individual problem instances, but also provides significant new insights into the regimes in which the existing theory remains informative. In particular, we show that the classical Lai-Robbins regret formula is exact if and only if the sub-optimality gaps exceed the order $\sigma\sqrt{K\log T/T}$. We also show that its maximal regret deviates from the minimax regret by a logarithmic factor, and therefore settling its strict minimax optimality in the negative.
  The deterministic characterization of the number of arm pulls for the UCB algorithm also has major implications in adaptive statistical inference. Building on the seminal work of [Lai82], we show that the UCB algorithm satisfies certain stability properties that lead to quantitative central limit theorems in two settings including the empirical means of unknown rewards in the bandit setting. These results have an important practical implication: conventional confidence sets designed for i.i.d. data remain valid even when data are collected sequentially.</description>

      <title>Fast Matrix Multiplication meets the Subdmodular Width</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06189v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One fundamental question in database theory is the following: Given a Boolean conjunctive query Q, what is the best complexity for computing the answer to Q in terms of the input database size N? When restricted to the class of combinatorial algorithms, it is known that the best known complexity for any query Q is captured by the submodular width of Q. However, beyond combinatorial algorithms, certain queries are known to admit faster algorithms that often involve a clever combination of fast matrix multiplication and data partitioning. Nevertheless, there is no systematic way to derive and analyze the complexity of such algorithms for arbitrary queries Q.
  In this work, we introduce a general framework that captures the best complexity for answering any Boolean conjunctive query Q using matrix multiplication. Our framework unifies both combinatorial and non-combinatorial techniques under the umbrella of information theory. It generalizes the notion of submodular width to a new stronger notion called the omega-submodular width that naturally incorporates the power of fast matrix multiplication. We describe a matching algorithm that computes the answer to any query Q in time corresponding to the omega-submodular width of Q. We show that our framework recovers the best known complexities for Boolean queries that have been studied in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, and also discovers new algorithms for some classes of queries that improve upon the best known complexities.</description>

      <title>Understanding Factual Recall in Transformers via Associative Memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated an impressive ability to perform factual recall. Prior work has found that transformers trained on factual recall tasks can store information at a rate proportional to their parameter count. In our work, we show that shallow transformers can use a combination of associative memories to obtain such near optimal storage capacity. We begin by proving that the storage capacities of both linear and MLP associative memories scale linearly with parameter count. We next introduce a synthetic factual recall task, and prove that a transformer with a single layer of self-attention followed by an MLP can obtain 100% accuracy on the task whenever either the total number of self-attention parameters or MLP parameters scales (up to log factors) linearly with the number of facts. In particular, the transformer can trade off between using the value matrices or the MLP as an associative memory to store the dataset of facts. We complement these expressivity results with an analysis of the gradient flow trajectory of a simplified linear attention model trained on our factual recall task, where we show that the model exhibits sequential learning behavior.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of ANS Entropy Encoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) is a class of entropy encoders that had an immense impact on the data compression, substituting arithmetic and Huffman coding. It was studied by different authors but the precise asymptotics of its redundancy (in relation to the entropy) was not completely understood. We obtain optimal bounds for the redundancy of the tabled ANS (tANS), the most popular ANS variant. Given a sequence $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ of symbols from an alphabet $\{0,1,\ldots,\sigma-1\}$ such that each symbol $a$ occurs in it $f_a$ times and $n=2^r$, the tANS encoder using Duda's ``precise initialization'' to fill tANS tables transforms this sequence into a bit string of the following length (the frequencies are not included in the encoding): $\sum\limits_{a\in[0..\sigma)}f_a\cdot\log\frac{n}{f_a}+O(\sigma+r)$, where $O(\sigma+r)$ can be bounded by $\sigma\log e+r$. The $r$-bit term is an artifact indispensable to ANS; the rest incurs a redundancy of $O(\frac{\sigma}{n})$ bits per symbol. We complement this by examples showing that an $\Omega(\sigma+r)$ redundancy is necessary. We argue that similar examples exist for most adequate initialization methods for tANS. Thus, we refute Duda's conjecture that the redundancy is $O(\frac{\sigma}{n^2})$ bits per symbol. We also propose a variant of the range ANS (rANS), called rANS with fixed accuracy, parameterized by $k\ge 1$. In this variant the integer division, which is unavoidable in rANS, is performed only when its result belongs to $[2^k..2^{k+1})$. Therefore, the division can be computed by faster methods provided $k$ is small. We bound the redundancy for our rANS variant by $\frac{n}{2^k-1}\log e+r$.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Indoor VLC Network with Secure Downlink NOMA for Body Blockage Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of indoor visible light communication (VLC) networks based on power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for mobile devices, where multiple legitimate users are equipped with photodiodes (PDs). We propose a body blockage model for both the legitimate users and eavesdropper to address scenarios where the communication links from transmitting light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to receiving devices are blocked by the bodies of all parties. Furthermore, we propose a novel LED arrangement that improves secrecy without requiring knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper. This arrangement reduces the overlapping areas covered by different LED units supporting distinct users. We also suggest two LED transmission strategies, i.e., simple and smart LED linking, and compare their performance with the conventional broadcasting in terms of transmission sum rate and secrecy sum rate. Through computer simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed strategies to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Broadcast Channel Coding: Algorithmic Aspects and Non-Signaling Assistance</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of coding for classical broadcast channels, which entails maximizing the success probability that can be achieved by sending a fixed number of messages over a broadcast channel. For point-to-point channels, Barman and Fawzi found in~\cite{BF18} a $(1-e^{-1})$-approximation algorithm running in polynomial time, and showed that it is \textrm{NP}-hard to achieve a strictly better approximation ratio. Furthermore, these algorithmic results were at the core of the limitations they established on the power of non-signaling assistance for point-to-point channels. It is natural to ask if similar results hold for broadcast channels, exploiting links between approximation algorithms of the channel coding problem and the non-signaling assisted capacity region.
  In this work, we make several contributions on algorithmic aspects and non-signaling assisted capacity regions of broadcast channels. For the class of deterministic broadcast channels, we describe a $(1-e^{-1})^2$-approximation algorithm running in polynomial time, and we show that the capacity region for that class is the same with or without non-signaling assistance. Finally, we show that in the value query model, we cannot achieve a better approximation ratio than $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\right)$ in polynomial time for the general broadcast channel coding problem, with $m$ the size of one of the outputs of the channel.</description>

      <title>Successive Bayesian Reconstructor for Channel Estimation in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06551v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their antenna locations freely within a spatially continuous space. To keep favorable antenna positions, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential. While some techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain sparsity. When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may lead to unpredictable performance losses. In this paper, we propose the successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS channels. Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided, which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition. Inspired by Bayesian regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based sampling and regression. In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed stochastic process can be viewed as a Bayesian channel estimator. Simulation results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance Analysis of Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted NOMA Networks</title>

Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve the secrecy communication performance of wireless users, it still faces challenges such as limited coverage and double-fading effect. To address these issues, in this paper, we utilize a novel multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS) to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless users, and investigate the physical layer secrecy problem in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. Specifically, we derive the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy throughput expressions of users in MF-RIS-assisted NOMA networks with external and internal eavesdroppers. The asymptotic expressions for SOP and secrecy diversity order are also analyzed under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additionally, we examine the impact of receiver hardware limitations and error transmission-induced imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the secrecy performance. Numerical results indicate that: i) under the same power budget, the secrecy performance achieved by MF-RIS significantly outperforms active RIS and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS; ii) with increasing power budget, residual interference caused by imperfect SIC surpasses thermal noise as the primary factor affecting secrecy capacity; and iii) deploying additional elements at the MF-RIS brings significant secrecy enhancements for the external eavesdropping scenario, in contrast to the internal eavesdropping case.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Beamforming Training in Terahertz Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) enables promising Tbps-level wireless transmission thanks to its prospect of ultra-huge spectrum utilization and narrow beamforming in the next sixth-generation (6G) communication system. Compared to millimeter wave (mmWave), THz intrinsically possesses compellingly severer molecular absorption and high pathloss serving confined coverage area. These defects should be well conquered under the employment of ultra-thin 3D beamforming with enormous deployed antennas with high beam gains. However, pencil-beams require substantially high overhead of time and power to train its optimal THz beamforming direction. We propose an energy efficient (EE) oriented THz beamforming (EETBF) scheme by separating the original complex problem into beamforming training (EETBF-BT) acquirement and learning-enabled training power assignment (EETBF-PA). The historical beam data is employed to update next beam selection policy. The performance results have demonstrated that the proposed EETBF outperforms the existing benchmarks leveraging full beam search, iterative search, linear/binary search as well as non-power-control based mechanism in open literature. Our proposed EETBF scheme results in the lowest training latency and power consumption, achieving the highest effective rate and EE performance.</description>

      <title>What If We Had Used a Different App? Reliable Counterfactual KPI Analysis in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern wireless network architectures, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), the operation of the radio access network (RAN) is managed by applications, or apps for short, deployed at intelligent controllers. These apps are selected from a given catalog based on current contextual information. For instance, a scheduling app may be selected on the basis of current traffic and network conditions. Once an app is chosen and run, it is no longer possible to directly test the key performance indicators (KPIs) that would have been obtained with another app. In other words, we can never simultaneously observe both the actual KPI, obtained by the selected app, and the counterfactual KPI, which would have been attained with another app, for the same network condition, making individual-level counterfactual KPIs analysis particularly challenging. This what-if analysis, however, would be valuable to monitor and optimize the network operation, e.g., to identify suboptimal app selection strategies. This paper addresses the problem of estimating the values of KPIs that would have been obtained if a different app had been implemented by the RAN. To this end, we propose a conformal-prediction-based counterfactual analysis method for wireless systems that provides reliable error bars for the estimated KPIs, despite the inherent covariate shift between logged and test data. Experimental results for medium access control-layer apps and for physical-layer apps demonstrate the merits of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of the Peak Limited and Band Limited Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Peak-Power Limited (PPL) Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels in which the signal is band-limited, and its instantaneous power cannot exceed the power P. This model is relevant to many communication systems; however, its capacity is still unknown. We use a new geometry-based approach which evaluates the maximal entropy of the transmitted signal by assessing the volume of the body, in the space of Nyquist-rate samples, comprising all the points the transmitted signal can reach. This leads to lower bounds on capacity which are tight at high Signal to Noise Ratios (SNR). We found lower bounds on capacity, expressed as power efficiency, higher than the known ones by a factor of 3.35 and 8.6 in the low pass and the band pass cases respectively. The gap to the upper bounds is reduced to a power ratio of 1.5. The new bounds are numerically evaluated for FDMA-style signals with limited duration and also derived in the general case as a conjecture. The penalty in power efficiency due to the peak power constraint is roughly 6 dB at high SNR. Further research is needed to develop effective modulation and coding for this channel.</description>

      <title>Assessing GPT Model Uncertainty in Mathematical OCR Tasks via Entropy Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the uncertainty of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models in extracting mathematical equations from images of varying resolutions and converting them into LaTeX code. We employ concepts of entropy and mutual information to examine the recognition process and assess the model's uncertainty in this Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task. By analyzing the conditional entropy of the output token sequences, we provide both theoretical insights and practical measurements of the GPT model's performance given different image qualities.
  Our experimental results, obtained using a Python implementation available on GitHub, demonstrate a clear relationship between image resolution and GPT model uncertainty. Higher-resolution images lead to lower entropy values, indicating reduced uncertainty and improved accuracy in the recognized LaTeX code. Conversely, lower-resolution images result in increased entropy, reflecting higher uncertainty and a higher likelihood of recognition errors. These findings highlight the practical importance of considering image quality in GPT-based mathematical OCR applications and demonstrate how entropy analysis, grounded in information-theoretic concepts, can effectively quantify model uncertainty in real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Blind Interference Alignment for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication Integration Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide significant enhancements in performance and resource efficiency compared to individual sensing and communication systems, primarily attributed to the collaborative use of wireless resources, radio waveforms, and hardware platforms. The performance limits of a system are crucial for guiding its design; however, the performance limits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems remain an open question. This paper focuses on the bistatic ISAC systems with dispersed multi-receivers and one sensor. Compared to the monostatic ISAC systems, the main challenge is that that the communication messages are unknown to the sensor and thus become its interference, while the channel information between the transmitters and the sensor is unknown to the transmitters. In order to mitigate the interference at the sensor while maximizing the communication degree of freedom, we introduce the blind interference alignment strategy for various bistatic ISAC settings, including interference channels, MU-MISO channels, and MU-MIMO channels. Under each of such system, the achieved ISAC tradeoff points by the proposed schemes in terms of communication and sensing degrees of freedom are characterized, which outperforms the time-sharing between the two extreme sensing-optimal and communication-optimal points.Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly improve on the ISAC performance compared to treating interference as noise at the sensor.</description>

      <title>On the Ratio of Shannon Numbers of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06155v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a function that maps two arbitrary graphs $G$ and $H$ to a non-negative real number such that $$\alpha(G^{\boxtimes n})\leq \alpha(H^{\boxtimes n})\Gamma(G,H)^n$$ where $n$ is any natural number and $G^{\boxtimes n}$ is the strong product of $G$ with itself $n$ times. We establish the equivalence of two different approaches for finding such a function $\Gamma$. The common solution obtained through either approach is termed ``the relative fractional independence number of a graph $G$ with respect to another graph $H$". We show this function by $\alpha^*(G|H)$ and discuss some of its properties. In particular, we show that $\alpha^*(G|H)\geq \frac{X(G)}{X(H)} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha^*(H|G)},$ where $X(G)$ can be the independence number, the Shannon capacity, the fractional independence number, the Lov\'{a}sz number, or the Schrijver's or Szegedy's variants of the Lov\'{a}sz number of a graph $G$. This inequality is the first explicit non-trivial upper bound on the ratio of the invariants of two arbitrary graphs, as mentioned earlier, which can also be used to obtain upper or lower bounds for these invariants. As explicit applications, we present new upper bounds for the ratio of the Shannon capacity of two Cayley graphs and compute new lower bounds on the Shannon capacity of certain Johnson graphs (yielding the exact value of their Haemers number). Moreover, we show that $\alpha^*(G|H)$ can be used to present a stronger version of the well-known No-Homomorphism Lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the most popular approach to deep generative modeling of images, largely due to their empirical performance and reliability. From a theoretical standpoint, a number of recent works~\cite{chen2022,chen2022improved,benton2023linear} have studied the iteration complexity of sampling, assuming access to an accurate diffusion model. In this work, we focus on understanding the \emph{sample complexity} of training such a model; how many samples are needed to learn an accurate diffusion model using a sufficiently expressive neural network? Prior work~\cite{BMR20} showed bounds polynomial in the dimension, desired Total Variation error, and Wasserstein error. We show an \emph{exponential improvement} in the dependence on Wasserstein error and depth, along with improved dependencies on other relevant parameters.</description>

Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a stochastic zero-sum game over continuous-time dynamics to analyze the competition between the attacker, who tries to covertly misguide the vehicle to an unsafe region, versus the detector, who tries to detect the attack signal based on the observed trajectory of the vehicle. Based on Girsanov's theorem and the generalized Neyman-Pearson lemma, we show that a constant bias injection attack as the attacker's strategy and a likelihood ratio test as the detector's strategy constitute the unique saddle point of the game. We also derive the first-order and the second-order exponents of the type II error as a function of the data length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models can now produce photorealistic synthetic data which is virtually indistinguishable from the real data used to train it. This is a significant evolution over previous models which could produce reasonable facsimiles of the training data, but ones which could be visually distinguished from the training data by human evaluation. Recent work on OOD detection has raised doubts that generative model likelihoods are optimal OOD detectors due to issues involving likelihood misestimation, entropy in the generative process, and typicality. We speculate that generative OOD detectors also failed because their models focused on the pixels rather than the semantic content of the data, leading to failures in near-OOD cases where the pixels may be similar but the information content is significantly different. We hypothesize that estimating typical sets using self-supervised learners leads to better OOD detectors. We introduce a novel approach that leverages representation learning, and informative summary statistics based on manifold estimation, to address all of the aforementioned issues. Our method outperforms other unsupervised approaches and achieves state-of-the art performance on well-established challenging benchmarks, and new synthetic data detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam with Interaction: A Unifying Lower Bound Framework and Characterization for Bandit Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unifying framework for information-theoretic lower bound in statistical estimation and interactive decision making. Classical lower bound techniques -- such as Fano's method, Le Cam's method, and Assouad's lemma -- are central to the study of minimax risk in statistical estimation, yet are insufficient to provide tight lower bounds for \emph{interactive decision making} algorithms that collect data interactively (e.g., algorithms for bandits and reinforcement learning). Recent work of Foster et al. (2021, 2023) provides minimax lower bounds for interactive decision making using seemingly different analysis techniques from the classical methods. These results -- which are proven using a complexity measure known as the \emph{Decision-Estimation Coefficient} (DEC) -- capture difficulties unique to interactive learning, yet do not recover the tightest known lower bounds for passive estimation. We propose a unified view of these distinct methodologies through a new lower bound approach called \emph{interactive Fano method}. As an application, we introduce a novel complexity measure, the \emph{Fractional Covering Number}, which facilitates the new lower bounds for interactive decision making that extend the DEC methodology by incorporating the complexity of estimation. Using the fractional covering number, we (i) provide a unified characterization of learnability for \emph{any} stochastic bandit problem, (ii) close the remaining gap between the upper and lower bounds in Foster et al. (2021, 2023) (up to polynomial factors) for any interactive decision making problem in which the underlying model class is convex.</description>

      <title>A Simple Model of Inference Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws have garnered significant interest due to their ability to predict model performance as a function of increasing parameters, data, and compute. In this work, we propose a simple statistical ansatz based on memorization to study scaling laws in the context of inference, specifically how performance improves with multiple inference attempts. We explore the coverage, or pass@k metric, which measures the chance of success over repeated attempts and provide a motivation for the observed functional form of the inference scaling behavior of the coverage in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. We then define an "inference loss", which exhibits a power law decay as the number of trials increases, and connect this result with prompting costs. We further test our construction by conducting experiments on a simple generative model, and find that our predictions are in agreement with the empirical coverage curves in a controlled setting. Our simple framework sets the ground for incorporating inference scaling with other known scaling laws.</description>
