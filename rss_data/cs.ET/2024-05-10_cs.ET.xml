      <title>Design and Implementation of Energy-Efficient Wireless Tire Sensing System with Delay Analysis for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to a rise in the popularity of intelligent vehicles that incorporate a range of sensors to monitor various aspects, such as driving speed, fuel usage, distance proximity and tire anomalies. Nowadays, real-time tire sensing systems play important roles for intelligent vehicles in increasing mileage, reducing fuel consumption, improving driving safety, and reducing the potential for traffic accidents. However, the current tire sensing system drains a significant vehicle' energy and lacks effective collection of sensing data, which may not guarantee the immediacy of driving safety. Thus, this paper designs an energy-efficient wireless tire sensing system (WTSS), which leverages energy-saving techniques to significantly reduce power consumption while ensuring data retrieval delays during real-time monitoring. Additionally, we mathematically analyze the worst-case transmission delay and sensor reception ratio of the system to ensure the immediacy based on the collision probabilities of sensor transmissions. This system has been implemented and verified by the simulation and field train experiments. These results show that the proposed scheme provides enhanced performance in energy efficiency up to 76.5% in average and identifies the worst transmission delay accurately.</description>

      <title>Investigating impact of bit-flip errors in control electronics on quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of bit flip errors in FPGA memories in control electronics on quantum computing systems. FPGA memories are integral in storing the amplitude and phase information pulse envelopes, which are essential for generating quantum gate pulses. However, these memories can incur faults due to physical and environmental stressors such as electromagnetic interference, power fluctuations, and temperature variations and adversarial fault injections, potentially leading to errors in quantum gate operations. To understand how these faults affect quantum computations, we conducted a series of experiments to introduce bit flips into the amplitude (both real and imaginary components) and phase values of quantum pulses using IBM's simulated quan- tum environments, FakeValencia, FakeManila, and FakeLima. Our findings reveal that bit flips in the exponent and initial mantissa bits of the real amplitude cause substantial deviations in quantum gate operations, with TVD increases as high as ~200%. Interestingly, the remaining bits exhibited natural tolerance to errors. We proposed a 3-bit repetition error correction code, which effectively reduced the TVD increases to below 40% without incurring any memory overhead. Due to reuse of less significant bits for error correction, the proposed approach introduces maximum of 5-7% extra TVD in nominal cases. However, this can be avoided by sacrificing memory area for implementing the repetition code.</description>

      <title>Small-Scale Testbed for Evaluating C-V2X Applications on 5G Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a small-scale testbed for evaluating the real-life performance of cellular V2X (C-V2X) applications on 5G cellular networks. Despite the growing interest and rapid technology development for V2X applications, researchers still struggle to prototype V2X applications with real wireless networks, hardware, and software in the loop in a controlled environment. To help alleviate this challenge, we present a testbed designed to accelerate development and evaluation of C-V2X applications on 5G cellular networks. By including a small-scale vehicle platform into the testbed design, we significantly reduce the time and effort required to test new C-V2X applications on 5G cellular networks. With a focus around the integration of small-scale vehicle platforms, we detail the design decisions behind the full software and hardware setup of commonly needed intelligent transport system agents (e.g. sensors, servers, vehicles). Moreover, to showcase the testbed's capability to produce industrially-relevant, real world performance evaluations, we present an evaluation of a simple test case inspired from shared situational awareness. Finally, we discuss the upcoming use of the testbed for evaluating 5G cellular network-based shared situational awareness and other C-V2X applications.</description>
