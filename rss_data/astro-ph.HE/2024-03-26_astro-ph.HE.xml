      <title>High-cadence monitoring of the emission properties of magnetar XTE J1810-197 with the Stockert radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [...] We present a singlepulse search method, improving on commonly used neural network classifiers thanks to the filtering of radio frequency interference based on its spectral variance and the magnetar's rotation. With this approach, we were able to lower the signal to noise ratio (S/N) detection threshold from 8 to 5. This allowed us to find over 115,000 spiky single pulses - compared to 56,000 from the neutral network approach. Here, we present the temporal variation of the overall profile and single pulses. Two distinct phases of different single pulse activity can be identified: phase 1 from December 2018 to mid-2019, with a few single pulses per hour, and phase 2 from September 2020 with hundreds of single pulses per hour (with a comparable average flux density). We find that the single pulse properties and folded profile in phase 2 exhibit a change around mid-March 2021. Before this date, the folded profile consists of a single peak and single pulses, with fluences of up to 1000 Jyms and a single-peaked width distribution at around 10 ms. After mid-March 2021, the profile consists of a two peaks and the single pulse population shows a bimodal width distribution with a second peak at 1 ms and fluences of up to 500 Jyms. We also present asymmetries in the phase-resolved single pulse width distributions beginning to appear in 2020, where the pulses arriving earlier in the rotational phase appear wider than those appearing later. This asymmetry persists despite the temporal evolution of the other single pulse and emission properties. We argue that a drift in the emission region in the magnetosphere may explain this observed behaviour. Additionally, we find that the fluence of the detected single pulses depends on the rotational phase and the highest fluence is found in the centre of the peaks in the profile. [...]</description>

      <title>Straightforward mode hierarchy in eccentric binary black hole mergers and associated waveform model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing publicly available non-spinning eccentric binary black hole (BBH) merger simulations (\href{https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/catalog.html}{https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/catalog.html}) from the SXS collaboration~\cite{Hinder:2017sxy}, we present convincing evidence that the waveform phenomenology in eccentric BBH mergers is significantly simpler than previously thought. We find that the eccentric modulations in the amplitudes, phases, and frequencies in different spherical harmonic modes are all related and can be modeled using a single time series modulation. Using this universal eccentric modulation, we provide a model named \texttt{gwNRHME} to seamlessly convert a multi-modal (i.e with several spherical harmonic modes) quasi-circular waveform into multi-modal eccentric waveform if the quadrupolar eccentric waveform is known. This reduces the modelling complexity of eccentric BBH mergers drastically as we now have to model only a single eccentric modulation time-series instead of modelling the effect of eccentricity in all modes. When compared with the NR simulations, our model mismatches are mostly $\sim 10^{-3}$ and are comparable to the numerical errors in the NR simulations. Our method is modular and can be readily added to any quadrupolar non-spinning eccentric waveform model. We make our model publicly available through the \texttt{gwModels} (\href{https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels}{https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels}) waveform package.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking due to multi-angle matter-neutrino resonance in neutron star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star merger remnants are unique sites for exploring neutrino flavor conversion in dense media. Because of the natural excess of $\bar{\nu}_e$ over $\nu_e$, the neutrino-neutrino potential can cancel the matter potential, giving rise to matter-neutrino resonant flavor conversion. Under the assumption of two (anti)neutrino flavors and spatial homogeneity, we solve the neutrino quantum kinetic equations to investigate the occurrence of the matter-neutrino resonance within a multi-angle framework. We find that isotropy is broken spontaneously, regardless of the mass ordering. Relying on a hydrodynamical simulation of a binary neutron star merger remnant with a black hole of $3\ M_\odot$ and an accretion torus of $0.3\ M_\odot$, we find that complete flavor conversion caused by the matter-neutrino resonance is unlikely, although the matter and neutrino potentials cancel at various locations above the disk. Importantly, the matter-neutrino resonant flavor conversion crucially depends on the shape of the neutrino angular distributions. Our findings suggest that an accurate modeling of the neutrino angular distributions is necessary to understand flavor conversion physics in merger remnants, its implications on the disk physics and synthesis of the elements heavier than iron.</description>

      <title>Significant impact of Galactic dark matter particles on annihilation signals from Sagittarius analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the gamma-ray signal from dark matter (DM) annihilation from analogues of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Auriga cosmological simulations. For velocity-dependent annihilation cross sections, we compute emissions from simulated Sgr subhalos and from the Milky Way (MW) foreground. In addition to the annihilation signals from DM particles bound to Sgr, we consider for the first time the annihilation of DM particles bound to the MW that overlap spatially with Sgr. For p-wave models this contribution can enhance the signal by over an order of magnitude, while for d-wave models the enhancement can be over two orders of magnitude. For Sommerfeld models, the corresponding emission decreases by up to nearly an order of magnitude. For Sommerfeld and s-wave models, the Sgr source can be visible above the MW foreground emission, while for p and d-wave models, the signal towards Sgr is most likely dominated by foreground MW emission. We interpret our results within the context of the observed gamma-ray emission from Sgr, finding that the templates from simulations likely have spatial morphology that is too extended to explain the point-like emission that is observed.</description>

      <title>Long term optical variability of two HMXB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the optical light curves of two Be X-ray Binaries, IGR J06074+2205 and SAX J2103.5+4545 recovered from the ATLAS, ZTF and ASAS-SN databases. Both sources show long term optical variability of 620 and 420 days respectively, with color redder when brighter. We suggest that this is due to the precession of the circumstellar disk. Another possibility is the propagation of a density wave in the disk. We remark that only these two sources show a large amplitude, periodic optical variability out of a sample of 16 well studied High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXB) with a Main Sequence primary star.</description>

      <title>Modeling the inner part of the jet in M87: Confronting jet morphology with theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of jets in black hole accretion systems is a long-standing problem. It has been proposed that a jet can be formed by extracting the rotation energy of the black hole ("BZ-jet") or the accretion flow ("disk-jet"). While both models can produce collimated relativistic outflows, neither has successfully explained the observed jet morphology. By employing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and considering nonthermal electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection that is likely driven by magnetic eruption in the underlying accretion flow, we obtain images by radiative transfer calculations and compared them to millimeter observations of the jet in M87. We find that the BZ-jet originating from a magnetically arrested disk around a high-spin black hole can well reproduce the jet morphology, including its width and limb-brightening feature.</description>

      <title>Finding Candidate TeV Halos among Very-High Energy Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for possible pulsar TeV halos among the very-high-energy (VHE) sources reported in different VHE surveys, among which in particular we use the results from the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources. Six candidates are found. They share the properties of containing a middle-aged, gamma-ray--bright pulsar in their positional error circles (the respective pulsars are J0248+6021, J0359+5414, J0622+3749, J0633+0632, J2006+3102, and J2238+5903), being in a rather clean field without any common Galactic VHE-emitting supernova remnants or (bright) pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and showing the absence of any gamma-ray emissions in 0.1--500\,GeV after removing the pulsars' emissions. Combining with several (candidate) TeV halos reported, we find nearly the same relations as previously ones between their luminosities at 50\,TeV, $L_{\rm 50TeV}$, and the corresponding pulsars' spin-down luminosities, $\dot{E}$, which are $L_{\rm 50TeV}\sim \dot{E}^{0.9}$ and $L_{\rm 50TeV}/\dot{E}\sim 6.4\times 10^{-4}$. We probe possible connections between the extension sizes of the VHE sources and the pulsars' ages, and find a weak trend of being older and smaller. By comparing to the VHE detection results for PWNe, it is clear to see that the (candidate) TeV halos have hard emissions by having their power-law indices smaller than 2 in 1--25\,TeV or only being detected in 25--100\,TeV. In addition, we also consider other seven VHE sources as possible TeV halos because of different study results for them, but they do not cleanly fit in the properties listed above, indicating their potential complex nature.</description>

      <title>Chandra and HST studies of the X-ray sources in the Globular Cluster NGC 362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a Chandra observation of the rich globular cluster NGC 362, finding 33 X-ray sources within 1' (1.2 half-mass radii) of the cluster center. Spectral analysis of the brightest source (X1) shows blackbody-like emission, indicating it is likely a quiescent low-mass X-ray binary; we find a possible counterpart that falls in the sub-subgiant region. We use HST UV Globular Cluster Survey (HUGS) photometry to identify 15 potential optical/UV counterparts to these X-ray sources, including two background AGN. We identify no likely CVs, probably due to crowding in optical filters in the core, though we predict of order 8 CVs among the detected X-ray sources. We identify three other sub-subgiants and two red straggler counterparts, which are likely powered by coronal activity, along with five other potential coronally active binary counterparts to three X-ray sources. Finally, we note two unusual counterpart candidates that lie to the red of the red giant branch in V_606 - I_814, and shift well to the blue of the red giant branch in ultraviolet colour-magnitude diagrams. These systems seem to contain a red giant with a distorted evolutionary history, plus a bright blue light source, either a blue straggler star (an Algol-like system) or an accreting white dwarf (a long-period CV, or a symbiotic star).</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars -- Paper I: Structure, shape and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full general relativistic analytic solution for a radiation-pressure supported equilibrium fluid torus orbiting a rotating neutron star (NS). Previously developed analytical methods are thoroughly applied in the Hartle-Thorne geometry, including the effects of both the NS's angular momentum and quadrupole moment. The structure, size and shape of the torus are explored, focusing especially on the critically thick solution - the cusp tori. For the astrophysically relevant range of NS parameters, we examine how our findings differ from those obtained for the Schwarzschild spacetime. The solutions for rotating stars display signatures of the interplay between relativistic and Newtonian effects where the impact of NS angular momentum and quadrupole moment are almost counterbalanced at the given radius. Nevertheless, the spacetime parameters still strongly influence the size of tori, which can be shown in a coordinate-independent way. Finally, we discuss the importance of the size of the central neutron star, determining whether or not the surrounding torus may exist. We provide a set of tools in a Wolfram Mathematica code, which poses a basis allowing for a further investigation of the impact of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state on the spectral and temporal behaviour of accretion tori.</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars -- Paper II: Oscillations and precessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four characteristic oscillation frequencies of accretion flows are, in addition to the Keplerian orbital frequency, often discussed in the context of the time variability of the black hole and neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). These are namely the frequencies of the axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations, and the frequencies of non-axisymmetric oscillations corresponding to the periastron (radial) and Lense-Thirring (vertical) precessions. In this context, we investigate the effect of the quadrupole moment of a slowly rotating NS and provide complete formulae for calculating these oscillation and precession frequencies, as well as their convenient approximations. Simple formulae corresponding to the geodesic limit of a slender torus (and test particle motion) and the limit of a marginally overflowing torus (torus exhibiting a critical cusp) are presented, and furthermore, more general approximate formulae are included to allow calculations for arbitrarily thick tori. We provide the Wolfram Mathematica code used for our calculations together with C++ and PYTHON codes for calculations of the frequencies. Our formulae can be used for various calculations describing the astrophysical signatures of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state. For instance, we demonstrate that, even for a given fixed number of free parameters, a model accounting for fluid flow precession better matches the frequencies of twin-peak quasiperiodic oscillations observed in NS LMXBs than a model using geodesic precession.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harboring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, choked jets have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic signatures is crucial. A choked-jet source is expected harboring in core-collapse supernovae with extended hydrogen envelopes, leading to the release of ultraviolet and optical emission for a few days. The ultraviolet band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future mission satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the chocked source visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic and photohadronic interactions in choked jets, we also investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (as IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with electromagnetic signals coming from shock breakout events. By considering fiducial parameters of the source population and instruments performances, we estimate the maximum redshift up to which ULTRASAT and ZTF are able to detect ultraviolet and optical signals from these explosions, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss coordinated multi-messenger observations among those instruments and high-energy neutrino telescopes. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources enlarging the sample of observed Type II supernovae by around 60%. For optimized multi-messenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at the shock breakout occurrence (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a subsequent follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Accreting Tori: Resolution Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two-dimensional general relativistic radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of accretion disks around non-rotating stellar-mass black hole. We study the evolution of an equilibrium accreting torus in different grid resolutions to determine an adequate resolution to produce a stable turbulent disk driven by magneto-rotational instability. We evaluate the quality parameter, $Q_{\theta}$, from the ratio of MRI wavelength to the grid zone size and examine the effect of resolution in various quantitative values such as the accretion rate, magnetisation, fluxes of physical quantities and disk scale-height. We also analyse how the resolution affects the formation of plasmoids produced in the magnetic reconnection events.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Simulation of the Broad Band X-ray Emission of the Accreting Millisecond X-ray pulsar MAXI J1816-195</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAXI J1816-195 is an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) discovered in 2022. According to the Insight-HXMT data, the pulsations of this source extend all the way to over 100 keV, and its pulse profiles change from a single peak in low-energy range to double peaks in high-energy range. In this work, we simulate its energy spectra and pulse profiles with a Compton scattering Monte Carlo program. The simulation results suggest that the low energy X-ray source on the neutron star surface should be pencil-beamed radiations from the magnetic poles, and there should be a boundary layer in a hollow cylinder shape between the accretion disc and the neutron star surface: the up-scattering of the polar radiations in the boundary layer leads to the double peak structure of the high-energy pulse profile. Under this boundary layer geometry, we suggest that the rarity of AMXPs can be caused by the smearing of the boundary layer. To estimate the mass M and radius R of accretion-powered millisecond pulsars whose surface radiations are badly polluted by the accretion disk and boundary layer, the impact of Compton scattering in the boundary layer on the radiation should be removed before employing the X-ray pulse profile modeling method.</description>

Abstract: Aims. We aim to provide an explanation for the PA rotation in GRBs and find the physical conditions that lead to the rotation by 90 degrees in the toroidal magnetic field (MF) model. Moreover, we present some observable polarization properties in the MF model that can be tested in the future. Results. We find that the PA rotation in the toroidal MF is primarily related to three critical factors: the viewing angle, the jet opening angle, and the jet Lorentz factor. Additionally, the PA can experience twice flips of 90 degrees. The conditions for the flips are $q \gtrsim 0.5$ (except for $q\simeq 1$) and $y_j =(\Gamma \theta_j)^2 \gtrsim 4$. However, the two flips in the PA might not be concurrently observable due to the constraint of flux. Taking these conditions into account and assuming a random orientation between the jet axis and the line of sight (LOS), we obtain a theoretical upper limit (without any constraints) for the observed rate of GRBs in the X-ray or $\gamma$-ray band displaying the flips in PA as $R_{ch} \lesssim 80\%$. We further constrain the observed rate as $R_{ch} \sim 16\%$ according to the maximal post-flip polarized flux level, where the observed rate of single and double flips each account for $\sim 8\%$. Moreover, when the LOS is close to the jet edge ($q\to 1$), it is the easiest case to observe the 90-degree PA flip due to the relatively high post-flip polarized flux level.</description>

      <title>Analysing radio pulsar timing noise with a Kalman filter: a demonstration involving PSR J1359$-$6038</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard two-component crust-superfluid model of a neutron star, timing noise can arise when the two components are perturbed by stochastic torques. Here it is demonstrated how to analyse fluctuations in radio pulse times of arrival with a Kalman filter to measure physical properties of the two-component model, including the crust-superfluid coupling time-scale and the variances of the crust and superfluid torques. The analysis technique, validated previously on synthetic data, is applied to observations with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope of the representative pulsar PSR J1359$-$6038. It is shown that the two-component model is preferred to a one-component model, with log Bayes factor $6.81 \pm 0.02$. The coupling time-scale and the torque variances on the crust and superfluid are measured with $90\%$ confidence to be $10^{7.1^{+0.8}_{-0.5}}$ $\rm{s}$ and $10^{-24.0^{+0.4}_{-5.6}}$ $\rm{rad^2~s^{-3}}$ and $10^{-21.7^{+3.5}_{-0.9}}$ $\rm{rad^2~s^{-3}}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Inferring system parameters from the bursts of the accretion-powered pulsar IGR J17498-2921</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermonuclear (type-I) bursts exhibit properties that depend both on the local surface conditions of the neutron stars on which they ignite, as well as the physical parameters of the host binary system. However, constraining the system parameters requires a comprehensive method to compare the observed bursts to simulations. We have further developed the beansp code for this purpose and analysed the bursts observed from IGR J17498-2921, a 401-Hz accretion-powered pulsar, discovered during it's 2011 outburst. We find good agreement with a model having H-deficient fuel with X = 0.15 +/- 0.4, and CNO metallicity about a tenth of the solar value. The model has the system at a distance of 5.7^{+0.6}_{-0.5} kpc, with a massive (approx. 2 M_sun) neutron star and a likely inclination of 60 deg. We also re-analysed the data from the 2002 outburst of the accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. For that system we find a substantially closer distance than previously inferred, at 2.7 +/- 0.3 kpc, likely driven by a larger degree of burst emission anisotropy. The other system parameters are largely consistent with the previous analysis. We briefly discuss the implications for the evolution of these two systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Clusters from Gaia DR2 as Galactic PeVatrons: I -- Expected Gamma-ray and Neutrino Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young &amp; massive stellar clusters (SCs) are a potential source of galactic cosmic rays up to very high energies as a result of two possible acceleration scenarios. Collective stellar winds from massive member stars form a wind-blown bubble with a termination shock (TS) at which particle acceleration to PeV energies may occur. Furthermore, shock acceleration may occur at SNRs expanding inside the bubble. By applying a model of CR acceleration at both the wind TS and SNR shocks to catalogues of known SCs derived from Gaia DR2, we identify the most promising targets to search for evidence of PeVatron activity. Predictions for the secondary fluxes of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are derived based on particle acceleration at the collective wind TS and the subsequent hadronic interactions with the surrounding medium. Predictions from our modelling under baseline and optimistic scenarios are compared to data, finding consistent results. We estimate the detection prospects for future gamma-ray and neutrino experiments. We find that degree-scale angular sizes of the wind-blown bubbles are typical, that may pose a challenge for experimental detection. A shortlist of the most promising candidates is provided, with an anticipated flux range. Of order 10 SCs may be detectable with future facilities, and 1-5 could be currently operating as PeVatrons. Of these, three gamma-ray detected SCs have data within our predicted range. Our model can consistently describe gamma-ray measurements of SC emission. Several further as-yet-undetected SCs offer promising targets for future observations, although the flux range allowed by our model can be large (&gt; factor 10). The large angular size of the wind-blown bubble may lead to low surface brightness emission, worsening the problem of source confusion. Nevertheless, we discuss how further work will help to constrain SCs as PeVatron candidates. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Self-similar solutions in cylindrical magneto-hydrodynamic blast waves with energy injection at the centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of shocks induced by massive stars does not depend only on the ambient magnetic field strength, but also on its orientation. In the present work, the dynamics of a magnetized blast wave is investigated under the influence of both azimuthal and axial ambient magnetic fields. The blast wave is driven by a central source and forms a shell that results from the accumulation of interstellar matter behind the shock front. A similarity form of the ambient magnetic field and a cylindrical geometry of the blast wave are assumed to obtain self-similar solutions. The model is studied separately for both azimuthal and axial magnetic field and applied to stellar wind bubbles and supernova remnants respectively, using 1D numerical simulations. We found that the magnetized blast wave differs from the self-similar case without an ambient magnetic field. The forward shock front goes slower in the azimuthal case and faster in the axial one. For both tangential orientations, the thickness of the shell increases with the magnetic strength. In the azimuthal case, the thermal energy can be converted to magnetic energy near the inner boundary of the shell. Thus, the temperature drops and the magnetic field increases at the tangential discontinuity of the stellar wind bubble. In the axial case of a supernova remnant, the numerical solution al w ays follows a special curve in the parameter space given by the self-similar model.</description>

      <title>Polarisation properties of X-ray emission from accreting supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation elaborates on X-ray polarisation features of astrophysical environments near accreting black holes. Although the work was originally assigned to supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei, the results are also largely applicable to stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems. Several numerical models predicting the X-ray polarisation from these sources are presented, including their immediate applications in the interpretation of the latest discoveries achieved thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission that began operating in December 2021. The modeling ranges from radiative transfer effects in atmospheres of accretion discs to general-relativistic signatures of X-rays travelling in vacuum near the central black holes to reprocessing events in distant, circumnuclear components. Various scales in physical and computational complexity are examined. A unifying element of this dissertation is the focus on reflection of X-rays from partially ionized matter.</description>

      <title>Unveiling extended gamma-ray emission around HESS J1813-178</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HESS J1813$-$178 is a very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray source spatially coincident with the young and energetic pulsar PSR J1813$-$1749 and thought to be associated with its pulsar wind nebula (PWN). Recently, evidence for extended high-energy emission in the vicinity of the pulsar has been revealed in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. This motivates revisiting the HESS J1813$-$178 region, taking advantage of improved analysis methods and an extended data set. Using data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) experiment and the Fermi-LAT, we aim to describe the $\gamma$-ray emission in the region with a consistent model, to provide insights into its origin. We performed a likelihood-based analysis on 32 hours of H.E.S.S. data and 12 years of Fermi-LAT data and fit a spectro-morphological model to the combined datasets. These results allowed us to develop a physical model for the origin of the observed $\gamma$-ray emission in the region. In addition to the compact very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission centered on the pulsar, we find a significant yet previously undetected component along the Galactic plane. With Fermi-LAT data, we confirm extended high-energy emission consistent with the position and elongation of the extended emission observed with H.E.S.S. These results establish a consistent description of the emission in the region from GeV energies to several tens of TeV. This study suggests that HESS J1813$-$178 is associated with a $\gamma$-ray PWN powered by PSR J1813$-$1749. A possible origin of the extended emission component is inverse Compton emission from electrons and positrons that have escaped the confines of the pulsar and form a halo around the PWN.</description>

      <title>Contribution of neutrino-dominated accretion flows to cosmic MeV neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) are one of the important MeV neutrino sources and significantly contribute to the cosmic diffuse neutrino background. In this paper, we investigate the spectrum of diffuse NDAF neutrino background (DNNB) by fully considering the effects of the progenitor properties and initial explosion energies based on core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations, and estimate the detectable event rate by Super-Kamiokande detector. We find that the predicted background neutrino flux is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the diffuse flux of DNNB is comparable to the diffuse supernova neutrino background, which might be detected by the upcoming larger neutrino detectors such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, and DUNE. Moreover, the strong outflows from NDAFs could dramatically decrease their contribution to the neutrino background.</description>

      <title>Quantitative modelling of type Ia supernovae spectral time series: Constraining the explosion physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple explosion mechanisms have been proposed to explain type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Through forward modelling, synthetic observables of explosion models can be directly compared to observations of SNe Ia to constrain the explosion physics. Due to the computational expense associated with multi-dimensional explosion and radiative transfer simulations however, empirical modelling tools have also been developed that allow for fast, customised modelling of individual SNe. Such tools have provided useful insights, but the subjective nature with which empirical modelling is performed makes it difficult to obtain robust constraints on the explosion physics or expand studies to large populations of objects. Machine learning accelerated tools have therefore begun to gain traction. In this paper, we present riddler, a framework for automated fitting of SNe Ia spectral sequences up to shortly after maximum light. We train a series of neural networks on realistic ejecta profiles predicted by the W7 and N100 explosion models to emulate full radiative transfer simulations and apply nested sampling to determine the best-fitting model parameters for multiple spectra of a given SN simultaneously. We show that riddler is able to accurately recover the parameters of input spectra and use it to fit observations of two well-studied SNe Ia. We also investigate the impact of different weighting schemes when performing quantitative spectral fitting. As spectroscopic samples of SNe Ia continue to grow, automated spectral fitting tools such as riddler will become increasingly important to maximise the physical constraints that can be gained in a quantitative and consistent manner.</description>

      <title>The Tarantula $-$ Revealed by X-rays (T-ReX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus) is the most important star-forming complex in the Local Group, offering a microscope on starburst astrophysics. At its heart lies the exceptionally rich young stellar cluster R136, containing the most massive stars known. Stellar winds and supernovae have carved 30 Dor into an amazing display of arcs, pillars, and bubbles. We present first results and advanced data processing products from the 2-Ms Chandra X-ray Visionary Project, "The Tarantula $-$ Revealed by X-rays" (T-ReX). The 3615 point sources in the T-ReX catalog include massive stars, compact objects, binaries, bright pre-main-sequence stars and compact young stellar (sub)clusters in 30 Dor. After removing point sources and excluding the exceptionally bright supernova remnant N157B (30 Dor B), the global diffuse X-ray maps reveal hot plasma structures resolved at 1$-$10 pc scales, with an absorption-corrected total-band (0.5$-$7 keV) X-ray luminosity of $2.110\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Spatially-resolved spectral modeling provides evidence for emission lines enhanced by charge-exchange processes at the interfaces. We identify a candidate for the oldest X-ray pulsar detected to date in 30 Dor, PSR J0538-6902, inside a newly-resolved arctuate X-ray wind nebula, the Manta Ray. The long time baseline of T-ReX monitored dozens of massive stars, several showing periodic variability tied to binary orbital periods, and captured strong flares from at least three low-mass Galactic foreground stars.</description>

      <title>Generation of narrow beams of super high-energy gamma quanta in the resonant inverse Compton-effect in the field of a strong x-ray wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>The First High-Contrast Images of Near High-Mass X-Ray Binaries with Keck/NIRC2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the study of X-ray binaries has led to major breakthroughs in high-energy astrophysics, their circumbinary environment at scales of $\sim$100--10,000 astronomical units has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we undertake a novel and exploratory study by employing direct and high-contrast imaging techniques on a sample of X-ray binaries, using adaptive optics and the vortex coronagraph on Keck/NIRC2. High-contrast imaging opens up the possibility to search for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, circumbinary companion stars, and protoplanetary disks in these extreme systems. Here, we present the first near-infrared high-contrast images of 13 high-mass X-ray binaries located within $\sim$2--3 kpc. The key results of this campaign involve the discovery of several candidate circumbinary companions ranging from sub-stellar (brown dwarf) to stellar masses. By conducting an analysis based on galactic population models, we discriminate sources that are likely background/foreground stars and isolate those that have a high probability ($\gtrsim 60 - 99\%$) of being gravitationally bound to the X-ray binary. This publication seeks to establish a preliminary catalog for future analyses of proper motion and subsequent observations. With our preliminary results, we calculate the first estimate of the companion frequency and the multiplicity frequency for X-ray binaries: $\approx$0.6 and 1.8 $\pm$ 0.9 respectively, considering only the sources that are most likely bound to the X-ray binary. In addition to extending our comprehension of how brown dwarfs and stars can form and survive in such extreme systems, our study opens a new window to our understanding of the formation of X-ray binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint to explain the experimental data of neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for all those experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path.</description>

Abstract: Radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies are prominent reservoirs of magnetic fields and of non-thermal particles, which get mixed with the intracluster medium. We review the observational and theoretical knowledge of the role of these crucial ingredients for the formation of diffuse radio emission in clusters (radio halos, relics, mini halos) and outline the open questions in this field.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic stellar structure in the Fierz--Pauli theory and generic linear massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of static spherical stars composed of non-relativistic matter in linear massive gravity with or without the Fierz-Pauli (FP) tuning. Adopting a polytropic equation of state, we construct master differential equations for the stellar profile function, which is fourth order in the FP theory or sixth order in generic non-FP theories, where the difference in the differential order reflects the presence of a ghost spin-0 graviton in the latter. In both cases, even when the spin-0 ghost is present, we find exact solutions with finite radius for the polytropic indices n = 0 and 1. Analyzing the dependences of the stellar radius, mass, and Yukawa charge on the graviton masses, we observe that a discontinuous behavior arises in the massless limit of the FP theory similarly to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity, while it is absent in non-FP theories. We discuss rough observational constraints on the graviton masses.</description>

      <title>SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses; this result is uniquely enabled by our semi-analytical approach. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations.

      <title>The interacting double white dwarf population with LISA; stochastic foreground and resolved sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of tidal torques and mass transfer on the population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that will be observed with LISA. Starting from a distribution of DWDs at formation predicted by numerical simulations, we use a semi-analytical model to evolve DWDs under different hypotheses for the efficiency of tidal coupling and the birth spins of white dwarfs. We then estimate the stochastic foreground and the population of resolvable binaries for LISA in each scenario. Our predicted DWD binary distribution can differ substantially from the distribution expected if only gravitational waves (GWs) are considered. If white dwarfs spin slowly, then we predict an excess of systems around a few mHz, due to binaries that outspiral after the onset of mass transfer. This excess of systems leads to differences in the confusion noise, which are most pronounced for strong tidal coupling. In that case, we find a significantly higher number of resolvable binaries than in the GW-only scenario. If instead white dwarfs spin rapidly and tidal coupling is weak, then we find no excess around a few mHz, and the confusion noise due to DWDs is very small. In that scenario, we also predict a subpopulation of outspiralling binaries below 0.1 mHz. Using the Fisher matrix approximation, we estimate the uncertainty on the GW-frequency derivative of resolvable systems. We estimate that, even for non-accreting systems, the mismodelling error due to neglect of effects other than GWs is larger than the statistical uncertainty, and thus this neglect would lead to biased estimates for mass and distance. Our results highlight the need for flexible tools in LISA data analysis. Because our semi-analytical model hinges upon a simplistic approach to determining the stability of mass accretion it will be important to deepen our comprehension of stability in mass-transferring DWD binaries.</description>

      <title>Generic gravito-magnetic clock effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that two counter-orbiting clocks around a spinning mass differ in the time required to complete the same orbit. The difference in these two values for the orbital period is generally referred to as the gravito-magnetic (GM) clock effect. It has been proposed to measure the GM clock effect using atomic clocks carried by satellites in prograde and retrograde orbits around the Earth. The precision and stability required for satellites to accurately perform this measurement remains a challenge for current instrumentation. One of the most accurate clocks in the Universe is a millisecond pulsar, which emits periodic radio pulses with high stability. Timing of the pulsed signals from millisecond pulsars has proven to be very successful in testing predictions of general relativity and the GM clock effect is potentially measurable in binary systems. In this work we derive the generic GM clock effect by considering a slowly-spinning binary system on an elliptical orbit, with both arbitrary mass ratio and arbitrary spin orientations. The spin-orbit interaction introduces a perturbation to the orbit, causing the orbital plane to precess and nutate. We identify several different contributions to the clock effects: the choice of spin supplementary condition and the observer-dependent definition of a full revolution and "nearly-identical" orbits. We discuss the impact of these subtle definitions on the formula for GM clock effects and show that most of the existing formulae in the literature can be recovered under appropriate assumptions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic fluctuations and topological susceptibility in chiral magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnetohydrodynamics is devoted to understanding the late-time and long-distance behavior of a system with an Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly at finite temperatures. The non-conservation of the axial charge is determined by the topological density $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$; in a classical hydrodynamic description this decay rate can be suppressed by tuning the background magnetic field to zero. However it is in principle possible for thermal fluctuations of $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$ to result in a non-conservation of the charge even at vanishing $B$-field; this would invalidate the classical hydrodynamic effective theory. We investigate this by computing the real-time susceptibility of the topological density at one-loop level in magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations, relating its low-frequency limit to the decay rate of the axial charge. We find that the frequency-dependence of this susceptibility is sufficiently soft as to leave the axial decay rate unaffected, validating the classical hydrodynamic description. We show that the susceptibility contains non-analytic frequency-dependence which is universally determined by hydrodynamic data. We comment briefly on possible connections to the recent formulation of the ABJ anomaly in terms of non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.10042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The jets of SS 433 have punched through the supernova remnant from the explosion forming the compact object. The precessing jets collimate before reaching beyond the shell, some 40 pc downstream, just the region of origin of TeV gamma radiation. Collimation could be effected by ambient pressure in the SNR cavity; I investigate conditions under which W50 morphology and the origins of TeV gamma radiation can be explained in terms of collimation, with associated shocks, induced by ambient pressure. I consider the age of the SNR and hence the present ambient pressure. The cavity is now ~ 10^5 years after the supernova; with lower pressure, collimation and associated shocks would occur ~40 pc downstream, just the origin of TeV gamma radiation. Modelling of evolution of binary systems indicates that Roche lobe overflow and initiation of the jets is recent. Collimation would still occur ~40 pc downstream, but the cone angle of the precession must then have increased with time - driven by the Roche lobe overflow. The morphology of W50 and the site of the origin of TeV gamma radiation are readily explained in terms of collimation of the jets by internal SNR pressure.</description>

      <title>Simulating gamma-ray production from cosmic rays interacting with the solar atmosphere in the presence of coronal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays can interact with the solar atmosphere and produce a slew of secondary messengers, making the Sun a bright gamma-ray source in the sky. Detailed observations with Fermi-LAT have shown that these interactions must be strongly affected by solar magnetic fields in order to produce the wide range of observational features, such as high flux and hard spectrum. However, the detailed mechanisms behind these features are still a mystery. In this work, we tackle this problem by performing particle interaction simulations in the solar atmosphere in the presence of coronal magnetic fields modelled using the potential field source surface (PFSS) model. We find that the low-energy (~GeV) gamma-ray production is significantly enhanced by the coronal magnetic fields, but the enhancement decreases rapidly with energy. The enhancement is directly correlated with the production of gamma rays with large deviation angles relative to the input cosmic-ray direction. We conclude that coronal magnetic fields are essential for correctly modeling solar disk gamma rays below 10GeV, but above that the effect of coronal magnetic fields diminishes. Other magnetic field structures are needed to explain the high-energy disk emission.</description>

      <title>Evidence for gamma-ray emission from the remnant of Kepler's supernova based on deep H.E.S.S. observations</title>

Abstract: Observations with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have enhanced our knowledge of nearby supernova (SN) remnants with ages younger than 500 years by establishing Cassiopeia A and the remnant of Tycho's SN as very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources. The remnant of Kepler's SN, which is the product of the most recent naked-eye supernova in our Galaxy, is comparable in age to the other two, but is significantly more distant. If the gamma-ray luminosities of the remnants of Tycho's and Kepler's SNe are similar, then the latter is expected to be one of the faintest gamma-ray sources within reach of the current generation IACT arrays.
  Here we report evidence at a statistical level of 4.6 sigma for a VHE signal from the remnant of Kepler's SN based on deep observations by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) with an exposure of 152 hours. The measured integral flux above an energy of 226 GeV is ~0.3% of the flux of the Crab Nebula. The spectral energy distribution (SED) reveals a gamma-ray emitting component connecting the VHE emission observed with H.E.S.S. to the emission observed at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT. The overall SED is similar to that of the remnant of Tycho's SN, possibly indicating the same non-thermal emission processes acting in both these young remnants of thermonuclear SNe.</description>

      <title>Space-based Gravitational Wave Observatories Will Be Able to Use Eccentricity to Unveil Stellar-mass Binary Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of eccentricity would provide strong constraints on the formation channel of stellar-mass binary black holes. However, current ground-based gravitational wave detectors will, in most cases, not be able to measure eccentricity due to orbital circularization. Space-based observatories, in contrast, can determine binary eccentricity at 0.01Hz to $e_{0.01}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}) $. Directly observing stellar-mass binary black holes with space-based observatories remains a challenging problem. However, observing such systems with ground-based detectors allows the possibility to identify the same signal in archival data from space-based observatories in the years previous. Since ground-based detectors provide little constraints on eccentricity, including eccentricity in the archival search will increase the required number of filter waveforms for the archival search by 5 orders of magnitudes [from $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3)$ to $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^8)$], and will correspondingly need $ \sim8\times10^5 $ core hours (and $ \sim 10^5$ GB of memory), even for a mild upper limit on eccentricity of $0.1$. In this work, we have constructed the first template bank for an archival search of space-based gravitational wave detectors, including eccentricity. We have demonstrated that even though the inclusion of eccentricity brings extra computational burden, an archival search including eccentricity will be feasible in the time frame of planned space-based observatories, and will provide strong constraints on the eccentricities of stellar-mass binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Bent Jet Structure and Polarization of OJ 287 at 1.7 GHz with Space VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present total intensity and linear polarization images of OJ287 at 1.68GHz, obtained through space-based VLBI observations with RadioAstron on April 16, 2016. The observations were conducted using a ground array consisting of the VLBA and the EVN. Ground-space fringes were detected with a maximum projected baseline length of 5.6 Earth's diameter, resulting in an angular resolution of 530 uas. With this unprecedented resolution at such a low frequency, the progressively bending jet structure of OJ287 has been resolved up to 10 pc of the projected distance from the radio core. In comparison with close-in-time VLBI observations at 15, 43, 86 GHz from MOJAVE and VLBA-BU-BLAZAR monitoring projects, we obtain the spectral index map showing the opaque core and optically thin jet components. The optically thick core has a brightness temperature of 10$^{13}$ K, and is further resolved into two sub-components at higher frequencies labeled C1 and C2. These sub-components exhibit a transition from optically thick to thin, with a SSA turnover frequency estimated to be 33 and 11.5 GHz, and a turnover flux density 4 and 0.7 Jy, respectively. Assuming a Doppler boosting factor of 10, the SSA values provide the estimate of the magnetic field strengths from SSA of 3.4 G for C1 and 1.0 G for C2. The magnetic field strengths assuming equipartition arguments are also estimated as 2.6 G and 1.6 G, respectively. The integrated degree of linear polarization is found to be approximately 2.5 %, with the electric vector position angle being well aligned with the local jet direction at the core region. This alignment suggests a predominant toroidal magnetic field, which is in agreement with the jet formation model that requires a helical magnetic field anchored to either the black hole ergosphere or the accretion disk. Further downstream, the jet seems to be predominantly threaded by a poloidal magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Testing a new general diffractive formula with gravitational wave source lensed by a supermassive black hole in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For long wavelength gravitational wave (GW), it is easy to diffract when it is lensed by celestial objects. Traditional diffractive integral formula has ignored large angle diffraction, which is adopted in most of cases. However, in some special cases (e. g. a GW source lensed by a supermassive black hole in a binary system, where the lens is close to the source), large angle diffraction could be important. Our previous works have proposed a new general diffractive integral formula which is also valid for large angle diffraction case. In this paper, we have investigated how much difference between this general diffractive formula and traditional diffractive integral formula could be under these special cases with different parameters. We find that the module of amplification factor for general diffractive formula could become smaller than that of traditional diffractive integral basically with a factor $r_F\simeq0.806$ when the distance between lens and sources is $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU and lens mass $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$. Their difference is so significant that it is detectable. Furthermore, we find that the proportionality factor $r_F$ is gradually increasing from 0.5 to 1 with increasing $D_{\rm LS}$ and it is decreasing with increasing $M_{\rm L}$. As long as $D_{\rm LS}\lesssim0.2$ AU (with $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$) or $M_{\rm L}\gtrsim2\times10^6M_\odot$ (with $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU ), the difference between new and traditional formulas is enough significant to be detectable. It is promising to test this new general diffractive formula in the future GW detection.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from JWST and NANOGrav</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the recent statistics of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data at $z \sim 3.4$ to address two aspects of the feedback and evolution scenarios of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). We find that the JWST data provide evidence for the members of a binary black hole being 'lit' at the same time, rather than independently -- a scenario which is consistent with gas-rich mergers being responsible for concurrent AGN activity. This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Gamma-ray Emission Properties of the Globular Cluster M5 with the Fermi-LAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyzed the globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) using 15 years of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using rotation ephemerides generated from Arecibo and FAST radio telescope observations, we searched for gamma-ray pulsations from the seven millisecond pulsars (MSPs) identified in M5. We detected no significant pulsations from any of the individual pulsars. Also, we searched for possible variations of the gamma-ray emission as a function of orbital phase for all the six MSPs in binary systems, but did not detect any significant modulations. The gamma-ray emission from the direction of M5 is well described by an exponentially cutoff power-law spectral model, although other models cannot be excluded. The phase-averaged emission is consistent with being steady on a time scale of a few months. We estimate the number of MSPs in M5 to be between 1 and 10, using the gamma-ray conversion efficiencies for well-characterized gamma-ray MSPs in the Third Fermi Large Area Telescope Catalog of Gamma-ray Pulsars, suggesting that the sample of known MSPs in M5 is (nearly) complete, even if it is not currently possible to rule out a diffuse component of the observed gamma rays from the cluster.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic observations of progenitor activity 100 days before a Type Ibn supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining spectroscopic observations of the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae is often unfeasible due to an inherent lack of knowledge as to which stars will go supernova and when they will explode. In this letter, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the progenitor activity of SN 2023fyq in the preceding 150 days before the He-rich progenitor exploded as a Type Ibn supernova. The progenitor of SN 2023fyq shows an exponential rise in flux prior to core-collapse. Complex He I emission line features are observed, with a P-Cygni like profile, as well as an evolving broad base with velocities on the order of 10,000 km/s, possibly due to electron scattering. The luminosity and evolution of SN 2023fyq are consistent with a faint Type Ibn, reaching a peak r-band magnitude of 18.1 mag, although there is some uncertainty in the distance to the host, NGC 4388, located in the Virgo cluster. We present additional evidence of asymmetric He-rich material being present prior to the explosion of SN 2023fyq, as well as after, suggesting this material has survived the ejecta-CSM interaction. Broad [O I] and the Ca II triplet lines are observed at late phases, confirming that SN 2023fyq was a genuine supernova rather than a non-terminal interacting transient. SN 2023fyq provides insight into the final moments of a massive star's life, highlighting that the progenitor is likely highly unstable before core-collapse.</description>

      <title>An in-depth analysis of the variable cyclotron lines in GX 301$-$2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) system GX 301$-$2 is a persistent source with a well-known variable cyclotron line centered at 35 keV. Recently, a second cyclotron line at 50 keV has been reported with a presumably different behavior than the 35 keV line.
  Aims. We investigate the presence of the newly discovered cyclotron line in the phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra at higher luminosities than before. We further aim to determine the pulse-phase variability of both lines.
  Methods. We analyze a NuSTAR observation of GX 301$-$2 covering the pre-periastron flare, where the source luminosity reached its peak of ${\sim} 4 \times 10^{37}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in the 5-50 keV range. We analyze the phase-averaged spectra in the NuSTAR energy range from 3.5-79 keV for both the complete observation and three time segments of it. We further analyze the phase-resolved spectra and the pulse-phase variability of continuum and cyclotron line parameters.
  Results. We confirm that the description of the phase-averaged spectrum requires a second absorption feature at $51.5^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ keV besides the established line at 35 keV. The statistical significance of this feature in the phase-averaged spectrum is $&gt;99.999\%$. We further find that the 50 keV cyclotron line is present in three of eight phase bins.
  Conclusions. Based on the results of our analysis, we confirm that the detected absorption feature is very likely to be a cyclotron line. We discuss a variety of physical scenarios which could explain the proposed anharmonicity, but also outline circumstances under which the lines are harmonically related. We further present the cyclotron line history of GX 301$-$2 and evaluate concordance among each other. We also discuss an alternative spectral model including cyclotron line emission wings.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moments of Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of neutrino magnetic moments on astrophysical neutrinos, in particular supernova neutrinos and ultra-high energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources. We show that magnetic moment-induced conversion of left-handed neutrinos into unobservable right-handed singlet states can substantially change the flux and flavour composition of these neutrinos at Earth. Notably, neutrinos from a supernova's neutronisation burst, whose flux can be predicted with O(10%) accuracy, offer a discovery reach to neutrino magnetic moments $\sim \text{few} \times 10^{-13} \mu_B$, up to one order of magnitude below current limits. For high-energy neutrinos from distant sources, for which no robust flux prediction exists, we show how the flavour composition at Earth can be used as a handle to establish the presence of non-negligible magnetic moments, potentially down to $\text{few} \times 10^{-17} \mu_B$ if the measurement can be performed on neutrinos from a single source. In both cases, the sensitivity strongly depends on the galactic resp. intergalactic magnetic field profiles along the line of sight. Therefore, while a discovery is possible down to very small values of the magnetic moment, the absence of a discovery does not imply an equally strong limit. We also comment on the dependence of our results on the right-handed neutrino mass, paying special attention to the transition from coherent deflection by a classical magnetic field to incoherent scattering on individual scattering targets. Finally, we show that a measurement of Standard Model Dirac neutrino magnetic moments, of order $10^{-19} \mu_B$, could be possible under rather optimistic, but not completely outrageous, assumptions using flavour ratios of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Thermal phonon fluctuations and stability of the magnetic dual chiral density wave phase in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability against thermal phonon fluctuations of the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase, an inhomogeneous phase arising in cold dense QCD in a magnetic field. Following a recent study that demonstrated the absence of the Landau-Peierls (LP) instability from this phase, we calculate the (threshold) temperature at which the phonon fluctuations wash out the long-range order over a range of magnetic fields and densities relevant to astrophysical applications. Using a high-order Ginzburg-Landau expansion, we find that the threshold temperature is very near the critical temperature for fields of order $10^{18}$ G, and still a sizable fraction of the critical temperature for fields of order $10^{17}$ G. Therefore, at sufficiently large magnetic fields, the long-range order of the MDCDW phase is preserved over most of the parameter space where it is energetically favored; at smaller magnetic fields, the long-range order is still preserved over a considerable region of parameter space relevant to compact stars. We provide general symmetry arguments to explain why a magnetic field alone is not enough to eliminate the LP instability that characterizes single-modulated phases in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are well-motivated and actively searched for new particles that would mix with the active neutrinos. We study their phenomenology when they are produced in the evaporation of early Universe black holes, a novel production mechanism that differs from all others and does not depend on the active-sterile mixing. The resulting hotter sterile neutrinos have a distinct spectrum and could be warm dark matter in the 0.3 MeV to 0.3 TeV mass range, distinct from the typical keV range. The possible coincidence of X-rays and gravitational waves is a unique novel signature of our scenario.</description>

      <title>Which first order phase transitions to quark matter are possible in neutron stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine which first order phase transitions are consistent with today's astrophysical constraints. In particular, we explore how a well-constrained mass-radius data point would restrict the admissible parameter space and to this end, we employ the most likely candidates of the recent NICER limits of PSR J0030+0451. To systematically vary the stiffness of the equation of state, we employ a parameterizable relativistic mean field equation of state, which is in compliance with results from chiral effective field theory. We model phase transitions via Maxwell constructions and parameterize them by means of the transitional pressure $p_{\rm trans}$ and the jump in energy density $\Delta\epsilon$. This provides us with a generic setup that allows for rather general conclusions to be drawn. We outline some regions in the $p_{\rm trans}$-$\Delta\epsilon$ parameter space that may allow for a phase transition identification in the near future. We also find that a strongly constrained data point, at either exceptionally large or small radii, would reduce the parameter space to such an extent that mass and radius become insufficient indicators of a phase transition.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&lt; -1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Global Analysis of LISA Data with Galactic Binaries and Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA Data Challenge 2a is focused on robust signal extraction from a blend of these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and estimate the noise of the residual. We perform the pipeline in a time-evolving weekly analysis starting with an observation time of 1 week until we reach a full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument noise with each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple massive black hole binaries. Additionally, we demonstrate a massive black hole binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.</description>
