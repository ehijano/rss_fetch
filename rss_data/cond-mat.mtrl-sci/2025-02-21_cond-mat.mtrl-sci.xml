      <title>The origin and scarcity of breathing pyrochlore lattices in spinel oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breathing pyrochlores are a unique class of materials characterized by a three-dimensional lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra. However, unlike conventional pyrochlores where all tetrahedra are identical in size, the breathing pyrochlore lattice is composed of alternating large and small tetrahedra. Experimental realizations of the breathing pyrochlore lattice are rare but they do occur in $A$-site ordered spinels, as in the prototype materials LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$. In this work, we demonstrate that Cr cannot be straightforwardly substituted with other magnetic transition metals while retaining the breathing pyrochlore structure. To explain this observation, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the formation and stability of LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$, focusing on the energy scales associated with $A$ and $B$-site orderings as well as the magnetic exchange interactions of Cr ions. We identify the strong octahedral site preference of Cr$^{3+}$ as a key factor in protecting the structural integrity of the pyrochlore sublattice, which in turn enables the breathing distortion to proceed. We also demonstrate that the charge order between the $A$ (Li) and $A'$ sites (Ga or In) is maintained at all temperatures up to decomposition. Furthermore, while the magnetic exchange interactions constitute a relatively small energy scale and therefore do not play a fundamental role in the structural stability of LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$, magnetism may play a critical role in setting the magnitude of the tetrahedral distortion. Ultimately, we conclude that the scarcity of breathing pyrochlores is a consequence of the stringent requirement on site ordering for their formation.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-Tunable Localization of Simultaneous Type I and Type II Band Alignment in a MoSe2/WS2 Heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e heterobilayers exhibiting spatially varying band alignment and electron and hole localization that can be precisely controlled through the twist angle have emerged as exciting platforms for studying complex quantum phenomena. While most heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have a type II band alignment, the introduction of type I band alignment could enable stronger light-matter coupling and enhanced radiative emission. Here, we show through a combination of first-principles GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) calculations and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) measurements that contrary to previous understanding, the MoSe2/WS2 heterobilayer has a type I band alignment at large twist angles and simultaneous regions of type I and type II band alignment due to the structural reconstruction in different high symmetry regions at small twist angles. In tr-ARPES, consistent with our calculations, a long-lived electron population is only observed in MoSe2 for samples with large twist angles, while in samples with small twist angles, signals from two distinct long-lived excitons are observed. Moreover, despite the near degeneracy of the conduction bands of the two layers, no excitonic hybridization occurs, suggesting that previously observed absorption peaks in this material arise from lattice reconstruction. Our findings clarify the complex energy landscape in MoSe2/WS2 heterostructures, where the coexistence of type I and type II band alignment opens the door to moir\'e-tunable optoelectronic devices with intrinsic lateral heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Fast spin precession and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ferrimagnetic Mn4N thin films improved by Pd buffer layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets take the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets making them promise for spintronic applications. Here we prepared ferrimagnetic Mn4N thin films with high Curie temperature and investigated the crystalline structure and magnetic properties affected by the Pd buffer layer. We demonstrated that both crystalline quality and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of Mn4N thin films are enhanced significantly due to the relaxation of tensile stress induced by the Pd buffer layer. We also demonstrated a fast spin precession at room temperature, almost 100 GHz, in Mn4N thin films. With the characteristics of high thermal stability, enhanced PMA by buffer layer and fast spin precession, Mn4N thin film is a promising material for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Higher-order skyrmion crystal in van der Waals Kitaev triangular antiferromagnet NiI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, hold great promise for spintronics applications. However, most known skyrmion systems are restricted to a topological charge of one and require an external magnetic field for stabilization. Here, we report the discovery of a skyrmion crystal with a topological number of two in an insulating van der Waals magnet NiI2. We unveil the static and dynamic magnetic correlations across three temperature-driven magnetic phases using neutron scattering measurements, simulations, and model optimisation. By employing a minimal Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we reproduce the experimentally observed excitations and confirm the emergence of the higher-order skyrmion crystal through Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, this exotic phase arises without the need for a magnetic field, presenting a novel platform for controlling complex spin textures in an accessible material. These findings establish NiI2 as a pivotal material, bridging fundamental quantum magnetism with advancements in skyrmionics and multiferroic technologies.</description>

      <title>OBELiX: A Curated Dataset of Crystal Structures and Experimentally Measured Ionic Conductivities for Lithium Solid-State Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to replace liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical energy density and improved safety. However, their adoption is currently hindered by their lower effective ionic conductivity, a quantity that governs charge and discharge rates. Identifying highly ion-conductive materials using conventional theoretical calculations and experimental validation is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. While machine learning holds the promise to expedite this process, relevant ionic conductivity and structural data is scarce. Here, we present OBELiX, a domain-expert-curated database of $\sim$600 synthesized solid electrolyte materials and their experimentally measured room temperature ionic conductivities gathered from literature. Each material is described by their measured composition, space group and lattice parameters. A full-crystal description in the form of a crystallographic information file (CIF) is provided for ~320 structures for which atomic positions were available. We discuss various statistics and features of the dataset and provide training and testing splits that avoid data leakage. Finally, we benchmark seven existing ML models on the task of predicting ionic conductivity and discuss their performance. The goal of this work is to facilitate the use of machine learning for solid-state electrolyte materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'{e} sphere engineering of dynamical ferroelectric topological solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric representation lays the basis for understanding and flexible tuning of topological transitions in many physical systems. An example is given by the Poincar\'{e} sphere (PS) that provides an intuitive and continuous parameterization of the spin or orbital angular momentum (OAM) light states. Here, we apply this geometric construction to understand and continuously encode dynamical topologies of ferroelectric solitons driven by OAM-tunable light. We show that: (1) PS engineering enables controlled creation of dynamic polar antiskyrmions that are rarely found in ferroelectrics; (2) We link such topological transition to the tuning of the light beam as a ``knob'' from OAM (PS pole) to non-OAM (PS equator) modes; (3) Intermediate OAM-state structured light results in new ferroelectric topologies of temporally hybrid skyrmion-antiskyrmion states. Our study offers new approaches of robust control and flexible tuning of topologies of matter using structured light.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Optical and Thermodynamic Properties of 2D MoGe2P4 : Potential Material for Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed the optical, thermodynamic and electronic properties of 2D MoGe2P4 from the first principle calculation. 2D MoGe2P4 demonstrates superior optical absorption in the NIR-I biological window (750 nm ~ 1000 nm) with a peak near 808 nm and excellent thermal conductivity (63 Wm-1K-1). Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and Heat simulations demonstrate that 2D MoGe2P4 possesses efficient photothermal conversion under low laser power (0.5 W/cm2) which is operated in 808nm. Theoretical investigation demonstrates, rapid temperature elevation ({\Delta}T = 24.8 {\deg}C) of the 2D MoGe2P4 within two minutes and photothermal stability over multiple laser cycles, achieving temperatures suitable for effective photothermal therapeutic applications. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an emerging tumor treatment technique that utilizes photothermal agents (PTAs) to convert near-infrared (NIR) light into localized heat for tumor ablation. To enhance biocompatibility, we analyzed the PEGylation of 2D MoGe2P4 nanosheets through molecular dynamics simulation. PEGylation at human body temperature was stable which signifies 2D MoGe2P4's prospect in therapeutic applications. This research highlights the potential of 2D MoGe2P4 as an emerging material for PTA, establishing a foundation for experimental and clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Twinning in ferromagnetic Heusler Rh2MnSb epitaxial thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxially grown full Heusler alloy of Rh2MnSb thin films were prepared for the first time using DC magnetron sputtering. The films were deposited on MgO [001] substrates with a deposition temperature of 600{\deg}C, 700{\deg}C, and 800{\deg}C. We report the structural, morphological, optical, magneto-optical, and magnetic properties of the films with a 200 nm nominal thickness. The grown-at-600{\deg}C film was close to stoichiometric and exhibited L21 ordering typical for Heusler alloys. The single-phase Rh2MnSb film had a tetragonal structure with lattice parameters close to the bulk material. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the metallic character of the film free from contamination. The tetragonal films exhibited discernible regular twinning with the majority of twin domains with the c-axis perpendicular to the surface due to a substrate constraint. The twin formation was studied by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy and by X-ray diffraction. Magnetic measurements showed TC of about 220-275 K and saturation magnetization of about 55 emu/g, close to the bulk material. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements of the film prepared at 600 {\deg}C affirmed paramagnetic behavior at room temperature and suggested the half-metallic behavior. The observed properties highlight the potential for further investigations of Rh2MnSb's thin films, focusing on compositional and structural control.</description>

      <title>Lattice distortion tuning resistivity invar effect in high entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with an ultra-low temperature coefficient of resistivity are desired for the temperature and flow sensors in high-precision electronic measuring systems. In this work, the Kubo-Greenwood formula, implemented in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is employed to predict the finite-temperature resistivity of multi-component alloys with severe lattice distortion. We observe a tiny change in resistivity over a wide temperature range in high-entropy alloys. The electronic resistivity invar effect in B2 Ni$_{25}$Co$_{25}$(HfTiZr)$_{50}$ Elinvar alloys results from a balance between intrinsic and residual resistivity. This effect is associated with atomic displacements from ideal lattice sites, which are caused by lattice thermal vibrations and chemical disorder-induced lattice distortions. It is further evidenced by a decrease in lattice distortion with temperature and changes in the electronic density of states.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Lead-Free Chalcogenide Perovskites for High-Efficiency Photovoltaics via Alloying Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free chalcogenide perovskites are emerging as game-changers in the race for sustainable, high-performance photovoltaics. These materials offer a perfect trifecta: non-toxic elemental composition, exceptional phase stability, and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, unlocking their full potential for solar cell applications requires advanced strategies to fine-tune their electronic and optical behavior. In this study, we take CaHfS$_{3}$-a promising but underexplored candidate-and revolutionize its performance by introducing targeted substitutions: Ti at the cation site and Se at the anion site. Using cutting-edge computational techniques, including density functional theory, GW calculations, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we reveal how these substitutions transform the material's properties. Our findings highlight that alloyed compounds such as CaHfS$_{3-x}$Se$_{x}$ and CaHf$_{1-y}$Ti$_{y}$X$_{3}$ (X = S, Se) are not only phase-stable but also feature adjustable direct G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE bandgaps (1.29-2.67 eV), reduced exciton binding energies, and significantly improved polaron mobility. These modifications enable better light absorption, reduced electron-hole recombination, longer exciton lifetimes, and enhanced quantum yield. Impressively, the alloyed perovskites, specifically, for the Ti-rich Se-based perovskites, achieve a spectroscopic-limited maximum efficiency of up to 28.06%, outperforming traditional lead-based halide perovskites. Our results demonstrate that strategic alloying is a powerful tool to supercharge the optoelectronic properties of lead-free chalcogenide perovskites, positioning them as strong contenders for next-generation photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-state quantum geometry is at the root of several static and adiabatic properties, while genuinely dynamic properties are routinely addressed via Kubo formulae, whose essential entries are the excited states. It is shown here that the ground-state metric-curvature tensor evolves in time by means of a causal unitary operator, which by construction elucidates the geometrical effect of the excited states in compact form. In the condensed-matter case the generalized tensor encompasses the whole conductivity tensor at arbitrary frequencies in both insulators and metals, with the exception of the Drude term in the metallic case; the latter is shown to be eminently nongeometrical.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Optoelectronic Potential of AGeX$_{3}$ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se): A Sustainable Alternative in Chalcogenide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for environmentally benign and stable optoelectronic materials has intensified, and chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) have emerged as promising candidates owing to their non-toxic composition, stability, small bandgaps, large absorption coefficients. However, a detailed theoretical study of excitonic and polaronic properties of these materials remains underexplored due to high computational demands. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Germanium-based CPs, AGeX$_{3}$ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se), which adopt distorted perovskite structures (\beta-phase) with an orthorhombic crystal structure (space group : Pnma) by utilizing state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation). Our calculations reveal that these materials are thermodynamically and mechanically stable, with the bandgaps calculated using G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE ranging from 0.646 to 2.001 eV - suitable for optoelectronic devices. We analyze the ionic and electronic contributions to dielectric screening using DFPT and BSE methods, finding that the electronic component dominates. The exciton binding energies range from 0.03 to 73.63 meV, indicating efficient exciton dissociation under ambient conditions. Additionally, these perovskites exhibit low to high polaronic mobilities (1.67-167.65 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$), exceeding many lead-free CPs and halide perovskites due to reduced carrier-phonon interactions. The unique combination of wide tunable bandgaps, low exciton binding energies, and enhanced charge-carrier mobility highlights AGeX$_{3}$ as a potential material for next-generation optoelectronic applications. These compounds are stable, high-performing, and eco-friendly, showing great promise for experimental realization and device integration.</description>

      <title>Discovery of transient topological crystalline order in optically driven SnSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation of quantum materials has opened new frontiers for transiently inducing novel phases of matter, including magnetism, charge density waves, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity beyond the constraints of equilibrium thermodynamics. Triggering a transient topological order in a trivial semiconductor represents a key milestone, as it could provide an on-demand route to topological functionality for device applications. However, achieving a topologically nontrivial phase from a large-gap (~ 1 eV) semiconductor remains a major challenge, as substantial energy modification is required to invert the band gap. Here, we report the discovery of a thermally inaccessible, transient topological crystalline order in a sizable-gap (~ 0.8 eV) layered semiconductor, SnSe, through femtosecond above-gap excitation. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals a Dirac-like linear dispersion forming within the band gap on a subpicosecond timescale. This transient state shows hallmark features of a reflection-invariant topological crystalline insulator, including a high Fermi velocity (2.5x10^5 m/s), multiple Dirac points located away from high-symmetry momenta, and independence from probe photon energy, persisting for several picoseconds even at room temperature. Our findings establish a nonequilibrium pathway to ultrafast topological order in a semiconductor, opening new avenues for optically driven spintronic and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Stacking-dependent topological electronic structures in honeycomb-kagome heterolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures of stacked two-dimensional lattices have shown great promise for engineering novel material properties. As an archetypal example of such a system, the hexagon-shared honeycomb-kagome lattice has been experimentally synthesized in various material platforms. In this work, we explore three rotationally symmetric variants of the honeycomb-kagome lattice: the hexagonal, triagonal, and biaxial phases. While the triagonal and biaxial phases exhibit trivial insulating and Dirac semimetal band structures, respectively, the hexagonal phase hosts a higher-order topological phase driven by band inversion near the $\Gamma$-point. This highlights a key distinction from the conventional band inversions at the $K$-point observed in hexagonal homobilayer systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the distinct topological properties of these phases result in network band structures within moir\'e heterostructures formed by twisted or lattice-mismatched HK systems. These network band structures can be experimentally observed through extrinsic twisting or intrinsic lattice mismatching between the honeycomb and kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Purely Electronic Chirality without Structural Chirality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of purely electronic chirality, which arises in the absence of structural chirality. In condensed matter physics and chemistry, chirality has conventionally been understood as a mirror-image asymmetry in crystal or molecular structures. We demonstrate that certain electronic orders exhibit chirality-related properties without atomic displacement. Specifically, we investigate quadrupole orders to realize such purely electronic chirality with handedness that can be tuned by magnetic fields. As a representative example, we analyze a model featuring $120^\circ$ antiferro quadrupole orders on a distorted kagom\'e lattice, predicting various chirality-related responses in the nonmagnetic ordered phase of URhSn. Furthermore, as a phonon analog, chiral phonons can emerge in achiral crystals through coupling with the pEC order. Our results provide a distinct origin of chirality and a fundamental basis for exploring the interplay between electronic and structural chirality.</description>

      <title>Orbital Wigner functions and quantum transport in multiband systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional theories of electron transport in crystals are based on the Boltzmann equation and do not capture physics arising from quantum coherence. We introduce a transport formalism based on ''orbital Wigner functions'', which accurately captures quantum coherent physics in multiband fermionic systems. We illustrate the power of this approach compared to traditional semiclassical transport theory by testing it numerically against microscopic simulations of one-dimensional, non-interacting, two-band systems -- the simplest systems capable of exhibiting inter-orbital coherence. We show that orbital Wigner functions accurately capture strongly non-equilibrium features of electron dynamics that lie beyond conventional Boltzmann theory, such as the ballistic transport of a relative phase between microscopic orbitals and topological Thouless pumping of charge both at non-zero temperature and away from the adiabatic limit. Our approach is motivated in part by modern ultracold atom experiments that can prepare and measure far-from-equilibrium charge transport and phase coherence in multiband fermionic systems, calling for correspondingly precise theories of transport. The quantitative accuracy exhibited by our approach, together with its capacity to capture nontrivial physics even at the ballistic scale, establishes orbital Wigner functions as an ideal starting point for developing a fully systematic theory of transport in crystals.</description>

      <title>Characterization of ion track etched conical nanopores in thermal and PECVD SiO$_{2}$ using small angle X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conical nanopores in amorphous SiO$_{2}$ thin films fabricated using the ion track etching technique show promising potential for filtration, sensing and nanofluidic applications. The characterization of the pore morphology and size distribution, along with its dependence on the material properties and fabrication parameters, is crucial to designing nanopore systems for specific applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of track-etched nanopores in thermal and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) SiO$_{2}$ using synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We present a new approach for analyzing the complex highly anisotropic 2-dimensional SAXS patterns of the pores by reducing the analysis to two orthogonal 1-dimensional slices of the data. The simultaneous fit of the data enables an accurate determination of the pore geometry and size distribution. The analysis reveals substantial differences between the nanopores in thermal and PECVD SiO$_{2}$. The track-to-bulk etching rate ratio is significantly different for the two materials, producing nanopores with cone angles that differ by almost a factor of 2. Furthermore, thermal SiO$_2$ exhibits an exceptionally narrow size distribution of only ~2-4%, while PECVD SiO$_2$ shows a higher variation ranging from ~8-18%. The impact of ion energy between 89 MeV and 1.6 GeV on the size of the nanopores was also investigated for pores in PECVD SiO$_{2}$ and shows only negligible influence. These findings provide crucial insights for the controlled fabrication of conical nanopores in different materials, which is essential for optimizing membrane performance in applications that require precise pore geometry.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin Ga$_2$O$_3$ Tunneling Contact for 2D Transition-metal Dichalcogenides Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based transistors has been constrained by high contact resistance and inadequate current delivery, primarily stemming from metal-induced gap states and Fermi level pinning. Research into addressing these challenges is essential for the advancing 2D transistors from laboratory experiments to industrial-grade production. In this work, we present amorphous Ga$_2$O$_3$ as a novel tunneling contact layer for multilayer WS2-based field-effect transistors (FETs) to enhance electrical performance. The addition of this innovative tunneling layer avoid Schottky barrier forming while finally change into a tunneling barrier with the barrier height to just 3.7 meV, near-ideal ohmic contacts. This approach effectively reduces contact resistance to only 2.38 k$\Omega\,\mu$m and specific contact resistivity as low as $3 \times 10^{-5}$ $\Omega$cm$^2$. A record-high electron mobility of 296 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ and ON-OFF ratio over 106 are realized for WS$_2$ transistor at room temperature. Compared to other tunneling materials, ultrathin Ga$_2$O$_3$ layer offers scalability, cost-efficient production and broad substrate compatibility, making it well-suited for seamless integration with industrial wafer-scale electronics. A robust device performance remains highly consistent in a large-scale transistor array fabricated on $1.5\times 1.5$ cm$^2$ chips, with the average mobility closing to 200 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$. These findings establish a new benchmark for contact performance in 2D transistors and prove the potential of tunneling contact engineering in advancing high-performance, scalable 29 pelectronics with promising applications in quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Orbital Magnetism in Honeycomb Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital magnetic susceptibility of the tight-binding model for the honeycomb ladder with the additional vertical hopping. Despite being one-dimensional, the magnetic flux penetrating the hexagonal rings affects the energetics of electrons, resulting in the finite orbital magnetic response. We find that the orbital magnetic susceptibility is sensitive to the parameters as well as the chemical potential. At half-filling, the response is diamagnetic when the system is close to the pure honeycomb ladder, whereas it turns to paramagnetic when it is close to the two-leg ladder. We also find several characteristic properties away from half-filling, such as the diamagnetic response at the band top and bottom, and the large paramagnetic response at the band gap sandwiched by the divergent density of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo-lattice model describes a typical spin-charge coupled system in which localized spins and itinerant electrons are strongly coupled via exchange interactions and exhibits a variety of long-wavelength magnetic orders originating from the nesting of Fermi surfaces. Recently, several magnetic materials that realize this model have been discovered experimentally, and they have turned out to exhibit rich topological magnetic phases including skyrmion crystals and hedgehog lattices. Our recent theoretical studies based on the large-scale spin-dynamics simulations have revealed several interesting nonequilibrium phenomena and excitation dynamics in the Kondo-lattice model, e.g., dynamical magnetic topology switching and peculiar spin-wave modes of the skyrmion crystals and the hedgehog lattices under irradiation with electromagnetic waves such as microwaves and light. These achievements are expected to open a new research field to explore novel nonequilibrium topological phenomena and related material functions of the spin-charge coupled magnets.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Intermediate Nematic State in a Bilayer Kagome Metal ScV6Sn6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nematicity, where rotational symmetry of the crystal lattice is spontaneously broken, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in correlated quantum matter, often intertwining with other orders to produce a richer spectrum of phases. Here we report a new phase transition in high-quality ScV6Sn6 bilayer kagome metal at a temperature T^*, occurring seven Kelvins below the charge density wave (CDW) transition at T_CDW, as indicated by thermodynamic, transport, and optical measurements. This emerging intermediate phase does not exhibit spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking, as evidenced by zero-field Sagnac interferometer experiments. However, it displays a strong, spontaneous (strain- and field-free) anisotropy in the kagome plane between T^* and T_CDW, as revealed by transport and optical polarization rotation measurements. Additionally, a pronounced depolarization effect detected by the Sagnac interferometer further confirms its nematic nature. This intermediate nematic phase, alongside the recently discovered intra-unit cell nematic order at much lower temperatures, presents a diverse landscape of nematicities at multiple length and temperature scales, distinguishing it from those observed in kagome metals AV3Sb5. Our findings highlight ScV6Sn6 and the broader RM6X6 intermetallic family as fertile platforms for realizing symmetry-breaking phases driven by a unique interplay of competing CDW instabilities, kagome physics, and Van Hove singularities.</description>

      <title>Superlative spin transport of holes in ultra-thin black phosphorus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of energy-efficient spin-based hybrid devices that can perform functions such as logic, communication, and storage requires the ability to control and transport highly polarized spin currents over long distances in semiconductors. While traditional semiconductors such as silicon support spin transport, the effects of carrier type and concentration on important spin parameters are not well understood due to the need for extrinsic doping, which can cause additional momentum and hence spin scattering. Two-dimensional semiconductors, on the other hand, offer the ability to tune carrier type and concentration through field effect gating and inherently have long intrinsic spin lifetimes, making them a desirable platform for spin transport. Here, we study gate-tunable spin transport across narrow band-gap black phosphorus-based spin valves which enable us to systematically investigate spin transport with varying hole and electron concentrations under non-local geometry. Our findings demonstrate exceptional pure spin transport that approaches intrinsic limit, particularly in the low hole doping range. We achieved record non-local signals reaching 350 {\Omega} and spin lifetimes exceeding 16 ns. Contrary to the behaviour seen in typical semiconductors, we find that the spin transport performance of holes in black phosphorus is significantly better than that of electrons, with the Elliott-Yafet process being the primary spin scattering mechanism. The observation of gate-tunable nanosecond spin lifetimes and colossal pure spin signals in both p- and n-type black phosphorus offers promising prospects for the development of novel semiconducting spintronics devices requiring sharp p-n interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amphorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, we perform a first-principles study of amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and identify low-energy modes in the electronic and phonon spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.</description>

      <title>tda-segmentor: A tool to extract and analyze local structure and porosity features in porous materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local geometrical features of a porous material such as the shape and size of a pore or the curvature of a solid ligament often affect the macroscopic properties of the material, and their characterization is necessary to fully understand the structure-property relationships.In this contribution, we present an approach to automatically segment large porous structures into such local features. Our work takes inspiration from techniques available in Topological Data Analysis(TDA).In particular, using Morse theory, we generate Morse-Smale Complexes(MSC) of our structures that segment the structure, and/or its porosity into individual features that can then be compared. We develop a tool that is built on the topology toolkit (TTK) library, an open source platform for the topological analysis of scalar data, with which we can perform segmentation of these structures. Our tool takes a volumetric grid representation as an input, which can be generated from atomistic or mesh structure models and any function defined on such grid, e.g. the distance to the surface or the interaction energy with a probe. We demonstrate the applicability of the tool by two examples related with analysis of porosity in zeolite materials as well as analysis of ligaments in a porous metal structure. Specifically, by segmenting the pores in the structure we demonstrate some applications to zeolites such as assessing pore-similarity between structures or evaluating the accessible volume to a target molecule such as methane that can be adsorbed to its surface. Moreover, once the MSC's are generated, we can construct graph representations of the void space, replacing the entire pore structure by a simply connected graph. Similarly, the same tool is used to segment and generate graphs representing the solid structure and we show how they can be used to correlate structure and mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Hot Carrier Organic Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot-carrier solar cells use the photon excess energy, that is, the energy exceeding the absorber bandgap, to do additional work. These devices have the potential to beat the upper limit for the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency set by near-equilibrium thermodynamics. However, since their conceptual inception in 1982, no experimental realization that works under normal operational conditions has been demonstrated, mostly due to the fast thermalization of photo-generated charges in typical semiconductor materials. Here, we use noise spectroscopy in combination with numerical modelling to show that common bulk heterojunction organic solar cells actually work as hot-carrier devices. Due to static energetic disorder, thermalization of photo-generated electrons and holes in the global density of states is slow compared to the charge carrier lifetime, leading to thermal populations of localized charge carriers that have an electronic temperature exceeding the lattice temperature. Since charge extraction takes place in a high-lying, narrow energy window around the transport energy, the latter takes the role of an energy filter. For common disorder values, this leads to enhancements in open circuit voltage of up to ~0.2 V. We show that this enhancement can be understood as a thermovoltage that is proportional to the temperature difference between the lattice and the charge populations and that comes on top of the near-equilibrium quasi-Fermi level splitting.</description>

      <title>Embracing Nonlinearity and Geometry: A dimensional analysis guided design of shock absorbing materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protective applications require energy-absorbing materials that are soft and compressible enough to absorb kinetic energy from impacts, yet stiff enough to bear crushing loads. Achieving this balance requires careful consideration of both mechanical properties of the material and geometry of the shock-absorbing pads. Conventional shock-absorbing pads are typically made from very thick foams that exhibit a plateau of constant stress in their stress-strain response, while foams with a non-linearly stiffening stress-strain response are often considered ineffective. Contrary to this belief, we demonstrate that foams with a nonlinear stress-strain response can be effective for achieving protective pads that are both thin and lightweight, particularly for pad geometries requiring a large cross-sectional area. We introduce a new framework for the thickness or volume-constrained design of compact and lightweight protective foams while ensuring the desired structural integrity and mechanical performance. Our streamlined dimensional analysis provides geometric constraints on the dimensionless thickness and cross-sectional area of a protective foam with a given stress-strain response to limit the acceleration and compressive strain within desired critical limits. We also identify optimal mechanical properties that will result in the most compact and lightest protective foam pad for absorbing the given kinetic energy of impact. Guided by this design framework, we achieve optimal protective properties in hierarchically architected vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, enabling next generation protective applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Design and Predict Tetragonal van der Waals Layered Quantum Materials of MPd$_5$I$_2$ (M=Ga, In and 3$d$ Transition Metals)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum materials with stacked van der Waals (vdW) layers hosting non-trivial band structure topology and magnetism have shown many interesting properties. Using high throughput density functional theory calculations, we design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the MPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals). We show that besides the known AlPd$_5$I$_2$, the -MPd$_5$- structural motif of three-atomic-layer slabs separated by two I layers can accommodate a variety of metal atoms giving arise to topologically non-trivial features and highly tunable magnetic properties in both bulk and single layer 2D structures. Among them, TiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and likely an additional strong topological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top valence band, respectively, with their single layers hosting or near quantum spin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane magneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09429v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>

      <title>Barkhausen noise in the columnar hexagonal organic ferroelectric BTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upon a polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material, one stable state changes into another which is typically described by a progression of switching events of smaller fractions of the material. These events give rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise and follow a characteristic distribution in their sizes. Barkhausen noise has been studied to better understand the switching processes of ferroelectrics and has been applied for inorganic ferroelectric materials and perovskites. In this work, we present results from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations investigating the switching process of the small organic molecular ferroelectric benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs). For temperatures below 175 K and sufficiently strong structural disorder, the system exhibits self-organized critical behavior; for higher temperatures, a creep regime is entered. Our extracted power-law exponents are smaller than those typically measured in inorganic crystals and ceramics which indicates that in the more disordered material BTA larger spanning avalanches are possible. The system was experimentally investigated with a high-sensitivity setup. No Barkhausen noise was observed which is consistent with the simulated event sizes, lying several orders beneath the noise threshold of the experimental setup. This finding corroborates the notion that switching in BTA progresses along the 1D columns in the hexagonal liquid crystal lattice, with little coupling between the columns that could give rise to larger lateral avalanches.</description>

Abstract: Spin dynamics in Al-substituted yttrium iron garnets is investigated using broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements in the temperature range T=200-360 K. Using the measured data, the resonance field and linewidth as well as their temperature dependence are determined, with implications for the uniformity and overall quality of the samples prepared via different chemical fabrication routes. These key parameters governing the spin dynamics in the material are important for its applications in high-speed spintronic and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Undamped Soliton-like Domain Wall Motion in Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer van der Waals materials exhibits ultrafast switching speed and fatigue resistance during the polarization switching, offering an avenue for the design of memories and neuromorphic devices. The unique polarization switching behavior originates from the distinct characteristics of domain wall (DW), which possesses broader width and faster motion compared to conventional ferroelectrics. Herein, using machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations and field theory analysis, we predict an undamped soliton-like DW motion in sliding ferroelectrics. It is found that the DW in sliding ferroelectric bilayer 3R-MoS2 exhibits uniformly accelerated motion under an external field, with its velocity ultimately reaches the relativistic-like limit due to continuous acceleration. Remarkably, the DW velocity remains constant even after the external field removal, completely deviating from the velocity breakdown observed in conventional ferroelectrics. This work provides opportunities for applications of sliding ferroelectrics in memory devices based on DW engineering.</description>

      <title>Allegro-FM: Towards Equivariant Foundation Model for Exascale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a foundation model for exascale molecular dynamics simulations by leveraging an E(3) equivariant network architecture (Allegro) and a set of large-scale organic and inorganic materials datasets merged by Total Energy Alignment (TEA) framework. Thanks to the large-scale training sets, the obtained model (Allegro-FM) is versatile for various materials simulations for diverse downstream tasks covering 89 elements in the periodic table. Allegro-FM exhibits excellent agreements with high-level quantum chemistry theories in describing structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties, while exhibiting emergent capabilities for structural correlations, reaction kinetics, mechanical strengths, fracture, and solid/liquid dissolution, for which the model has not been trained. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust predictability and generalizability of Allegro-FM for chemical reactions using the Transition1x that consists of 10k organic reactions and 9.6 million configurations including transition state data, as well as calcium silicate hydrates as a testbed. With its computationally efficient, strictly-local network architecture, Allegro-FM scales up to multi-billion-atom systems with a parallel efficiency of 0.964 on the exaflop/s Aurora supercomputer at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. The approach presented in this work demonstrates the potential of the foundation model for a novel materials design and discovery based on large-scale atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic BN-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. Response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.</description>

      <title>Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

Abstract: We employ a systematic approach to construct superconducting order parameters based on the spin space group. Compared to magnetic space groups where spatial and spin rotation of elements are completely locked, the superconducting channels and the forms of basis functions in spin space groups can be different. Furthermore, we utilize the obtained basis functions to construct the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and discuss the possible superconducting ground states as well as the interplay between superconducting states and magnetic orders. By virtue of those results, we discuss the application of our theory to realistic systems. Our work provides a rigorous description of superconducting gap functions in the case of spin space group, and enables further study of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</description>

Abstract: Kagome systems have garnered considerable attention due to the unique features of the sublattice structure and band topology. The recently discovered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A = K, Rb, Cs) host a rich array of symmetry-breaking phases, including exotic charge density waves (CDW), electronic nematicity, pair density waves (PDW) and superconductivity. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations into the diverse phases, several key issues remain contentious, such as a solid clarification of the time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRS-breaking) in the CDW order and its implications for the nature of superconducting (SC) pairing symmetry. This review aims to shed light on the transport properties of these intertwined phases, emphasizing the pivotal role that transport measurements play in uncovering the non-trivial quantum states of matter.</description>
