      <title>Two-dimensional Carreau law for a quasi-newtonian fluid flow through a thin domain with a slightly rough boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic behavior of the steady-state quasi-Newtonian Stokesflow with viscosity given by the Carreau law within a thin domain, focusing on the effects of a slightly rough boundary of the domain. Employing asymptotic techniques with respect to the domain's thickness, we rigorously derive the effective nonlinear two-dimensional Reynolds model describing the fluid flow. The mathematical analysis is based on deriving the sharp a priori estimates and proving the compactness results of the rescaled functions together with monotonicity arguments. The resulting limit model incorporates contributions of the oscillating boundary and thus, it could prove useful in the applications involving this lubrication regime.</description>

      <title>Transition from Continuous to Jumping Solutions in 2D Quasi-static Elastic Contact Problems with Coulomb Friction: the Mathematics Underlying the Onset of Brake Squeal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the quasi-static elastic contact problem with Coulomb friction in a very general setting, with possible jumps in time for both the load and the solution. Exploiting ideas originating in our recent paper [4], we exhibit an optimal condition on the magnitude of the friction coefficient under which we prove the existence of an absolutely continuous solution for arbitrary absolutely continuous loads in the case of the most general 2D problem. We provide examples showing that, when the condition is violated, spontaneous jumps in time of the solution may occur, even when the load varies absolutely continuously in time. We argue that these spontaneous jumps in time of the solution in the quasi-static problem reveal a transition of the process from a quasi-static nature to a dynamic nature, interpreted as the mathematical signature of the onset of friction-induced vibrations in the elastodynamic contact problem with dry friction.</description>

      <title>Parabolic abstract evolution equations in cylindrical domains and uniformly local Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider parabolic equations of the type $$\partial_t u(x,t)=\Delta u(x,t) - Bu(x,t) + F(u(x,t))$$ where $u$ is valued in a transverse Hilbert space $Y$ and $B$ is a positive self-adjoint operator on $Y$, allowing a different diffusion mechanism in the transverse direction. We aim at considering solutions with infinite energy and we study the Cauchy problem in the uniformly local spaces associated with the norm $$\|u\|_{L^2_{\text{ul}}(\mathbb{R},Y)}= \sup_{a\in\mathbb{R}^d} \|u(x)\|_{L^2(B(a,1),Y)}.$$ For the classical parabolic equation, i.e. if $Y=\mathbb{R}$, it is known that the Cauchy problem is ill-posed in the weak version of the uniformly local spaces but well-posed in a stronger version, where additional uniform continuity is required. In this paper, we show that the linear operator $\partial^2_{xx} - B$ is not necessarily a sectorial operator in any version of the uniformly local Lebesgue space, due to the possible non-density of its domain. Then, we use the theory of parabolic abstract evolution equations to set a well-posed Cauchy problem, even in the weak version of the uniformly local space. In particular, we believe that this paper offers a new perspective on the comparison between both versions of the uniformly local spaces and also provides a new natural example of differential operators with non-dense domain.</description>

      <title>Isometric Immersions and Weak Solutions to the Darboux Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Darboux equation, a fundamental PDE arising in the theory of isometric immersions of two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds into $\mathbb{R}^3$, in the low-regularity regime. We introduce a notion of weak solution for $u\in C^{1,\theta}$ with $\theta&gt;1/2$, and show that the classical correspondence between solutions of the Darboux equation and isometric immersions remains valid in this regime. The key ingredient is an extension of the classical flatness criterion to H\"older continuous metrics, achieved via an analysis of a weak notion of Gaussian curvature.</description>

      <title>A viscosity solution as a piecewise classical solution to a free boundary problem for the optimal switching problem with simultaneous multiple switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \citeN{suzuki2020optimal} proves the uniqueness of the viscosity solution to a variational inequality which is solved by the value function of the infinite horizon optimal switching problem with simultaneous multiple switchings. Although it also identifies each connected region possibly including at most one connected switching region, the exact switching regions of the solution are not identified. The problem is finally converted into a system of free boundary problems and generally solved by the numerical calculation. However, if the PDE part of the variational inequality has a classical solution, the viscosity solution may be constructed as a series of piecewise classical solutions, possibly analytical.
  Under a certain assumption we prove that the series of piecewise classical solutions is indeed the viscosity solution on $\real{}$, after we prove the smooth pasting condition is its necessary condition, and establish the algorithm to compute all the free boundaries. Applying the results to the concrete problem studied in \citeN{suzuki2020optimal} we find the explicit solution and identify the continuation and switching regions in a computer with Python programs.</description>

      <title>Existence of spiral strategies for blocking fire spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem for blocking fire by constructing a wall $\zeta$ whose shape is spiral-like. This is supposed to be the best strategy when a single firefighter is constructing the wall with a finite construction speed $\sigma$: the barriers which satisfy this bound on the construction speed are called admissible.
  We prove a sharp version of Bressan's Fire Conjecture in this case, i.e. when admissible barriers are spiral-like curves: namely, there exists a spiral-like barrier confining the fire in a bounded region of $\mathbb R^2$ if and only if the speed of construction of the barrier $\sigma$ is strictly larger than a critical speed $\bar \sigma = 2.614...$.
  The existence of confining spiral barriers for $\sigma &gt; \bar \sigma$ is already known [Bressan A. et al., 2008, Klein R. et al., 2019], while we concentrate on the negative side, i.e. if $\sigma \leq \bar \sigma$ no admissible spiral blocks the fire.
  The proof of these results relies on: 1) the precise definition of spiral barrier and its representation; 2) the analysis of saturated spiral barriers as a Retarded Differential Equation (RDE) in the spirit of [Klein R. et al., 2019]; 3) the equivalent reformulation of the conjecture as a minimum problem for a prescribed functional; 4) the construction of the optimal closing spiral; 5) the analysis of a differentiable path of admissible spirals along which the functional is differentiable, and in particular increasing when moving from the optimal spiral to any other one (homotopy argument).
  Due to the complexity of the solution, the evaluation of the quantities needed to prove that the functional is increasing is performed numerically.</description>

      <title>Geometrical characterizations of radiating and non-radiating elastic sources and mediums with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate two types of time-harmonic elastic wave scattering problems. The first one involves the scattered wave generated by an active elastic source with compact support. The second one concerns elastic wave scattering caused by an inhomogeneous medium, also with compact support. We derive several novel quantitative results concerning the geometrical properties of the underlying scatterer, the associated source or incident wave field, and the physical parameters. In particular, we show that a scatterer with either a small support or high-curvature boundary points must radiate at any frequency. These qualitative characterizations allow us to establish several local and global uniqueness results for determining the support of the source or medium scatterer from a single far-field measurement. Furthermore, we reveal new geometric properties of elastic transmission eigenfunctions. To derive a quantitative relationship between the intensity of a radiating or non-radiating source and the diameter of its support, we utilize the Helmholtz decomposition, the translation-invariant $L^2$-norm estimate for the Lam\'e operator, and global energy estimates. Another pivotal technical approach combines complex geometric optics (CGO) solutions with local regularity estimates, facilitating microlocal analysis near admissible $K$-curvature boundary points.</description>

      <title>Modulation of the Monokinetic Limit for Models of Collective Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform modulation analysis of monokinetic limits from the kinetic Cucker- Smale model to the pressureless Euler alignment system. Two regimes are considered -- a strong Fokker- Planck force with vanishing noise and Knudsen number, and a pure noiseless Vlasov scheme. In the former case, we demonstrate convergence of the modulated profile to the standard Gaussian distribution, while in the latter case, the distribution converges to a profile satisfying an explicit transport equation along limiting characteristics.</description>

      <title>Velocity optimization of self-equilibrated obstacles in a two-dimensional viscous flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An obstacle is immersed in an externally driven 2D Stokes or Navier-Stokes fluid. We study the self-equilibration conditions for that obstacle under steady state assumptions on the flow. We then seek to optimize the translational and/or angular velocity of the obstacle by varying its shape. To allow general variations, we must consider a very large class of obstacles for which the notion of trace is meaningless. This forces us to revisit the notion of self-equilibration for both Stokes and Navier-Stokes in a measure theoretic environment.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ boundedness of wave operators for the Laplace operator with finite rank perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $L^p$ boundedness of wave operators for the Laplace operator with finite rank perturbations \begin{equation*}
  H=-\Delta+\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\langle\cdot\,, \varphi_i\rangle \varphi_i \qquad \mbox{on}\,\,\, \R^d. \end{equation*} For dimensions $d\ge 3$, we prove that the wave operators $W_\pm(H,H_0)$ are bounded on $L^p$ for the full range $1\le p\le \infty$. This extends the work of Nier and the third author \cite{NS} by resolving the previously unexplored question of boundedness at the endpoint cases $p=1$ and $p=\infty$. In lower dimensions $d = 1, 2$, we establish the $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators for the first time. Furthermore, we reveal an intriguing dichotomy in the endpoint case $p = 1$: \begin{itemize}
  \item If $\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \varphi_i(x) \, \d x = 0$ holds for every $1\le i\le N$, then the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for all $1 \leq p \leq \infty$.
  \item If there exists at least one $i$ ($1\le i\le N$) such that $\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\varphi_i(x)\d x\ne0$, then the wave operators remain bounded for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and satisfy weak type $(1,1)$ estimates, but fail to be bounded on $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$. \end{itemize}</description>

      <title>Bounds for spectral projectors on the three-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $L^2$ to $L^p$ operator norms of spectral projectors for the Euclidean Laplacian on the torus in the case where the spectral window is narrow. With a window of constant size this is a classical result of Sogge; in the small-window limit we are left with $L^p$ norms of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, as considered for instance by Bourgain. For the three-dimensional torus we prove new cases of a previous conjecture of the first two authors concerning the size of these norms; we also refine certain prior results to remove $\epsilon$-losses in all dimensions. We use methods from number theory: the geometry of numbers, the circle method and exponential sum bounds due to Guo. We complement these techniques with height splitting and a bilinear argument to prove sharp results.
  We exposit on the various techniques used and their limitations.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The developments over the last five decades concerning numerical discretisations of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations have lead to reliable tools for their approximation: those include stable methods to properly address the incompressibility constraint, stable discretisations to account for convection dominated problems, efficient time (splitting) methods, and methods to tackle their nonlinear character. While these tools may successfully be applied to reliably simulate even more complex fluid flow PDE models, their understanding requires a fundamental revision in the case of stochastic fluid models, which are gaining increased importance nowadays.
  This work motivates and surveys optimally convergent numerical methods for the stochastic Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations that were obtained in the last decades. Furtheremore, we computationally illustrate the failure of some of those methods from the deterministic setting, if they are straight-forwardly applied to the stochastic case. In fact, we explain why some of these deterministic methods perform sub-optimally by highlighting crucial analytical differences between the deterministic and stochastic equations -- and how modifications of the deterministic methods restore their optimal performance if they properly address the probabilistic nature of the stochastic problem.
  Next to the numerical analysis of schemes, we propose a general benchmark of prototypic fluid flow problems driven by different types of noise to also compare new algorithms by simulations in terms of complexities, efficiencies, and possible limitations. The driving motivation is to reach a better comparison of simulations for new schemes in terms of accuracy and complexities, and to also complement theoretical performance studies for restricted settings of data by more realistic ones.</description>

      <title>Interaction energies in paranematic colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of colloidal particles embedded in a paranematic -- an isotropic phase of a nematogenic medium above the temperature of the nematic-to-isotropic transition. In this state, the nematic order is induced by the boundary conditions in a narrow band around each particle and it decays exponentially in the bulk.
  We develop rigorous asymptotics of the linearization of the appropriate variational model that allow us to describe weak far-field interactions between the colloidal particles in two dimensional paranematic suspensions. We demonstrate analytically that decay rates of solutions to the full nonlinear and linear problems are similar and verify numerically that the interactions between the particles in these problems have similar dependence on the distance between the particles. Finally, we perform Monte-Carlo simulations for a system of colloidal particles in a paranematic and describe the statistical properties of this system.</description>

The model can be viewed as a regularized version of the Kimura equation and admits a continuous solution. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution to the regularized system. Numerical experiments illustrate that, for sufficiently small regularization parameters, the model can capture key phenomena of the original Kimura equation, such as gene fixation and conservation of the first moment.</description>

      <title>Operator dependent para-controlled calculus, periodic homogenisation and singular PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a variant of the para-controlled distributions framework based on operator dependent (generalised) Besov spaces. These spaces were introduced by Kerkyacharian-Petrushev ([KP15]). In contrast to the Fourier decomposition in the classical setting, they are built from spectral decomposition of general self-adjoint elliptic operators. A major difference is that products of two spectrally localised functions in general have ``frequencies" spread over the whole spectrum. We obtain a decay estimate on ``high frequency" component of the product of two spectrally-localised functions. This enables us to obtain uniform bounds for the naturally associated para-product and commutator operations over a class of operators. This in particular includes the family of periodic homogenisation operators uniform in the oscillation parameter.
  Next, we show convergence properties of these operations in the periodic homogenisation setting. A key ingredient is the convergence of the generalised Littlewood-Paley block operators with quantitative dependence on the spectrum level. The proof combines a novel clustering argument to group nearby eigenvalues, Weyl's asymptotic formula that implies quantitative bounds on the sizes and locations of the eigenvalue clusters, together with a result by Kenig-Lin-Shen ([KLS13]) on convergence of individual eigenvalues.
  Finally, we apply this framework to periodic homogenisation problems for dynamical $\Phi^4_3$ and KPZ equations. Assuming the convergence of stochastic objects to their homogenised limit, we show that the solutions and fluxes also converge to the corresponding limits. The convergence of the explicit stochastic terms with suitable renormalisations will be treated in a separate note.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining local bifurcation analysis with numerical continuation and bifurcation methods we study bifurcations from cylindrical vesicles described by the Helfrich equation with volume and area constraints, with a prescribed periodicity along the cylindrical axis. The bifurcating solutions are in two main classes, axisymmetric (pearling), and non-axisymmetric (coiling, buckling, and wrinkling), and depending on the spontaneous curvature and the prescribed periodicity along the cylinder axis we obtain different stabilities of the bifurcating branches, and different secondary bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Exponential equilibration of an electro-energy-reaction-diffusion system arising from a two-level semiconductor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamically correct framework for electro-energy-reaction-diffusion systems, which feature a monotone entropy functional while conserving the total charge and the total energy. For these systems, we construct a relative entropy functional, which acts as a Lyapunov functional, and we also give an expression for the related entropy production functional. The main result of this note is the constructive derivation of an explicit entropy-entropy production inequality in a special situation, namely for a two-level semiconductor model of Shockley-Read-Hall type. Supposing that global bounded solutions exist, we show that the relative entropy decays exponentially along trajectories of the underlying system. As a consequence, these global solutions converge to the equilibrium at an exponential rate.</description>

      <title>Decay of small energy solutions in the ABCD Boussinesq model under the influence of an uneven bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $abcd$ Boussinesq system, introduced by Bona, Chen, and Saut, describes a four-parameter $(a,b,c,d)$ family of models formulated on the time-space domain $\mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}_x$. It serves as a first-order two-wave approximation to the two-dimensional incompressible, irrotational water wave equations in shallow water, inspired by Boussinesq's classical derivation. Within the different parameter regimes, the generic regime is described by $b,d&gt;0$ and $a,c&lt;0$ while the system becomes Hamiltonian when $b=d$. Previously, sharp local in space $H^1\times H^1$ decay properties were proved in the case of a large class of $abcd$ model under the small data assumption. In this paper, we generalize [C. Kwak, \emph{et. al.}, \emph{The scattering problem for Hamiltonian ABCD Boussinesq systems in the energy space}. J. Math. Pures Appl. (9) 127 (2019), 121--159] by considering the small data $abcd$ decay problem in the physically relevant \emph{variable bottom regime} described by M. Chen. The nontrivial bathymetry is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function $h=h(t,x)$, which obeys integrability in time and smallness in space. We prove first the existence of small global solutions in $H^1\times H^1$. Then, for a sharp set of dispersive $abcd$ systems (characterized only in terms of parameters $a, b$ and $c$), every $H^1\times H^1$ small solution must converges to zero inside of the light cone $|x|\leq |t|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local properties of positive solutions of the equation -Delta u= exp(u) in a punctured domain Omega of RN in the range of parameters q &gt; 1 and M &gt; 0. We prove a series of a priori estimates near a singular point. In the case of radial solutions we use various techniques inherited from the dynamical systems theory to obtain the precise behaviour of singular solutions. We prove also the existence of singular solutions with these precise behaviours.</description>

      <title>Global solvability for doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system with a wide range of bacterial responses in physical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of bacteria's response to environmental conditions, we consider the doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system \begin{align*} \begin{cases} u_t=\nabla\cdot(uv\nabla u)-\chi\nabla\cdot(u^{\alpha}v\nabla v)+\ell uv,\\ v_t=\Delta v-uv, \end{cases} \end{align*} subjected to no-flux boundary conditions and smooth initial data, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ is the bacterial response parameter. Global solvability of weak solutions to this taxis system is highly challenging due to not only the doubly nonlinear diffusion and its degeneracy but also the strong chemotactic effect, where the latter is strong at the large species density if $\alpha$ is close to $2$. Recent findings on the global weak solvability for the considered system are summarised as follows \begin{itemize} \item In [M. Winkler, \textit{Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.}, 2021] for $\alpha=2$, $N=1$; \item In [M. Winkler, \textit{J. Differ. Equ.}, 2024] for $1\le\alpha\le 2$, $N=2$ with initial data of small size if $\alpha=2$; \item In [Z. Zhang and Y. Li, \textit{arXiv:2405.20637}, 2024] for $\alpha=2$, $N=2$; and \item In [G. Li, \textit{J. Differ. Equ.}, 2022] for $\frac{7}{6}&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{13}{9}$, $N=3$. \end{itemize} Our work aims to provide a picture of global weak solvability for $0\le\alpha&lt;2$ in the physically dimensional setting $N=3$. As suggested by the analysis, it is divided into three separable cases, including (i) $0\le\alpha\le 1$: Weak chemotaxis effect; (ii) $1&lt;\alpha\le 3/2$: Moderate chemotaxis effect; and (iii) $3/2&lt;\alpha&lt;2$: Strong chemotaxis effect.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the Cauchy Problem for One-Dimensional Nonlinear Diffusion Equations with Dynamic and Fourth-Type Boundary Conditions in the Lp Lq Maximal Regularity Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for a one-dimensional diffusion equation equipped with a dynamic boundary condition and an additional boundary condition that renders the one-dimensional Laplace operator self-adjoint. The equation serves as a model for describing filtration in aquaria, originally introduced by the author and Kitahata. The boundary condition treated in this work differs from classical types such as Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions; we refer to it as the fourth or FK-type boundary condition. The boundary condition is designed to capture interactions between the two boundaries in the context of filtration. The framework for establishing well-posedness is based on L^p-L^q maximal regularity classes.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper [S. Alinhac, The null condition for quasilinear wave equations in two space dimensions I, Invent. Math. 145 (2001), no. 3, 597-618], S. Alinhac established the global existence of small data smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions. However, for the corresponding 2-D initial boundary value problem in exterior domains, it is still open whether the global solutions exist. When the 2-D quadratic nonlinearity admits a special $Q_0$ type null form, the global small solution is shown in our previous article [Hou Fei, Yin Huicheng, Yuan Meng, Global smooth solutions of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains, arXiv:2411.06984]. In the present paper, we now solve this open problem through proving the global existence of small solutions to 2-D general quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains. Our proof procedure is based on finding appropriate divergence structures of quasilinear wave equations under null conditions, introducing a good unknown to eliminate the resulting $Q_0$ type nonlinearity and deriving some new precise pointwise spacetime decay estimates of solutions and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>Gelation in cluster coagulation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of gelation in the cluster coagulation model introduced by Norris [\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.}, 209(2):407-435 (2000)], where pairs of clusters of types $(x,y)$ taking values in a measure space $E$, merge to form a new particle of type $z\in E$ according to a transition kernel $K(x,y, \mathrm{d} z)$. This model possesses enough generality to accommodate inhomogeneities in the evolution of clusters, including variations in their shape or spatial distribution. We derive general, sufficient criteria for stochastic gelation in this model. As particular cases, we extend results related to the classical Marcus--Lushnikov coagulation process, showing that reasonable `homogenous' coagulation processes with exponent $\gamma&gt;1$ yield gelation; and also, coagulation processes with kernel $\bar{K}(m,n)~\geq~(m \wedge n) \log{(m \wedge n)}^{3 +\epsilon}$ for $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey Bernstein-type theorems for graphical surfaces in the Euclidean space and the Lorentz-Minkowski space. More specifically, we explain several proofs of the Bernstein theorem for minimal graphs in the Euclidean 3-space. Furthermore, we show the Heinz-type mean curvature estimates for graphs in the Euclidean 3-space and space-like graphs in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space. As an application of these estimates, we give Bernstein-type theorems for constant mean curvature graphs in the Euclidean 3-space and constant mean curvature space-like graphs in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space, respectively. We also study Bernstein-type results for minimal graphs in the Euclidean 4-space and the Calabi-Bernstein theorem in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space.</description>

      <title>A notion of partial order in the Choose the Leader model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we continue the study of non-chaotic asymptotic correlations in many element systems and discuss the emergence of a new notion of asymptotic correlation -- partial order -- in the Choose the Leader (CL) system. Similarly to the newly defined notion of order, partial order refers to alignment of the elements in the system -- though it allows for deviation from total adherence. Our presented work revolves around the definition of partial order and shows its emergence in the CL model in its original critical scaling. Furthermore, we discuss the propagation of partial order in the CL model and give a quantitative estimate to the convergence to this state. This new notion (as well as that of order) opens the door to exploring old and new (probabilistic) models of biological and societal nature in a more realistic way.</description>
