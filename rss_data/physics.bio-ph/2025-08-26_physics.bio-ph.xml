      <title>Thermal convection in huddling emperor penguins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emperor penguins are the only penguin species that winter in Antarctica. As is known, during cold weather, birds huddle together to share body heat. We developed a microscopic model in which penguins interact with each other through an effective potential that describes the birds' intention to move along the gradient of the thermal field. The model describes the aggregation of penguins into a motionless huddle, as observed previously. More interestingly, we found that increasing the number of birds leads to a second-order phase transition, characterized by the excitation of a vortex motion in a huddle. The dynamic behavior ensures a more efficient redistribution of heat between penguins and, consequently, the survival of all birds in the flock. To study the instability mechanism, we developed a continuous model and applied both linear and weakly nonlinear analysis. Numerically, we studied the increasing complexity of vortex structures in a fluidized huddle with increasing its power. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of sudden fluidization of a huddle, resulting in the spontaneous motion of penguins from the edge of the crowd to its center and back, is essentially thermal convection. The findings are juxtaposed against observations of emperor penguins.</description>

      <title>One pocket to activate them all: Efforts on understanding the modulator pocket in K2P channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modulator pocket is a cryptic site discovered in the TREK1 K2P channel that accommodates agonists capable of increasing the channel's activity. Since its discovery, equivalent sites in other K2P channels have been shown to bind various ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. In this review, we attempt to elucidate how the modulator pocket contributes to K2P channel activation. To this end, we first describe the gating mechanisms reported in the literature and rationalize their modes of action. We then highlight previous experimental and computational evidence for agonists that bind to the modulator pocket, together with mutations at this site that affect gating. Finally, we elaborate how the activation signal arising from the modulator pocket is transduced to the gates in K2P channels. In doing so, we outline a potential common modulator pocket architecture across K2P channels: a largely amphipathic structure -consistent with the expected properties of a pocket exposed at the interface between a hydrophobic membrane and the aqueous solvent- but still with some important channel-sequence-variations. This architecture and its key differences can be leveraged for the design of new selective and potent modulators.</description>

      <title>Cellular Flow Architecture Exposes the Hidden Mechanics of Biological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biomechanical reorganization governs key biological processes, such as morphogenesis and development, requires predictive insights into stress distributions and cellular behavior. While traditional approaches focused on cell motion as a response to stress, we demonstrate that Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) -- robust attractors and repellers in cellular flows -- precede and drive long-term intercellular stress reorganization, physically governed by the mechanical properties of intercellular junctions. We show that this hidden flow skeleton correlates strongly with biomechanical metrics, bridging microscopic cell motion with mesoscopic biomechanics. Specifically, attractors and repellers mark hotspots of compressive and tensile stress enrichment (exceeding tenfold), alongside heterogeneities in cell packing. Notably, these connections remain robust across varying strengths of cell-cell and cell-substrate force transmission. Finally, by linking the attracting regions in the flow skeleton to future cell extrusion spots, we establish a direct link between cell motion and biologically significant outcomes. Together, these findings establish a framework for using cell motion to independently infer biomechanical metrics and bridge the scale mismatch between cell motion and biomechanics, potentially offering a new route to interpret mechanosensitive biological processes directly from cell trajectories.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid phase separation enables highly selective viral genome packaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many viruses, hundreds of proteins assemble an outer shell (capsid) around the viral nucleic acid to form an infectious virion. How the assembly process selects the viral genome amidst a vast excess of diverse cellular nucleic acids is poorly understood. It has recently been discovered that many viruses perform assembly and genome packaging within liquid-liquid phase separated biomolecular condensates inside the host cell. However, the role of condensates in genome packaging is poorly understood. Here, we construct equilibrium and dynamical rate equation models for condensate-coupled assembly and genome packaging. We show that when the viral genome and capsid proteins favorably partition into the condensate, assembly rates, yields, and packaging efficiencies can increase by orders of magnitude. Selectivity is further enhanced by the condensate when capsid proteins are translated during assembly and packaging. Our results suggest that viral condensates provide a mechanism to ensure robust and highly selective assembly of virions around viral genomes. More broadly, our results may apply to other types of selective co-assembly processes that occur within biomolecular condensates, and suggest that liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates could be exploited for selective encapsulation of microscopic cargo in human-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Discovering universal temperature regulation dynamics in animals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hibernation is an adaptation to extreme environmental seasonality that has been studied for almost 200 years, but our understanding of the underlying physiological system remains lacking due to the partially observed nature of the system. During hibernation, small mammals, such as the Arctic ground squirrel, exhibit dramatic oscillations in body temperature, typically one of the only physiological states measured, of up to 40 $^{\circ}$C. These spikes are known as interbout arousals and typically occur 10-20 times throughout hibernation. The physiological process that drives interbout arousals is unknown, but two distinct macro-scale mechanisms have been hypothesized. Using model selection for partially observed systems and classical dynamical systems theory, we are able to differentiate between these two hypotheses using only body temperature data recorded from a free-ranging Arctic ground squirrel, and show that our model can capture the broad features of the observed seasonal physiological transitions. We then modify our discovered physiological model of Arctic ground squirrel to include environmental information and find that we can qualitatively match body temperature data recorded from a wide range of species, including a bird, a shrew, and a bear, which also dynamically modulate body temperature. Our results suggest that a universal, environmentally sensitive core regulator could control body temperature across a diverse range of species -- a restructuring of our current understanding of the physiological organization across species. While the findings presented here are applicable to thermophysiology, the general modeling procedure is applicable to time series data collected from partially observed biological, chemical, physical, mechanical, and cosmic systems for which the goal is to elucidate the underlying mechanism or control structure.</description>

Abstract: There is a global need for BioImage Analysis (BIA) as advances in life sciences increasingly rely on cutting-edge imaging systems that have dramatically expanded the complexity and dimensionality of biological images. Turning these data into scientific discoveries requires people with effective data management skills and knowledge of state-of-the-art image processing and data analysis, in other words, BioImage Analysts. The Global BioImage Analysts' Society (GloBIAS) aims to enhance the profile of BioImage Analysts as a key role in science and research. Its vision encompasses fostering a global network, democratising access to BIA by providing educational resources tailored to various proficiency levels and disciplines, while also establishing guidelines for BIA courses. By collaboratively shaping the education of BioImage Analysts, GloBIAS aims to unlock the full potential of BIA in advancing life science research and to consolidate BIA as a career path. To better understand the needs and geographical representation of the BIA community, a worldwide survey was conducted and 291 responses were collected across people from all career stages and continents. This work discusses how GloBIAS aims to address community-identified shortcomings in work environment, funding, and scientific activities. The survey underscores a strong interest from the BIA community in activities proposed by GloBIAS and their interest to actively contribute. With 72% of respondents willing to pay for membership, the community's enthusiasm for both online and in-person events is set to drive the growth and sustainability of GloBIAS.</description>

      <title>Diffusion MRI invariants: from the group of rotations to a complete neuroimaging fingerprint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micrometer-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMR) to cellular-level tissue structure. The advent of precision medicine and quantitative imaging hinges on revealing the information content of dMR, and providing its parsimonious basis- and hardware-independent ``fingerprint". Here we focus on the geometry of a multi-dimensional dMR signal, derive a complete set of 21 diffusion and covariance tensor invariants in terms of irreducible representations of the group of rotations, and relate them to tissue properties. Conventional dMR metrics are shown to be redundant, while most of the invariants provide novel complementary information. Our complete set of invariants for the kurtosis tensor improves multiple sclerosis classification in a cohort of 1189 subjects. We design acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices guaranteeing minimal number of measurements to determine the most used invariants in only 1--2 minutes for the whole brain. Representing dMR signals via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of brain pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMR into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Imaging of Plant Delayed Luminescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delayed luminescence (DL) is a quantized signal that is characteristic of photoexcited molecules entering a relaxed state. Studying DL provides critical insight into photophysical mechanisms through the analysis of specific spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we developed a high-sensitivity DL imaging system using a quantitative scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (qCMOS) camera and a single-photon counting resolution. By optimizing the optical architecture and signal processing algorithms together, we achieved full-field spatiotemporal DL imaging at megapixel resolution (i.e., $2304 \times 4096$ pixels). Key findings include the following: (1) we observed spatial heterogeneity in DL intensity across the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, with stronger signals detected in veins and at sites of mechanical injury; (2) species-specific DL responses occur in response to oxidative stress, with Hydrocotyle vulgaris and Ginkgo biloba showing enhanced central DL activity; (3) excitation using white light induced maximum DL intensity, while red and blue light differentially modulated decay kinetics. Finally, we develop a two-level quantum model that links DL dynamics to the populations of excited-state electrons, thereby developing a theoretical framework for future photophysical research. Collectively, this work establishes a theoretical and technological framework for advancing plant phenotyping under stress conditions and optimizing light environments.</description>

      <title>Kinetic roughening transition of ice crystals and its implications during recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis Roughening transitions at solid-liquid interfaces govern crystal morphology in diverse systems. In ice crystallization, these transitions control interfacial faceting and surface kinetics. Faceted morphologies are often associated with ice-active molecules, which inhibit recrystallization and are essential for cryopreservation. We hypothesize that kinetic roughening transitions can induce faceting even in the absence of ice-active agents, particularly at high solute concentrations with depressed melting points, potentially complicating the interpretation of crystal morphology as an indicator of ice activity.
  Experiments We investigated the kinetic roughening transition of ice in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proline-water solutions using cryomicroscopy and real-time image analysis. Crystals grew in microdroplets, maintaining near-equilibrium conditions as solute concentration increased during growth due to conversion of liquid water to ice. Antifreeze protein type III (AFPIII) was applied to distinguish intrinsic roughening from adsorption-mediated effects.
  Findings A distinct kinetic roughening transition temperature (TR = -16.0 +/- 0.2 oC) was identified, marking a shift from rounded disks at higher temperatures to faceted hexagonal plates at lower temperatures, independent of solute type. Recrystallization below TR revealed asymmetry between growth and melting interfaces. AFPIII promoted faceting even above TR, consistent with stabilization of step edges and elevation of the roughening transition temperature. These results clarify the interplay between intrinsic interface kinetics and molecular adsorption, with implications for interpreting ice morphology, surface roughening, and cryopreservation design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>

      <title>Intestinal villi and crypts density maximizing nutrient absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The villi and crypts of the gastrointestinal tract increase the effective surface area of the intestinal mucosa, potentially enhancing nutrient absorption. It is commonly assumed that this is their primary function, and that a higher villi density necessarily leads to improved absorption. However, when villi are packed too closely together, diffusion can be hindered, potentially offsetting this benefit. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the density of these structures and the overall efficiency of absorption. In three different simplified geometries, approximating crypts, leaf-like villi, and finger-like villi we calculate analytically the concentration profile and the absorption flux, assuming that there is only diffusion between these structures while the lumen is well mixed. When plotting the absorption flux per unit of gut length as a function of the structures' density, we observe that there is a density maximizing absorption. We study numerically this optimum. It depends weakly on the absorption properties of the given nutrient, so that a geometry optimal for one nutrient is close to optimum for another nutrient. Physiological data from various animal species align with this predicted optimal range and potentially reflect evolutionary selection for efficient nutrient uptake, supporting the model's validity.</description>
