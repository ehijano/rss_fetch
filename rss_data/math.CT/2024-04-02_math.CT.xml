      <title>Functor String Diagrams: A Novel Approach to Flexible Diagrams for Applied Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of abstraction and composition - the focus of category theory - naturally leads to sophisticated diagrams which can encode complex algebraic semantics. Consequently, these diagrams facilitate a clearer visual comprehension of diverse theoretical and applied systems. Complex algebraic structures - otherwise represented by a forest of symbols - can be encoded into diagrams with intuitive graphical rules. The prevailing paradigm for diagrammatic category theory are monoidal string diagrams whose specification reflects the axioms of monoidal categories. However, such diagrams struggle in accurately portraying crucial categorical constructs such as functors or natural transformations, obscuring central concepts such as the Yoneda lemma or the simultaneous consideration of hom-functors and products. In this work, we introduce functor string diagrams, a systematic approach for the development of categorical diagrams which allows functors, natural transformations, and products to be clearly represented. We validate their practicality in multiple dimensions. We show their usefulness for theoretical manipulations by proving the Yoneda lemma, show that they encompass monoidal string diagrams and hence their helpful properties, and end by showing their exceptional applied utility by leveraging them to underpin neural circuit diagrams, a method which, at last, allows deep learning architectures to be comprehensively and rigorously expressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a detailed proof of the B\'enabou-Roubaud theorem. As a byproduct it yields a weakening of its hypotheses: the base category does not need fibre products and the Beck-Chevalley condition, in the form of a natural transformation, can be weakened by only requiring the latter to be epi.</description>

      <title>Abstract Kleisli structures on 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F\"uhrmann introduced Abstract Kleisli structures to model call-by-value programming languages with side effects, and showed that they correspond to monads satisfying a certain equalising condition on the unit. We first extend this theory to non-strict morphisms of monads, and to incorporate $2$-cells of monads. We then further extend this to a theory of abstract Kleisli structures on $2$-categories, characterising when the original pseudomonad can be recovered by the abstract Kleisli structure on its $2$-category of free-pseudoalgebras.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck Construction for $\infty$-Categories Fibered over Categorical Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to treat families of $\infty$-categories fibered in categorical patterns (e.g., $\infty$-operads and monoidal $\infty$-categories) in terms of fibrations by relativizing the Grothendieck construction. As applications, we construct an analog of the universal cocartesian fibration and explain how to compute limits and colimits of $\infty$-categories fibered in categorical patterns.</description>

      <title>An $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal Grothendieck construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an operad $\mathcal{O}$, we define a notion of weak $\mathcal{O}$-monoids -- which we term $\mathcal{O}$-pseudomonoids -- in a 2-category. In the special case with the 2-category in question is the 2-category $\mathsf{Cat}$ of categories, this yields a notion of $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal category, which in the case of the associative and commutative operads retrieves unbiased notions of monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories, respectively. We carefully unpack the definition of $\mathcal{O}$-monoids in the 2-categories of discrete fibrations and of category-indexed sets. Using the classical Grothendieck construction, we thereby obtain an $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal Grothendieck construction relating lax $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal functors into Set to strict $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal functors which are also discrete fibrations.</description>

      <title>The pullback theorem for relative monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental result in the theory of monads is the characterisation of the category of algebras for a monad in terms of a pullback of the category of presheaves on the category of free algebras: intuitively, this expresses that every algebra is a colimit of free algebras. We establish an analogous result for enriched relative monads with dense roots, and explain how it generalises the nerve theorems for monads with arities and nervous monads. As an application, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of algebraic colimits of relative monads. More generally, we show that the pullback theorem for relative monads holds in any exact virtual equipment. In doing so, we are led to study the relationship between a $j$-relative monad $T$ and its associated loose-monad $E(j, T)$, and consequently show that the opalgebra object and the algebra object for $T$ may be constructed from certain double categorical limits and colimits associated to $E(j, T)$.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between Composite Theories and Distributive Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite theories are the algebraic equivalent of distributive laws. In this paper, we delve into the details of this correspondence and concretely show how to construct a composite theory from a distributive law and vice versa. Using term rewriting methods, we also describe when a minimal set of equations axiomatises the composite theory.</description>

      <title>A new approach to flatness in categories of sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, many authors have embraced the study of certain properties of modules such as projectivity, injectivity and flatness from an alternative point of view. This way, Durgun has introduced absolutely pure domains of modules as a mean to gauge the extent of the flatness of any given module (so not just to determine whether or not the module is flat). In this paper, we develop a new treatment of the goemetric flatness in categories of sheaves which shed more light on some of its various important aspects. Namely, in terms of this new approach, some classical schemes are characterized, some new results are established and also known ones are generalized.</description>

      <title>The 2-character theory for finite 2-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the notion of character for 2-representations of finite 2-groups. The properties of 2-characters bear strong similarities to those classical characters of finite groups, including conjugation invariance, additivity, multiplicativity and orthogonality. With a careful analysis using homotopy fixed points and quotients for categories with 2-group actions, we prove that the category of class functors on a 2-group $\mathcal G$ is equivalent to the Drinfeld center of the 2-group algebra $\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G}$, which categorifies the Fourier transform on finite abelian groups. After transferring the canonical nondegenerate braided monoidal structure from $\mathfrak Z_1(\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G})$, we discover that irreducible 2-characters of $\mathcal G$ coincide with full centers of the corresponding 2-representations, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with Lagrangian algebras in the category of class functors on $\mathcal G$. In particular, the fusion rule of $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal G)$ can be calculated from the pointwise product of Lagrangian algebras as class functors. From a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) point of view, the commutative Frobenius algebra structure on a 2-character is induced from a 2D topological sigma-model with target space $\lvert \mathrm{B} \mathcal G \rvert$.</description>

      <title>Singularity categories via McKay quivers with potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2018, Kalck-Yang showed that the singularity categories associated with 3-dimensional Gorenstein quotient singularities are (up to direct summands) triangle equivalent to small cluster categories associated with McKay quivers with potential. We introduce (graded) McKay quivers with potential and generalize Kalck-Yang's theorem to arbitrary dimensions. Moreover, we characterize the singularity categories in the non-Gorenstein case. More generally, singularity categories have a relative variant known as categories of Cohen-Macaulay modules. We also prove the relative variant of the structure theorem.</description>

      <title>The formal theory of relative monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of relative monads and relative adjunctions in a virtual equipment, extending the theory of monads and adjunctions in a 2-category. The theory of relative comonads and relative coadjunctions follows by duality. While some aspects of the theory behave analogously to the non-relative setting, others require new insights. In particular, the universal properties that define the algebra object and the opalgebra object for a monad in a virtual equipment are stronger than the classical notions of algebra object and opalgebra object for a monad in a 2-category. Inter alia, we prove a number of representation theorems for relative monads, establishing the unity of several concepts in the literature, including the devices of Walters, the $j$-monads of Diers, and the relative monads of Altenkirch, Chapman, and Uustalu. A motivating setting is the virtual equipment $\mathbb{V}\text{-}\mathbf{Cat}$ of categories enriched in a monoidal category $\mathbb{V}$, though many of our results are new even for $\mathbb{V} = \mathbf{Set}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a relative monadicity theorem for relative monads with dense roots in a virtual equipment, specialising to a relative monadicity theorem for enriched relative monads. In particular, for a dense $\mathbb V$-functor $j \colon A \to E$, a $\mathbb V$-functor $r \colon D \to E$ is $j$-monadic if and only if $r$ admits a left $j$-relative adjoint and creates $j$-absolute colimits. Furthermore, we examine the interaction between the pasting law for relative adjunctions and relative monadicity. As a consequence, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the ($j$-)monadicity of the composite of a $\mathbb V$-functor with a ($j$-)monadic $\mathbb V$-functor.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>

Abstract: We survey recent developments in a novel kind of generalized global symmetry, the non-invertible symmetry, in diverse spacetime dimensions. We start with several different but related constructions of the non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry in the Ising model, and conclude with a new interpretation for the neutral pion decay and other applications. These notes are based on lectures given at the TASI 2023 summer school "Aspects of Symmetry."</description>

Abstract: We develop Weiss's manifold calculus in the setting of $\infty$-categories, where we allow the target $\infty$-category to be any $\infty$-category with small limits. We will establish the connection between polynomial functors, Kan extensions, and Weiss sheaves, and will classify homogeneous functors. We will also generalize Weiss and Boavida de Brito's theorem to functors taking values in arbitrary $\infty$-categories with small limits.</description>
