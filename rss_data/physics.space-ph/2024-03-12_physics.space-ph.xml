      <title>Beam-driven Electron Cyclotron Harmonic and Whistler-mode Waves as Seen in Particle-In-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent study has demonstrated that electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves can be excited by a low energy electron beam. Such waves propagate at moderately oblique wave normal angles ~70. The potential role of beam-driven ECH waves in affecting electron dynamics in Earth's plasma sheet is not known. Using two-dimensional Darwin particle-in-cell simulations with initial electron distributions that represent typical plasma conditions in the plasma sheet, we explore the excitation and saturation of such beam-driven ECH waves. Both ECH and whistler-mode waves are excited in the simulation and propagate at oblique wave normal angles. Compared with the whistler-mode waves, ECH waves grow much faster and have more intense saturation amplitudes. Cold, stationary electrons are first accelerated by ECH waves through cyclotron resonance and then accelerated in the parallel direction by both the ECH and whistler-mode waves through Landau resonance. Beam electrons, on the other hand, are decelerated in the parallel direction and scattered to larger pitch angles. The relaxation of the electron beam and the continuous heating of the cold electrons contribute to the saturation of ECH waves and suppress the excitation of whistler-mode waves. When the ratio of plasma to electron cyclotron frequency wpe/wce increases, the ECH wave amplitude increases while the whistler-mode wave amplitude decreases. Our work reveals the importance of ECH and whistler-mode waves in reshaping sub-thermal electron distributions and improves our understanding on the potential effects of wave-particle interactions in trapping ionospheric electron outflows and forming anisotropic (field-aligned) electron distributions in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Observations of Meteor Radio Afterglows with the OVRO-LWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted an all-sky imaging transient search with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) data collected during the Perseid meteor shower in 2018. The data collection during the meteor shower was motivated to conduct a search for intrinsic radio emission from meteors below 60 MHz known as the meteor radio afterglows (MRAs). The data collected were calibrated and imaged using the core array to obtain lower angular resolution images of the sky. These images were input to a pre-existing LWA transient search pipeline to search for MRAs as well as cosmic radio transients. This search detected 5 MRAs and did not find any cosmic transients. We further conducted peeling of bright sources, near-field correction, visibility differencing and higher angular resolution imaging using the full array for these 5 MRAs. These higher angular resolution images were used to study their plasma emission structures and monitor their evolution as a function of frequency and time. With higher angular resolution imaging, we resolved the radio emission size scales to less than 1 km physical size at 100 km heights. The spectral index mapping of one of the long duration event showed signs of diffusion of plasma within the meteor trails. The unpolarized emission from the resolved radio components suggest resonant transition radiation as the possible radiation mechanism of MRAs.</description>

      <title>Interaction between a Coronal Mass Ejection and Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and a comet has been observed several times by in-situ observations from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC), which is designed to investigate the cometary magnetosphere of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG). Goetz et al. (2019) reported a magnetic field of up to 300 nT measured in the inner coma, which is among the largest interplanetary magnetic fields observed in the solar system. They suggested the large magnetic field observations in the inner coma come from magnetic field pile-up regions, which are generated by the interaction between a CME and/or corotating interaction region and the cometary magnetosphere. However, the detailed interaction between a CME and the cometary magnetosphere of comet CG in the inner coma has not been investigated by numerical simulations yet. In this manuscript, we will use a numerical model to simulate the interaction between comet CG and a Halloween class CME and investigate its magnetospheric response to the CME. We find that the plasma structures change significantly during the CME event, and the maximum value of the magnetic field strength is more than 500nT close to the nucleus. Virtual satellites at similar distances as Rosetta show that the magnetic field strength can be as large as 250nT, which is slightly less than what Goetz et al. (2019) reported.</description>

      <title>Six Hypotheses for Accelerating the Lunar Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on technical work and development conducted under the LunA-10 study, I have identified six hypotheses where, if revolutionary improvements in technology can be made, I assess that a direct acceleration to the fielding of a lunar economy is likely to occur. In this short paper, I explain these six hypotheses, and recommend that these topics be focused on for technical development in the near-future by government and commercial stakeholders. These areas are: (1) Centralized thermal rejection and generation as a service, (2) Widespread orbital lunar prospecting and surveying, (3) Creating large silicon wafers for microsystems on the Moon, (4) Biomanufacturing to accelerate lunar construction, (5) New concepts to increase refinement rates in low gravity, (6) New concepts for Lunar Position, Navigation and Timing.</description>

      <title>A New Mechanism For Generating Type-III Radiation From The Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because the conventional method of creating type-III radiation by coalescence of counter-propagating Langmuir waves has not been verified with in-situ data, Parker Solar Probe data was examined in search of such in-situ evidence, which was not found. Instead, a new mechanism for creating type-III radiation has been found as a result of observing slow Langmuir waves (~2200 km/sec) with electric fields as large as 300 mV/m during a developing type-III burst on March 21, 2023. Because of their slow phase velocities, these Langmuir waves had short wavelengths, several times the Debye length of 2.65 meters, and, as a result, k{\lambda}d~0.93. Such waves may be strongly damped to be replaced by new growing bursts of waves that create the characteristic Langmuir waveform that is composed of peaks and valleys of a few milliseconds duration. The average electron current that produced these Langmuir waves is estimated from the Generalized Ohms law to be ~15 microamps/m2 and, from the strahl, 8 microamps/m2. Peak currents were at least twice these averages. These Langmuir waves, acting as antennas, produced electrostatic harmonics having slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 6.28*125 kHz is the Langmuir wave frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Such waves are not the type-III emission. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through the huge density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the solar cycle variability using nonlinear time series analysis at different amounts of dynamo supercriticality: Solar dynamo is not highly supercritical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar dynamo is essentially a cyclic process in which the toroidal component of the magnetic field is converted into the poloidal one and vice versa. This cyclic loop is disturbed by some nonlinear and stochastic processes mainly operating in the toroidal to poloidal part. Hence, the memory of the polar field decreases in every cycle. On the other hand, the dynamo efficiency and, thus, the supercriticality of the dynamo decreases with the Sun's age. Previous studies have shown that the memory of the polar magnetic field decreases with the increase of supercriticality of the dynamo. In this study, we employ popular techniques of time series analysis, namely, compute Higuchi's fractal dimension, Hurst exponent, and Multi-Fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, to the amplitude of the solar magnetic cycle obtained from dynamo models operating at near-critical and supercritical regimes. We show that the magnetic field in the near-critical regime is governed by strong memory, less stochasticity, intermittency, and breakdown of self-similarity. On the contrary, the magnetic field in the supercritical region has less memory, strong stochasticity, and shows a good amount of self-similarity. Finally, applying the same time series analysis techniques in the reconstructed sunspot data of 85 cycles and comparing their results with that from models, we conclude that the solar dynamo is possibly operating near the critical regime and not too much supercritical regime. Thus Sun may not be too far from the critical dynamo transition.</description>

      <title>HINORA, a method for detecting ring-like structures in 3D point distributions I: application to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method - called HINORA (HIgh-NOise RANdom SAmple Consensus) - for the identification of regular structures in 3D point distributions. Motivated by the possible existence of the so called Council of Giants, i.e. a ring of twelve massive galaxies surrounding the Local Group in the Local Sheet with a radius of 3.75 Mpc, we apply HINORA to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue confirming its existence. When varying the lower limit of K-band luminosity of the galaxy entering the catalogue, we further report on the existence of another ring-like structure in the Local Volume that now contains the Milky Way and M31. However, this newly found structure is dominated by low-mass (satellite) galaxies. While we here simply present the novel method as well as its first application to observational data, follow-up work using numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation shall shed light into the origin of such regular patterns in the galaxy distribution. Further, the method is equally suited to identify similar (or even different) structures in various kinds of astrophysical data (e.g. locating the actual 'baryonic-acoustic oscillation spheres' in galaxy redshift surveys).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propagate relativistic test particles in the field of a steady 3D MHD simulations of the solar wind. We use the MPI-AMRVAC code for the wind simulations and integrate the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order accurate time integration scheme to solve the particle trajectories. Diffusion in velocity space, given a particle-turbulence mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$ along the magnetic field, is also included. Preliminary results for $81\:{\rm keV}$ electrons injected at 0.139 AU heliocentric distance and mean free path $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$ are in a good qualitative agreement with measurements at 1 AU.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant scattering of energetic electrons by electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves: spacecraft observations and theoretical framework</title>

Abstract: Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves lead to rapid scattering of relativistic electrons in Earth's radiation belts, due to their large amplitudes relative to other waves that interact with electrons of this energy range. A central feature of electron precipitation driven by EMIC waves is deeply elusive. That is, moderate precipitating fluxes at energies below the minimum resonance energy of EMIC waves occur concurrently with strong precipitating fluxes at resonance energies in low-altitude spacecraft observations. This paper expands on a previously reported solution to this problem: nonresonant scattering due to wave packets. The quasi-linear diffusion model is generalized to incorporate nonresonant scattering by a generic wave shape. The diffusion rate decays exponentially away from the resonance, where shorter packets lower decay rates and thus widen the energy range of significant scattering. Using realistic EMIC wave packets from $\delta f$ particle-in-cell simulations, test particle simulations are performed to demonstrate that intense, short packets extend the energy of significant scattering well below the minimum resonance energy, consistent with our theoretical prediction. Finally, the calculated precipitating-to-trapped flux ratio of relativistic electrons is compared to ELFIN observations, and the wave power spectra is inferred based on the measured flux ratio. We demonstrate that even with a narrow wave spectrum, short EMIC wave packets can provide moderately intense precipitating fluxes well below the minimum resonance energy.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Particle Charge States and Abundances with Nonthermal Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various kappa values in a kappa function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme kappa distribution are about 10-30%. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various kappa values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization time scale.</description>
