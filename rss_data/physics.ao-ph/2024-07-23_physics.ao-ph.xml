      <title>Evapotranspiration trends over the last 300 years reconstructed from historical weather station observations via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating historical evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for understanding the effects of climate change and human activities on the water cycle. This study used historical weather station data to reconstruct ET trends over the past 300 years with machine learning. A Random Forest model, trained on FLUXNET2015 flux stations' monthly data using precipitation, temperature, aridity index, and rooting depth as predictors, achieved an R2 of 0.66 and a KGE of 0.76 through 10-fold cross-validation. Applied to 5267 weather stations, the model produced monthly ET data showing a general increase in global ET from 1700 to the present, with a notable acceleration after 1900 due to warming. Regional differences were observed, with higher ET increases in mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and decreases in some mid-to-low latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere. In drylands, ET and temperature were weakly correlated, while in humid areas, the correlation was much higher. The correlation between ET and precipitation has remained stable over the centuries. This study extends the ET data time span, providing valuable insights into long-term historical ET trends and their drivers, aiding in reassessing the impact of historical climate change and human activities on the water cycle and supporting future climate adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>Advances in Land Surface Model-based Forecasting: A comparative study of LSTM, Gradient Boosting, and Feedforward Neural Network Models as prognostic state emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most useful weather prediction for the public is near the surface. The processes that are most relevant for near-surface weather prediction are also those that are most interactive and exhibit positive feedback or have key role in energy partitioning. Land surface models (LSMs) consider these processes together with surface heterogeneity and forecast water, carbon and energy fluxes, and coupled with an atmospheric model provide boundary and initial conditions. This numerical parametrization of atmospheric boundaries being computationally expensive, statistical surrogate models are increasingly used to accelerated progress in experimental research. We evaluated the efficiency of three surrogate models in speeding up experimental research by simulating land surface processes, which are integral to forecasting water, carbon, and energy fluxes in coupled atmospheric models. Specifically, we compared the performance of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder network, extreme gradient boosting, and a feed-forward neural network within a physics-informed multi-objective framework. This framework emulates key states of the ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) land surface scheme, ECLand, across continental and global scales. Our findings indicate that while all models on average demonstrate high accuracy over the forecast period, the LSTM network excels in continental long-range predictions when carefully tuned, the XGB scores consistently high across tasks and the MLP provides an excellent implementation-time-accuracy trade-off. The runtime reduction achieved by the emulators in comparison to the full numerical models are significant, offering a faster, yet reliable alternative for conducting numerical experiments on land surfaces.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of deep learning models for Australian climate extremes: prediction of streamflow and floods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, climate extremes such as floods have created significant environmental and economic hazards for Australia, causing damage to the environment and economy and losses of human and animal lives. An efficient method of forecasting floods is crucial to limit this damage. Techniques for flood prediction are currently based on hydrological, and hydrodynamic (physically-based) numerical models. Machine learning methods that include deep learning offer certain advantages over conventional physically based approaches, including flexibility and accuracy. Deep learning methods have been promising for predicting small to medium-sized climate extreme events over a short time horizon; however, large flooding events present a critical challenge. We present an ensemble-based machine learning approach that addresses large-scale extreme flooding challenges using a switching mechanism motivated by extreme-value theory for long-short-term-memory (LSTM) deep learning models. We use a multivariate and multi-step time-series prediction approach to predict streamflow for multiple days ahead in the major catchments of Australia. The ensemble framework also employs static information to enrich the time-series information, allowing for regional modelling across catchments. Our results demonstrate enhanced prediction of streamflow extremes, with notable efficacy for large flooding scenarios in the selected Australian catchments. Through comparative analysis, our methodology underscores the potential for deep learning models to revolutionise flood forecasting across diverse regions.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial echoes of ageostrophic instability in submesoscale filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocean submesoscales, flows with characteristic size around 10m--10km, are transitional between the larger, rotationally-constrained mesoscale and three-dimensional turbulence. In this paper we present simulations of a submesoscale ocean filament. The strong vertical transport associated with submesoscale fronts and filaments ventilates the deeper water and provides a route for the observed forward cascade of energy in the ocean. In our case, the filament is strongly sheared in both vertical and cross-filament directions and is unstable. Instability indeed dominates the early behaviour with a fast extraction of kinetic energy from the vertically sheared thermal wind. The filament is expected to be subject to instabilities, including symmetric and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. An instability emerges with a circulation that does not match either, though symmetric modes become apparent later. The action of the instability is sufficiently rapid that the filament does not respond in a geostrophically balanced sense. Instead, it later exhibits vertically sheared near-inertial oscillations with higher amplitude as the initial minimum Richardson number decreases. Horizontal gradients strengthen only briefly as the fronts restratify. These unstable filaments can be generated by strong mixing events at pre-existing stable structures. The oscillations must also be considered when designing initial conditions for numerical experiments of submesoscale flows, where the initial state is intended to be balanced.</description>

      <title>Assessing the climate benefits of afforestation: phenomenology, processes, methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Afforestation greatly influences several earth system processes, making it essential to understand these effects to accurately assess its potential for climate change mitigation. Although our understanding of forest-climate interactions has improved, significant knowledge gaps remain, preventing definitive assessments of afforestation's net climate benefits. In this review, focusing on the Canadian boreal, we identify these gaps and synthesize existing knowledge. The review highlights regional realities, Earth's climatic history, uncertainties in biogeochemical (BGC) and biogeophysical (BGP) changes following afforestation, and limitations in current assessment methodologies, emphasizing the need to reconcile these uncertainties before drawing firm conclusions about the climate benefits of afforestation. We hope that the identified gaps will drive the development of a more informed decision-making framework for Canadian afforestation policy, one that considers regional and future climatic contexts. Although we use the Canadian boreal as an example, most arguments in this review are applicable across the globe, particularly for the circumpolar nations.</description>

      <title>Time correlations in atmospheric quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient transfer of quantum information between remote parties is a crucial challenge for quantum communication over atmospheric channels. Random fluctuations of the channel transmittance are a major disturbing factor for its practical implementation. We study correlations between channel transmittances at different moments of time and focus on two transmission protocols. The first is related to the robustness of both discrete- and continuous-variable entanglement between time-separated light pulses, showing a possibility to enlarge the effective dimension of the Hilbert space. The second addresses a selection of high-transmittance events by testing them with bright classical pulses followed by quantum light. Our results show a high capacity of the time-coherence resource for encoding and transferring quantum states of light in atmospheric channels.</description>
