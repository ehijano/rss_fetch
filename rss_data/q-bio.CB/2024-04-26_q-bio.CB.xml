      <title>Unraveling cell-cell communication with NicheNet by inferring active ligands from transcriptomics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ligand-receptor interactions constitute a fundamental mechanism of cell-cell communication and signaling. NicheNet is a well-established computational tool that infers ligand-receptor interactions that potentially regulate gene expression changes in receiver cell populations. Whereas the original publication delves into the algorithm and validation, this paper describes a best practices workflow cultivated over four years of experience and user feedback. Starting from the input single-cell expression matrix, we describe a "sender-agnostic" approach which considers ligands from the entire microenvironment, and a "sender-focused" approach which only considers ligands from cell populations of interest. As output, users will obtain a list of prioritized ligands and their potential target genes, along with multiple visualizations. In NicheNet v2, we have updated the data sources and implemented a downstream procedure for prioritizing cell-type-specific ligand-receptor pairs. Although a standard NicheNet analysis takes less than 10 minutes to run, users often invest additional time in making decisions about the approach and parameters that best suit their biological question. This paper serves to aid in this decision-making process by describing the most appropriate workflow for common experimental designs like case-control and cell differentiation studies. Finally, in addition to the step-by-step description of the code, we also provide wrapper functions that enable the analysis to be run in one line of code, thus tailoring the workflow to users at all levels of computational proficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale modeling of Snail-mediated response to hypoxia in tumor progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor cell migration within the microenvironment is a crucial aspect for cancer progression and, in this context, hypoxia has a significant role. An inadequate oxygen supply acts as an environmental stressor inducing migratory bias and phenotypic changes. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale mathematical model to analyze the pivotal role of Snail protein expression in the cellular responses to hypoxia. Starting from the description of single-cell dynamics driven by the Snail protein, we construct the corresponding kinetic transport equation that describes the evolution of the cell distribution. Subsequently, we employ proper scaling arguments to formally derive the equations for the statistical moments of the cell distribution, which govern the macroscopic tumor dynamics. Numerical simulations of the model are performed in various scenarios with biological relevance to provide insights into the role of the multiple tactic terms, the impact of Snail expression on cell proliferation, and the emergence of hypoxia-induced migration patterns. Moreover, quantitative comparison with experimental data shows the model's reliability in measuring the impact of Snail transcription on cell migratory potential. Through our findings, we shed light on the potential of our mathematical framework in advancing the understanding of the biological mechanisms driving tumor progression.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling of glioma invasion and therapy approaches via kinetic theory of active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multiscale model for glioma spread in brain tissue under the influence of vascularization and vascular endothelial growth factors is proposed. It accounts for the interplay between the different components of the neoplasm and the healthy tissue and it investigates and compares various therapy approaches. Precisely, these involve radio- and chemotherapy in a concurrent or adjuvant manner together with anti-angiogenic therapy affecting the vascular component of the system. We assess tumor growth and spread on the basis of DTI data, which allows us to reconstruct a realistic brain geometry and tissue structure, and we apply our model to real glioma patient data. In this latter case, a space-dependent radiotherapy description is considered using data about the corresponding isodose curves.</description>
