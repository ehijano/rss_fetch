      <title>Recurrence Plots for the Analysis of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Data-driven nonlinear modal identification of nonlinear dynamical systems with physics-constrained Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the intrinsic coordinates or modes of the dynamical systems is essential to understand, analyze, and characterize the underlying dynamical behaviors of complex systems. For nonlinear dynamical systems, this presents a critical challenge as the linear modal transformation, which is universal for linear systems, does not apply to nonlinear dynamical systems. As natural extensions to linear normal modes,the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) framework provides a comprehensive representation of nonlinear dynamics. Theoretically, NNMs may either be computed numerically or analytically from the closed-form models or equations of dynamical systems, or experimentally identified from controllable input-output tests, both of which, however, are typically unknown or unavailable practically. In this study, we present a physics-integrated Normalizing Flows deep learning-based data-driven approach which identifies the NNMs and the nonlinear modal transformation function of NNMs using measured response data only. Specifically, we leverage the unique features of the Normalizing Flows model: 1) the independent latent spaces, naturally spanned by the Normalizing Flows, are exploited to facilitate nonlinear modal decomposition; 2) the invertible transformation through the Normalizing Flows, enabling efficient and accurate nonlinear transformation between original and modal coordinates transformation. Therefore, our framework leverages the independency feature and invertibility of Normalizing Flows to create a model that captures the dynamics of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital Dynamics of Atlas (S XV): Its Current Orbit and the Recent Past</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study comprehensively analyzes Atlas's current orbit, focusing on the secular and resonant perturbations caused by Prometheus, Pandora, and Saturn's oblateness. We performed numerical integration of the exact equations of motion for a dense ensemble of Atlas clone satellites. Through spectral analysis and interpretation of these orbits on dynamical maps, we identified the domain of the 54:53 Prometheus-Atlas and 70:67 Pandora-Atlas mean-motion resonances, showing that Atlas lies on the boundary of the separatrices of each of these resonances. We also identified the domains for the multiplets $\Psi_{1}$, $\Psi_{2}$, $\Psi_{3}$ and $\Psi_{4}$ associated with 70:67 resonance. Additionally, we explored the variation in Prometheus's eccentricity, demonstrating that as eccentricity increases (or decreases) in the 54:53 resonance domain correspondingly decreases (or increases). This combined analysis, between the above mappings, revealed qualitatively the overlap between the 54:53 and 70:67 resonances, which are responsible for the chaotic behavior of Atlas's orbit. We quantified chaotic motion in frequency space and found that the vicinity of Atlas is characterized by weak to moderate chaos, rather than strong chaos. Finally, we investigated Atlas's recent past, considering Prometheus's migration under the influence of Saturn's tidal forces. This analysis reveals several resonances crossed in the past, particularly focusing on the Atlas-Prometheus pair, which exhibited a co-orbital configuration.</description>
