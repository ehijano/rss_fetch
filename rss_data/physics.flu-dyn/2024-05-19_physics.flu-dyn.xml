      <title>A semi-analytical transient undisturbed velocity correction scheme for wall-bounded two-way coupled Euler-Lagrange simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we model the velocity disturbance generated by a regularized forcing near a planar wall, which, along with the temporal nature of the forcing, provides an estimate of the unsteady velocity disturbance of the particle near a planar wall. We use the analytical solution for a singular in-time transient Stokeslet near a planar wall (Felderhof, 2009) and derive the corresponding time-persistent Stokeslets. The velocity disturbance due to a regularized forcing is then obtained numerically via a discrete convolution with the regularization kernel. The resulting Green's functions for parallel and perpendicular regularized forcing to the wall are stored as pre-computed temporal correction maps. By storing the time-dependent particle force on the fluid as fictitious particles, we estimate the unsteady velocity disturbance generated by the particle as a scalar product between the stored forces and the pre-computed Green's functions. Since the model depends on the analytical Green's function solution of the singular Stokeslet near a planar wall, the obtained velocity disturbance exactly satisfies the no-slip condition and does not require any fitted parameters to account for the rapid decay of the disturbance near the wall. The numerical evaluation of the convolution integral makes the present method suitable for arbitrary regularization kernels. Additionally, the generation of parallel and perpendicular correction maps enables to estimate the velocity disturbance due to particle motion in arbitrary directions relative to the local flow. The convergence of the method is studied on a fixed particle near a planar wall, and verification tests are performed on a settling particle parallel to a wall and a free-falling particle perpendicular to the wall.</description>

      <title>Intermittency of inter-scale kinetic energy transfer and of energy exchange between internal and kinetic energy in turbulent premixed flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-scale kinetic energy transfer in turbulent flows is accompanied by very intense and intermittent spatial-temporal fluctuations. Such intermittency is expected to be particularly prominent in premixed flames, where heat release, density variations, dilatation, and chemical reactions are localized to spatial scales that are substantially smaller than scales of large turbulent eddies but are often larger than or comparable with Kolmogorov length scale. Nevertheless, intermittency of inter-scale energy transfer and of heat exchange between internal and kinetic energy in premixed flames has not yet been given due attention. The present work aims at bridging this knowledge gap. For this purpose, three-dimensional direct numerical simulation data obtained earlier from a statistically stationary, planar, one-dimensional lean hydrogen-air flame propagating in moderately intense turbulence are filtered using cubes of various widths. Subsequently, Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of various instantaneous flow characteristics are sampled by processing the filtered fields of velocity, pressure, density, and their spatial gradients. The sampled PDFs exhibit long tails, are highly skewed, and are characterized by a large kurtosis, thus, evidencing significant intermittency of inter-scale energy transfer and heat exchange between internal and kinetic energy in the flame.</description>

      <title>Data-driven low-dimensional model of a sedimenting flexible fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of flexible filaments entrained in flow, important for understanding many biological and industrial processes, are computationally expensive to model with full-physics simulations. This work describes a data-driven technique to create high-fidelity low-dimensional models of flexible fiber dynamics using machine learning; the technique is applied to sedimentation in a quiescent, viscous Newtonian fluid, using results from detailed simulations as the data set. The approach combines an autoencoder neural network architecture to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the filament shape, with a neural ODE that learns the evolution of the particle in the latent state. The model was designed to model filaments of varying flexibility, characterized by an elasto-gravitational number $\mathcal{B}$, and was trained on a data set containing the evolution of fibers beginning at set angles of inclination. For the range of $\mathcal{B}$ considered here (100-10000), the filament shape dynamics can be represented with high accuracy with only four degrees of freedom, in contrast to the 93 present in the original bead-spring model used to generate the dynamic trajectories. We predict the evolution of fibers set at arbitrary angles and demonstrate that our data-driven model can accurately forecast the evolution of a fiber at both trained and untrained elasto-gravitational numbers.</description>

      <title>Triple decomposition and sparse representation for noisy pressure-sensitive paint data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple decomposition is a useful analytical method for extracting the mean value, organized coherent motion, and stochastic part from a fluctuating quantity. Although the pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) method is widely used to measure the pressure distribution on a surface, the PSP data measuring near atmospheric pressure contain significant noise. Here, we perform triple decomposition of noisy PSP data. To construct phase-averaged data representing an organized coherent motion, we propose a relatively simple method based on a multi-dimensional scaling plot of the cosine similarity between each PSP datum. Then, the stochastic part is extracted by selecting phase-averaged data with an appropriate phase angle based on the similarity between the measurement and phase-averaged data. As a data-driven approach, we also reconstruct the pressure distribution based on the triple decomposition and the pressure data at sparse optimal sensor positions determined from the proper orthogonal decomposition modes of the stochastic part. The optimal sensor positions are determined as a combinatorial optimization problem and are estimated using Fujitsu computing as a service digital annealer. Based on the results obtained, the root mean square error between the pressure measured by a pressure transducer and the reconstructed pressure obtained by the proposed method is small, even when the number of modes and sensor points is small. The application of PSP measurement is expected to expand further, and the framework for calculating triple decomposition and sparse representation based on the decomposition will be useful for flow analysis.</description>

      <title>Multiple states of two-dimensional turbulence above topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent work of Siegelman \&amp; Young (PNAS, vol. 120(44), 2023, pp. e2308018120) revealed two extreme states reached by the evolution of unforced and weakly-damped two-dimensional turbulence above random rough topography, separated by a critical kinetic energy $E_\#$. The low- and high-energy solutions correspond to topographically-locked and roaming vortices, surrounded by non-uniform and homogeneous background potential vorticity (PV), respectively. However, we found that these phenomena are restricted to the particular intermediate length scale where the energy was initially injected into the system. Through simulations initialised by injecting the energy at larger and smaller length scales, we found that the long-term state of topographic turbulence is also dependent on the initial length scale. If the initial length scale is comparable with the domain size, the flow field evolves to the minimum-enstrophy state proposed by Bretherton and Haidvogel (J. Fluid Mech., vol.78(1), 1976, pp. 129-154), without the presence of vortices, especially when the energy is no larger than $E_\#$. As the initial length scale becomes smaller, more vortices nucleate, and become more mobile. Simultaneously, the background PV tends to homogenization, even if the energy is below $E_\#$. These results complement the phenomenology of topographic turbulence documented by Siegelman \&amp; Young, by showing that the minimum-enstrophy and background PV homogenization states can be reached by large- and small-scale initial fields, respectively, whatever the energy is.</description>

Abstract: Hodograph equations for the n-dimensional Euler equations with the constant pressure and external force linear in velocity are presented. They provide us with solutions of the Euler in implicit form and information on existence or absence of gradient catastrophes. It is shown that in even dimensions the constructed solutions are periodic in time for particular subclasses of external forces. Several particular examples in one, two and three dimensions are considered, including the case of Coriolis external force.</description>

      <title>Modal decomposition of nonlinear interactions in wall turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent structures are found in many different turbulent flows and are known to drive self-sustaining processes in wall turbulence. Identifying the triadic interactions which generate coherent structures can provide insights beyond what is possible with linearized models. There are infinite possible interactions that may generate a given structure. Thus, a method to systematically study those, ranking them in terms of their contribution to the structure of interest, is essential. We here use the resolvent-based extended spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (RESPOD) approach (Karban, U. et al. 2022 Self-similar mechanisms in wall turbulence studied using resolvent analysis. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 969, A36) to rank the triadic interactions which give rise to the dominant coherent structures in minimal Couette flows at Reynolds number 400 and 1000. Our analysis identifies that six triadic interactions dominate the most energetic coherent structure, revealing the capability of the methodology to identify and rank nonlinear interactions. The approach can be used to analyse the energy exchange in turbulent flows and may guide the construction of reduced-order models based on the interplay between different flow modes. Based on this framework, we introduce a modelling strategy where the interactions increasing or reducing the energy of a given mode are grouped as sources and sinks, respectively. The effect of the sinks is embedded in the resolvent operator by using an eddy viscosity model. The sources are used for driving this modified resolvent operator and are shown to yield accurate flow predictions at zero frequency. We discuss that this strategy can be useful when analysing nonlinear interactions or modelling forcing at high-Reynolds-number flows.</description>

      <title>Mapping flagellated swimmers to surface-slip driven swimmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flagellated microswimmers are ubiquitous in natural habitats. Understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of these cells is of paramount interest, owing to their applications in bio-medical engineering and disease spreading. Since the last two decades, computational efforts have been continuously improved to accurately capture the complex hydrodynamic behavior of these model systems. However, modeling the dynamics of such swimmers with fine details is computationally expensive due to the large number of unknowns and the small time-steps required to solve the equations. In this work we propose a method to map fully resolved flagellated microswimmers to coarse, active slip driven swimmers which can be simulated at a reduced computational cost. Using the new method, the slip driven swimmers move with the same velocity, to machine precision, as the flagellated swimmers and generate a similar flow field with a controlled accuracy. The method is validated for swimming patterns near a no-slip boundary, interactions between swimmers and scattering with large obstacles.</description>

      <title>Two-interface and thin filament approximation in Hele--Shaw channel flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a viscous fluid partially fills a Hele--Shaw channel, and is pushed by a pressure difference, the fluid interface is unstable due to the Saffman--Taylor instability. We consider the evolution of a fluid region of finite extent, bounded between two interfaces, in the limit the interfaces are close, that is, when the fluid region is a thin liquid filament separating two gases of different pressure. In this limit, we derive a second-order `thin filament' model that describes the normal velocity of the filament centreline, and evolution of the filament thickness, as functions of the thickness, centreline curvature and their derivatives. We show that the second-order terms in this model, that include the effect of transverse flow along the filament, are necessary to regularise the instability. Numerical simulation of the thin filament model is shown to be in accordance with level-set computations of the complete two-interface model. Solutions ultimately evolve to form a bubble of rapidly increasing radius and decreasing thickness.</description>

      <title>Variational Mode Decomposition-Based Nonstationary Coherent Structure Analysis for Spatiotemporal Data</title>

Abstract: The conventional modal analysis techniques face difficulties in handling nonstationary phenomena, such as transient, nonperiodic, or intermittent phenomena. This paper presents a variational mode decomposition--based nonstationary coherent structure (VMD-NCS) analysis that enables the extraction and analysis of coherent structures in the case of nonstationary phenomena from high-dimensional spatiotemporal data. The VMD-NCS analysis decomposes the input spatiotemporal data into intrinsic coherent structures (ICSs) that represent nonstationary spatiotemporal patterns and exhibit coherence in both spatial and temporal directions. Unlike many conventional modal analysis techniques, the proposed method accounts for the temporal changes in the spatial distribution with time. Tthe VMD-NCS analysis was validated based on the transient growth phenomena in the flow around a cylinder. It was confirmed that the temporal changes in the spatial distribution, depicting the transient growth of vortex shedding where fluctuations arising in the far-wake region gradually approach the near-wake region, were represented as a single ICS. Furthermore, in the analysis of the quasi-periodic flow field around a pitching airfoil, the temporal changes in the spatial distribution and the amplitude of vortex shedding behind the airfoil, influenced by the pitching motion of the airfoil, were captured as a single ICS. The impact of two parameters that control the number of ICSs ($K$) and the penalty factor related to the temporal coherence ($\alpha$), was investigated. The results revealed that $K$ has a significant impact on the VMD-NCS analysis results. In the case of a relatively high $K$, the VMD-NCS analysis tends to extract more periodic spatiotemporal patterns resembling the results of dynamic mode decomposition. In the case of a small $K$, it tends to extract more nonstationary spatiotemporal patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the realization of digital twins (DT) from various perspectives. First, various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with $42\sim62\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning methods have seen a wide range of successful applications across different industries. Up until now, applications to physical simulations such as CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), have been limited to simple test-cases of minor industrial relevance. This paper demonstrates the development of a novel deep learning framework for real-time predictions of the impact of manufacturing and build variations on the overall performance of axial compressors in gas turbines, with a focus on tip clearance variations. The associated scatter in efficiency can significantly increase the CO2 emissions, thus being of great industrial and environmental relevance. The proposed C(NN)FD architecture achieves in real-time accuracy comparable to the CFD benchmark. Predicting the flow field and using it to calculate the corresponding overall performance renders the methodology generalisable, while filtering only relevant parts of the CFD solution makes the methodology scalable to industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: Ultracold atoms provide a platform for analog quantum computer capable of simulating the quantum turbulence that underlies puzzling phenomena like pulsar glitches in rapidly spinning neutron stars. Unlike other platforms like liquid helium, ultracold atoms have a viable theoretical framework for dynamics, but simulations push the edge of current classical computers. We present the largest simulations of fermionic quantum turbulence to date and explain the computing technology needed, especially improvements in the ELPA library that enable us to diagonalize matrices of record size (millions by millions). We quantify how dissipation and thermalization proceed in fermionic quantum turbulence by using the internal structure of vortices as a new probe of the local effective temperature. All simulation data and source codes are made available to facilitate rapid scientific progress in the field of ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control for Suppressing Chaotic Response to Dynamic Hydrogen Blending in a Gas Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that periodic forcing of nonlinear flows can result in a chaotic response under certain conditions. Such non-periodic and chaotic solutions have been observed in simulations of heterogeneous gas flow in a pipeline with periodic, time-varying boundary conditions. In this paper, we examine a proportional feedback law for boundary control of a parabolic partial differential equation system that represents the flow of two gases through a pipe. We demonstrate that periodic variation of the mass fraction of the lighter gas at the pipe inlet can result in the chaotic propagation of gas pressure waves, and show that appropriate flow control can suppress this response. We examine phase space solutions for the single pipe system subject to boundary control, and use numerical experiments to characterize conditions for the controller gain to suppress chaos.</description>
