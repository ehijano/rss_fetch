      <title>An AI-powered Knowledge Hub for Potato Functional Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potato functional genomics lags due to unsystematic gene information curation, gene identifier inconsistencies across reference genome versions, and the increasing volume of research publications. To address these limitations, we developed the Potato Knowledge Hub (http://www.potato-ai.top), leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a systematically curated collection of over 3,200 high-quality potato research papers spanning over 120 years. This platform integrates two key modules: a functional gene database containing 2,571 literature-reported genes, meticulously mapped to the latest DMv8.1 reference genome with resolved nomenclature discrepancies and links to original publications; and a potato knowledge base. The knowledge base, built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, accurately answers research queries with literature citations, mitigating LLM "hallucination." Users can interact with the hub via a natural language AI agent, "Potato Research Assistant," for querying specialized knowledge, retrieving gene information, and extracting sequences. The continuously updated Potato Knowledge Hub aims to be a comprehensive resource, fostering advancements in potato functional genomics and supporting breeding programs.</description>

      <title>PathGene: Benchmarking Driver Gene Mutations and Exon Prediction Using Multicenter Lung Cancer Histopathology Image Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

      <title>A DNA Methylation Classification Model Predicts Organ and Disease Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis is a powerful, minimally invasive tool for monitoring disease progression, treatment response, and early detection. A major challenge, however, is accurately determining the tissue of origin, especially in complex or heterogeneous disease contexts. To address this, we developed a machine learning framework that leverages tissue-specific DNA methylation signatures to classify both tissue and disease origin from cfDNA data. Our model integrates methylation datasets across diverse epigenomic platforms, including Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Illumina Infinium Bead Arrays, and Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq). To account for platform variability and data sparsity, we applied imputation strategies and harmonized CpG features to enable cross-platform learning. Dimensionality reduction revealed clear tissue-specific clustering of methylation profiles. A random forest classifier trained on these features achieved consistent classification performance (accuracy 0.75-0.8 across test sets and platforms). Notably, our model distinguished clinically relevant tissues such as inflamed synovium and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in arthritis patients and deconvoluted synthetic cfDNA mixtures mimicking real-world liquid biopsy samples. The predicted tissue proportions closely matched the true values, demonstrating the model's potential for both classification and quantitative inference. These results support the feasibility of using cross-platform methylation data and machine learning for scalable, generalizable cfDNA diagnostics and lay the groundwork for future integration of disease-specific epigenetic features to guide clinical decision-making in precision medicine.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-cost, high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing (HTS) data is the main workforce for the life sciences. Genome sequencing is now becoming a part of Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Participatory (termed 'P4') medicine. All genomic data are currently processed in energy-hungry computer clusters and centers, necessitating data transfer, consuming substantial energy, and wasting valuable time. Therefore, there is a need for fast, energy-efficient, and cost-efficient technologies that enable genomics research without requiring data centers and cloud platforms. We recently started the BioPIM Project to leverage the emerging processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies to enable energy and cost-efficient analysis of bioinformatics workloads. The BioPIM Project focuses on co-designing algorithms and data structures commonly used in genomics with several PIM architectures for the highest cost, energy, and time savings benefit.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Genomic Classification of Alzheimer's Disease: A Transformer-Based Ensemble Approach with Monte Carlo Dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is genetically complex, complicating robust classification from genomic data. METHODS: We developed a transformer-based ensemble model (TrUE-Net) using Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation in AD classification from whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We combined a transformer that preserves single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequence structure with a concurrent random forest using flattened genotypes. An uncertainty threshold separated samples into an uncertain (high-variance) group and a more certain (low-variance) group. RESULTS: We analyzed 1050 individuals, holding out half for testing. Overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.6514 and 0.6636, respectively. Excluding the uncertain group improved accuracy from 0.6263 to 0.7287 (10.24% increase) and F1 from 0.5843 to 0.8205 (23.62% increase). DISCUSSION: Monte Carlo Dropout-driven uncertainty helps identify ambiguous cases that may require further clinical evaluation, thus improving reliability in AD genomic classification.</description>

      <title>DuAL-Net: A Hybrid Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction from Whole-Genome Sequencing via Local SNP Windows and Global Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is the most common form of dementia. With the emergence of disease-modifying therapies, predicting disease risk before symptom onset has become critical. We introduce DuAL-Net, a hybrid deep learning framework for AD dementia prediction using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. DuAL-Net integrates two components: local probability modeling, which segments the genome into non-overlapping windows, and global annotation-based modeling, which annotates SNPs and reorganizes WGS input to capture long-range functional relationships. Both employ out-of-fold stacking with TabNet and Random Forest classifiers. Final predictions combine local and global probabilities using an optimized weighting parameter alpha. We analyzed WGS data from 1,050 individuals (443 cognitively normal, 607 AD dementia) using five-fold cross-validation. DuAL-Net achieved an AUC of 0.671 using top-ranked SNPs, representing 35.0% and 20.3% higher performance than bottom-ranked and randomly selected SNPs, respectively. ROC analysis demonstrated strong positive correlation between SNP prioritization rank and predictive power. The model identified known AD-associated SNPs as top contributors alongside potentially novel variants. DuAL-Net presents a promising framework improving both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. The framework and web implementation offer an accessible platform for broader research applications.</description>

      <title>GenDMR: A dynamic multimodal role-swapping network for identifying risk gene phenotypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that integrating multimodal data fusion techniques for imaging and genetic features is beneficial for the etiological analysis and predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are several critical flaws in current deep learning methods. Firstly, there has been insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally, GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.</description>

      <title>JojoSCL: Shrinkage Contrastive Learning for single-cell RNA sequence Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular processes by enabling gene expression analysis at the individual cell level. Clustering allows for the identification of cell types and the further discovery of intrinsic patterns in single-cell data. However, the high dimensionality and sparsity of scRNA-seq data continue to challenge existing clustering models. In this paper, we introduce JojoSCL, a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework for scRNA-seq clustering. By incorporating a shrinkage estimator based on hierarchical Bayesian estimation, which adjusts gene expression estimates towards more reliable cluster centroids to reduce intra-cluster dispersion, and optimized using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE), JojoSCL refines both instance-level and cluster-level contrastive learning. Experiments on ten scRNA-seq datasets substantiate that JojoSCL consistently outperforms prevalent clustering methods, with further validation of its practicality through robustness analysis and ablation studies. JojoSCL's code is available at: https://github.com/ziwenwang28/JojoSCL.</description>

      <title>SPAC: A Python Package for Spatial Single-Cell Analysis of Multiplex Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy captures detailed measurements of spatially resolved, multiple biomarkers simultaneously, revealing tissue composition and cellular interactions in situ among single cells. The growing scale and dimensional complexity of these datasets demand reproducible, comprehensive and user-friendly computational tools. To address this need, we developed SPAC (SPAtial single-Cell analysis), a Python-based package and a corresponding shiny application within an integrated, modular SPAC ecosystem (Liu et al., 2025) designed specifically for biologists without extensive coding expertise. Following image segmentation and extraction of spatially resolved single-cell data, SPAC streamlines downstream phenotyping and spatial analysis, facilitating characterization of cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization within tissues. Through scalable performance, specialized spatial statistics, highly customizable visualizations, and seamless workflows from dataset to insights, SPAC significantly lowers barriers to sophisticated spatial analyses.</description>

      <title>The optimization of crop response to climatic stress through modulation of plant stress response mechanisms. Opportunities for biostimulants and plant hormones to meet climate challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.</description>

      <title>SPACE: Your Genomic Profile Predictor is a Powerful DNA Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the success of unsupervised pre-training paradigms, researchers have applied these approaches to DNA pre-training. However, we argue that these approaches alone yield suboptimal results because pure DNA sequences lack sufficient information, since their functions are regulated by genomic profiles like chromatin accessibility. Here, we demonstrate that supervised training for genomic profile prediction serves as a more effective alternative to pure sequence pre-training. Furthermore, considering the multi-species and multi-profile nature of genomic profile prediction, we introduce our $\textbf{S}$pecies-$\textbf{P}$rofile $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{E}$xperts (SPACE) that leverages Mixture of Experts (MoE) to better capture the relationships between DNA sequences across different species and genomic profiles, thereby learning more effective DNA representations. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing that DNA models trained with supervised genomic profiles serve as powerful DNA representation learners.
