      <title>Accretion-disk reflection in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 as viewed by Chandra grating spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active galactic nuclei, X-ray illumination of the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the production of the K$\alpha$ fluorescent line of iron, which provides insights into accretion physics and SMBH spins. In this work, we studied X-ray reflection from the accretion disk in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 using all the data collected by the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer. We used hardness-ratio diagrams to distinguish between different spectral states and conducted spectral analysis of all the multi-epoch datasets, as well as the source in the observed spectral states. Our hardness analysis indicates that the source gradually evolved into a harder state (2013-2016) compared to the previous epochs (2000-2001). Our spectral modeling implies that the relativistically broadened iron emission from the innermost accretion disk is associated with a near-maximal SMBH spin ($a=0.98^{+0.02}_{-0.12}$) in all the datasets, even though the hard state was present in 17% of them, and a consistent spin is also found in different spectral states. In addition, the narrow, bright Fe K$\alpha$ line from distant regions has an excess velocity of $620^{+80}_{-70}$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the rest frame, implying that some distant layers of the disk could be twisted. Our results suggest that, despite long-term changes in the X-ray brightness of NGC 3783, likely caused by eclipsing material, the relativistic reflection can be constrained thanks to the substantial counts provided by multi-epoch observations, while a warped disk structure may be present.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05265v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiation-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright UV flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from Carbon-Burning Red Supergiants and Their Detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars emit MeV neutrinos during their evolution via nuclear syntheses and thermal processes, and detecting them could provide insights into stellar structure beyond what is accessible through electromagnetic wave observations. So far, MeV neutrinos have been observed from the Sun and SN 1987A. It has been suggested that pre-supernova stars in the oxygen and silicon burning stages would emit enough MeV neutrinos to be detectable on Earth, provided they are in the local universe. In this study, we investigate the prospect of detecting neutrinos from red supergiants (RSGs) in the carbon-burning phase. In our Galaxy, around a thousand RSGs have been cataloged, and several are expected to be in the carbon-burning phase. We first calculate the luminosity and energy spectrum of neutrinos emitted during the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars. For a nearby carbon-burning RSG located $\sim200$ pc away, we estimate the neutrino flux reaching Earth to be as large as $\sim10^5$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ with a spectrum peaking $\sim0.6$ MeV. We then assess the feasibility of detecting these neutrinos in underground facilities, particularly in hybrid detectors equipped with water-based liquid scintillator and ultra-fast photodetectors. In detectors with a volume comparable to Super-Kamiokande, for the above flux, we anticipate up to $\sim50$ neutrino events per year with directional information. Although this is a fair number, the number of events from radioactive backgrounds would be much larger. Our results indicate that studying neutrinos from carbon-burning RSGs and predicting supernovae well in advance before their explosion would be challenging with currently available detector technologies.</description>

      <title>The Equation of State of Neutron Stars: Theoretical Models, Observational Constraints, and Future Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a fundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase transition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark core, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational and theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger astrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER and spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS modifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>Prediction of lithium isotope fluxes using data-driven production cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) generally share common propagation features, leading to consistent spectral observations of secondary nuclei such as Li, Be, and B. However, the Li spectrum predicted by the CR diffusion coefficient inferred from B/C is significantly lower than the latest measurement of AMS-02. This anomaly may be attributed to the missing contributions from the heavy nuclei components in cosmic rays. By including these missing contributions the excess of the Li spectrum disappears. However, another inconsistency still exists since the calculated Li spectrum is now overestimated compared to the data. In this work, we update the cross-section model used to calculate the Li production according to more cross-section measurements. We find that the cross sections of these added reactions are systematically overestimated, and should be renormalized to the interpolations of available data. As a result, our prediction of the total Li spectrum is consistent with the measurement without discrepancy, and our prediction of the $\rm^6Li$ and $\rm^7Li$ spectra are consistent with the preliminary measurements of AMS-02 within the cross-section uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Exploring the disc-jet scenario in 3C 273 using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: 3C 273, a well-studied active galactic nucleus (AGN), displays characteristics of both jetted-AGN and Seyfert galaxies, making it an excellent source to study the disc-jet connection in AGN. Aims: To investigate the disk-jet scenario in 3C 273 using broadband (0.3--78 keV) X-ray spectra from {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR}. Methods: We used simultaneous {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} observations of 3C 273 carried out between 2012 and 2024. The 0.3--78 keV X-ray spectra were first fit with a simple power-law (PL) and then with the accretion-ejection-based JeTCAF model. The JeTCAF model accounts for emission from the jet, extending up to the sonic surface. In this framework, a reflection hump above 10 keV can also arise due to the bulk motion Comptonization of coronal photons by the jet. Results: We found that the simple PL did not provide a good fit, leaving significant residuals at energies below 1.5 keV. All the spectra were fitted well by the JeTCAF model. The weighted-averaged black hole mass of (7.77$\pm$0.30) $\times 10^8 M_\odot$ obtained from the JeTCAF model is comparable with the previous estimates based on reverberation mapping observations and accretion disk models. Conclusions: The 0.3--78 keV X-ray emission of 3C 273 can be fit by the accretion-ejection-based model in which the corona and the jet on top of it make significant contributions to the X-ray flux. The Doppler boosting factor estimated from the jet flux ranges from 1.6 to 2.2, consistent with the lower limit from the literature.</description>

      <title>The dispersion measure and scattering of Fast Radio Bursts: contributions from multi-components, and clues for the intrinsic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, millisecond-duration transients that offer great potential for probing the universe, yet their physical origins remain unclear. The dispersion measure (DM) and scattering time ($\tau$) distributions provide key insights into FRBs' properties, including source population, redshift, and energy distribution. We use a simplified model of FRB source population and intrinsic Schechter function-like energy distribution, coupled with a thorough assessment of various contributors to dispersion and scattering, to replicate the joint distribution of DM and $\tau$ in the CHIME/FRB catalog. A mixed FRB source population, including both young and old progenitors, is considered. Contributions to the DM and $\tau$ from interstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM) within host and foreground halos are informed by the IllustrisTNG simulation, while contributions from the Milky Way, intergalactic medium (IGM), and local environmental are estimated by updated models. Using MCMC simulations, we identify optimal model that well reproduce the DM distribution and broadly reproduce the $\tau$ distribution in the CHIME/FRB catalog. Our model suggests that the fraction of FRBs tracing star-formation rate is $\rm{f_{PSFR}=0.58^{+0.16}_{-0.27}}$, while $\rm{log_{10}E_*[erg]=42.27^{+1.17}_{-1.18}}$ and $\gamma=-1.60^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ in the energy distribution function. Scattering predominantly arises from the circumburst medium or the ISM and CGM of hosts, which cause a DM of $\sim 10\, \rm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$. Using our optimal model, we estimate FRB redshifts with two methods: DM-only and combined DM-$\tau$. Evaluation with 68 localized FRBs reveals an RMS error $0.11-0.12$, and incorporation of $\tau$ has a minor effect. We further argue that the host galaxy properties of localized FRBs could be a potential tool to validate our model in the future.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory from Accelerating Relativistic Jets in Multiple Thick Shell Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) memory, a permanent distortion of the space-time metric, is anticipated during the acceleration of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). While the precise mechanism behind GRBs is not yet fully understood, detecting GW memory may contribute to clarifying their nature. In this paper, we consider various scenarios of GW memory emission, including both single and multiple shells with thin- and thick-shells. In particular, the memory spectrum for each scenario is compared with the sensitivity of next-generation detectors, namely DECIGO and ET-D. Physical properties spread over a broad-band region, emphasizing the importance of combined and wide-band observations. We also simulate GW memory based on nearby, realistic scenarios and demonstrate its detectability.</description>

      <title>Impact of mass transfer on the orbital evolution of a white dwarf close to an intermediate-mass black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems composed of low-mass white dwarfs (WDs, $0.1 - 0.3$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot } $) and intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $10^{3} - 10^{5}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot } $) are ideal objects for multi-messenger astronomy because they produce both gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals. Both relativistic effects and the mass transfer (MT) process are important for determining orbital dynamics, but the current model has not taken these ingredients fully into account. Here we use a perturbed Keplerian framework and the post-Newtonian (PN) formalism to model the relativistic orbit of a WD around a spinning IMBH. We pay special attention to the dynamical evolution during a narrow phase near the orbital pericenter where the WD fills the Roche lobe and starts MT. We find that gravitational radiation and MT have opposing effects on orbital evolution. When MT predominates, the orbital period and eccentricity could may increase, sometimes enabling the WD to escape and avoid tidal disruption. Additionally, we estimate the time required for the GW phase to shift by one radian due to the MT process and identify cases where this phase shift will be detectable by future GW observations. The temporal expansion of the orbit during MT offers a potential explanation for the disappearance of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) found in several X-ray transients, highlighting the importance of including both the relativistic and MT processes in the WD-IMBH model.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from Inspiral through Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research.
  First, we have developed a novel 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through the emission of photons.
  Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ${\sim\!200}$ orbits starting from a separation of ${20\,r_g}$ and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have identified how and when the minidisks dissolve as the binary compresses. We also show that even when the binary ``decouples'' from its surrounding disk, its luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few and abruptly increases by ${\sim\!50\%}$ at the time of merger, accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, the magnetic flux brought to the spin-parameter ${\sim\!0.68}$ merger remnant is able to drive a relativistic, Poynting-flux-dominated jet.</description>

      <title>On the distance to the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the existing distance estimates to the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 with a discussion of the accuracies and caveats of the associated methodologies. As part of this, we present new line-of-sight HI absorption spectra captured using the MeerKAT radio telescope. We estimate a maximum radial velocity with respect to the local standard of rest of $24.8 \pm 2.8$ km s$^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than that found towards an extragalactic reference source. Given the location of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 at Galactic longitude and latitude $(l, b) \approx (8.6\deg, 10.3\deg)$, we explore the feasibility of the HI absorption method. From this we derive a near kinematic distance of $d_{\rm{near}} = 3.6 \pm 0.3\ (stat) \pm 2.3\ (sys)$ kpc as lower bound for the distance to Swift J1727.8$-$1613. We compare our results with those derived from different distance determination methods including the use of colour excess or reddening along the line of sight, which we constrain to $E(B-V) = 0.37 \pm 0.01\ (stat) \pm 0.025\ (sys)$ using near-UV spectra. By combining this with donor star magnitudes reported by Mata S\'anchez et al. (2024b), we suggest an increased distance of $5.5^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ kpc, which would imply a natal kick velocity of $190 \pm 30$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>MAD accretion and AGN jets - an observational perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major open questions related to the production of jets by accreting black holes is: why do sources with similar accretion powers produce so vastly different jet powers? What conditions are required to make a powerful jet? If jets are powered by the Blandford-Zjanek mechanism, two further parameters control the jet power besides the black hole mass - black hole spin and the magnetic flux threading it. Since highly spinning black holes without jets appear to exist, the jet production efficiency may depend on whether the black hole managed to accrete high enough magnetic flux in the past. The highest-efficiency jets in this picture are launched from magnetically arrested disks (MADs). Here we discuss a method to test this hypothesis using VLBI core-shift measurements to estimate the jet magnetic flux.</description>

      <title>Cosmic electron spectra by the Voyager instruments and the Galactic electrostatic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Voyager spacecrafts have been measuring since 2012 the rates of electron and nuclei of the cosmic radiation beyond the solar cavity at a distance of more than $10^{13}$ $meters$ from the Earth. A record of unique and notable findings have been reported and, among them, the electron-to-proton flux ratio of 50 to 100 below energies of $50$ $MeV$. This ratio is thoroughly opposite of that of 0.01 measured at higher energies in the range 10 $GeV$ to 10 $TeV$. The difference amounts to four orders of magnitude. Arguments and calculations to show how this surprising and fundamental ratio lends support to the empirical evidence of the ubiquitous electrostatic field in the Milky Way Galaxy are presented. In other respects this paper examines and calculates, for the first time, the electric charge balance in the solar system delimited by the $termination$ $shock$ of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Study of the 2024 major Vela glitch at the Argentine Institute of Radioastronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here on new results of the systematic monitoring of southern glitching pulsars at the Argentine Institute of Radioastronomy. In particular, we study in this work the new major glitch in the Vela pulsar (PSR J0835$-$4510) that occurred on 2024 April 29. We aim to thoroughly characterise the rotational behaviour of the Vela pulsar around its last major glitch and investigate the statistical properties of its individual pulses around the glitch. We characterise the rotational behaviour of the pulsar around the glitch through the pulsar timing technique. We measured the glitch parameters by fitting timing residuals to the data collected during the days surrounding the event. In addition, we study Vela individual pulses during the days of observation just before and after the glitch. We selected nine days of observations around the major glitch on 2024 April 29 and studied their statistical properties with the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) technique. We used Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) reconstruction of the pulses to separate them clearly from the noise. We obtain a precise timing solution for the glitch. We find two recovery terms of $\sim 3~\mathrm{days}$ and $\sim 17~\mathrm{days}$. We find a correlation of high amplitude with narrower pulses while not finding notable qualitative systematic changes before and after the glitch.</description>

      <title>Neutrino spin oscillations near a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study neutrino spin oscillations in the case when they are gravitationally scattered off a rotating Kerr black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. We consider only toroidal magnetic field inside the disk. Neutrino spin precession is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. Our treatment of the spin oscillations of the observed neutrino fluxes is based on numerical simulations of the propagation of a large number of incoming test neutrinos using High Performance Parallel Computing. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Zooming In On The Multi-Phase Structure of Magnetically-Dominated Quasar Disks: Radiation From Torus to ISCO Across Accretion Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent radiation-thermochemical-magnetohydrodynamic simulations resolved formation of quasar accretion disks from cosmological scales down to ~300 gravitational radii $R_{g}$, arguing they were 'hyper-magnetized' (plasma $\beta\ll1$ supported by toroidal magnetic fields) and distinct from traditional $\alpha$-disks. We extend these, refining to $\approx 3\,R_{g}$ around a $10^{7}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ BH with multi-channel radiation and thermochemistry, and exploring a factor of 1000 range of accretion rates ($\dot{m}\sim0.01-20$). At smaller scales, we see the disks maintain steady accretion, thermalize and self-ionize, and radiation pressure grows in importance, but large deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and single-phase equations of state are always present. Trans-Alfvenic and highly-supersonic turbulence persists in all cases, and leads to efficient vertical mixing, so radiation pressure saturates at levels comparable to fluctuating magnetic and turbulent pressures even for $\dot{m}\gg1$. The disks also become radiatively inefficient in the inner regions at high $\dot{m}$. The midplane magnetic field remains primarily toroidal at large radii, but at super-Eddington $\dot{m}$ we see occasional transitions to a poloidal-field dominated state associated with outflows and flares. Large-scale magnetocentrifugal and continuum radiation-pressure-driven outflows are weak at $\dot{m}&lt;1$, but can be strong at $\dot{m}\gtrsim1$. In all cases there is a scattering photosphere above the disk extending to $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{g}$ at large $\dot{m}$, and the disk is thick and flared owing to magnetic support (with $H/R$ nearly independent of $\dot{m}$), so the outer disk is strongly illuminated by the inner disk and most of the inner disk continuum scatters or is reprocessed at larger scales, giving apparent emission region sizes as large as $\gtrsim 10^{16}\,{\rm cm}$.</description>

      <title>Is PSR J0514$-$4002E in a PBH-NS binary?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing observations using MeerKAT of the eccentric binary millisecond pulsar, PSR J0514$-$4002E, have unveiled a companion with a mass in the mass gap, ranging from $2.09\, M_\odot$ to $2.71\, M_\odot$. This challenges conventional astrophysical scenarios for black hole formation. In this paper, we present an alternative explanation: PSR J0514$-$4002E could be in a PBH-NS binary, with the companion potentially being a primordial black hole formed during the early Universe's first-order phase transition. The associated stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during this phase transition can account for the observed signal from the pulsar timing array, and the abundance of primordial black holes is consistent with constraints from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <title>The vela supernova remnant: The unique morphological features of jittering jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify an S-shaped main-jet axis in the Vela core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) that we attribute to a pair of precessing jets, one of the tens of pairs of jets that exploded the progenitor of Vela according to the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). A main-jet axis is a symmetry axis across the CCSNR and through the center. We identify the S-shaped main-jet axis by the high abundance of ejecta elements, oxygen, neon, and magnesium. We bring the number of identified pairs of clumps and ears in Vela to seven, two pairs shaped by the pair of precessing jets that formed the main-jet axis. The pairs and the main-jet axis form the point-symmetric wind-rose structure of Vela. The other five pairs of clumps/ears do not have signatures near the center, only on two opposite sides of the CCSNR. We discuss different possible jet-less shaping mechanisms to form such a point-symmetric morphology and dismiss these processes because they cannot explain the point-symmetric morphology of Vela, the S-shaped high ejecta abundance pattern, and the enormous energy to shape the S-shaped structure. Our findings strongly support the JJEM and further severely challenge the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.</description>

      <title>Formation of twin compact stars in low-mass X-ray binaries: Implications on eccentric and isolated millisecond pulsar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are laboratories for stellar evolution, strong gravity, and ultra-dense matter. Although MSPs are thought to originate in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), approximately 27% lack a binary companion, and others are found in systems with large orbital eccentricities. Understanding how these systems form may provide insight into the internal properties of neutron stars (NSs).
  We studied the formation of a twin compact star through rapid first-order phase transitions in NS cores due to mass accretion in LMXBs. We investigated whether this mechanism, possibly coupled with secondary kick effects such as neutrino or electromagnetic rocket effects, leaves an observable long-lasting imprint on the orbit.
  We simulated mass accretion in LMXBs consisting of a NS and a low-mass main-sequence companion and followed the evolution of the NS mass, radius, and spin until a strong phase transition is triggered. For the NS structure, we assumed a multi-polytrope equation of state that allows for a sharp phase transition from hadronic to quark matter and satisfies observational constraints.
  We find that in compact binaries with relatively short pre-Roche lobe overflow orbital periods, an accretion-induced phase transition can occur during the LMXB phase. In contrast, in systems with wider orbits, this transition can take place during the spin-down phase, forming an eccentric binary MSP. If the transition is accompanied by a secondary kick, then the binary is likely to be disrupted, forming an isolated MSP or re-configured into an ultra-wide orbit.
  Our findings suggest that accretion in LMXBs provides a viable path for forming twin compact stars, potentially leaving an observable imprint on the orbit. The eccentricity distribution of binary MSPs with long orbital periods (&gt; 50 d) could provide constraints on first-order phase transitions in dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Parsec-scale jet direction evolution in AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the variability of the parsec-scale jet directions in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our analysis involves 317 AGNs at frequencies ranging from 2 to 43 GHz, and is made possible by developing an automatic inner jet direction measurement procedure. We find strong significant variations in a one quarter of these AGNs; the effect is likely ubiquitous, and not detected in the rest due to a limited sensitivity and observations epoch coverage. Average apparent jet rotation speeds range from 0.21 deg/yr at 2 GHz to 1.04 deg/yr at 43 GHz. This strong frequency dependence indicates that the variability cannot be explained by jet components propagating ballistically without acceleration: more complex jet shapes or patterns are required. Still, we demonstrate that the apparent direction changes are predominantly caused by the jet nozzle rotations, and not by individual components propagating transversely to the jet. In this work, we focus on variability scales much longer than the times of observations, that is &gt; 50 years. Using our measurements, we bound potential periods to less than 1000 years in the source rest frame for 90% AGNs in the sample. This allows us to constrain mechanisms causing these variations if they are periodic, such as instabilities, disk-driven precession, or binary black hole effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical component of particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks is the non-resonant (Bell) instability, where the streaming of cosmic rays (CRs) leads to the amplification of magnetic fields necessary to scatter particles. In this work we use kinetic particle-in-cells simulations to investigate the high-CR current regime, where the typical assumptions underlying the Bell instability break down. Despite being more strongly driven, significantly less magnetic field amplification is observed compared to low-current cases, an effect due to the anisotropic heating that occurs in this regime. We also find that electron-scale modes, despite being fastest growing, mostly lead to moderate electron heating and do not affect the late evolution or saturation of the instability.</description>

      <title>Maximal Jet Energy of Gamma-Ray Bursts through the Blandford-Znajek Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, driven by relativistic jets launched from black holes (BHs) formed during the collapse of massive stars or after the merger of two neutron stars (NSs). The jet power depends on the BH spin and the magnetic flux accreted onto it. In the standard thin disk model, jet power is limited by insufficient magnetic flux, even when the spin approaches maximum possible value. In contrast, the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state limits jet energy by extracting significant angular momentum, braking BH rotation. We propose a unified model incorporating both standard thin disk and MAD states, identifying a universal curve for jet power per accretion rate as a function of the magnetic flux ratio, $\Delta_\mathrm{eq} = (\Phi_\mathrm{BH}/\Phi_\mathrm{MAD})_\mathrm{eq}$, at spin equilibrium. For long GRBs (lGRBs), the model predicts a maximum jet energy of $\sim 1.5\%$ of the accretion energy, occurring at $\Delta_\mathrm{eq} \sim 0.4$ where the BH equilibrium spin is $a \sim 0.5$. Both long and short GRBs are unlikely to be produced by a MAD: for short GRBs (sGRBs), this requires an accreted mass orders of magnitude smaller than that available, while for lGRBs, the narrow progenitor mass distribution challenges the ability to produce the observed broad distribution of jet energies. This framework provides a consistent explanation for both standard and luminous GRBs, emphasizing the critical role of magnetic flux. Both long and short GRBs require magnetic flux distributions that peak around $10^{27}\,\mathrm{G\,cm}^2$.</description>

Abstract: We present a timing study of the gamma and X-ray observations and analysis of a sample of bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; i.e. GRB 180720B, GRB 181222B, GRB 211211A and GRB 220910A), including the very bright and long GRB 211211A (a.k.a. kilonova candidate). They have been detected and observed by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on-board the Fermi mission. The early (T-T0=s) and high-energy (0.3-20 MeV) ASIM High Energy Detector (HED) and (150 keV-30 MeV) Fermi (BGO) light curves show well-defined peaks with a low quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency between 2.5-3.5 Hz that could be identified with the spin of the neutron star in the binary mergers (coinciding with the orbital frequency of the binary merger) originating these GRBs. These QPOs consist on the first detection of low-frequency QPOs (&lt;10 Hz) detected in magnetars so far. We also detect a strong QPO at 21.8-22 Hz in GRB 181222B together with its (less significant) harmonics. The low-frequency QPO would correspond to the signal of the orbiting neutron star (NS) previous to the final coalescence giving rise to the gravitational-wave (GW) signal.</description>

      <title>Impact of Sub-MeV Dark Matter on the Cooling of Pulsating White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our galaxy, white dwarfs inevitably undergo scattering and capture processes with the interstellar diffuse dark matter. The captured dark matter forms a dark halo that eventually evaporates or annihilates. Theoretical pulsation modes and observations of pulsating white dwarfs provide predictions about their evolution. This motivates us to study the impact of sub-MeV interstellar dark matter on the cooling processes of white dwarfs. In this work, we consider the collisions between dark matter and relativistic degenerate electrons inside white dwarfs, numerically calculating the energy input and output results from scattering, capture, evaporation, and annihilation processes. Based on observational data from G117-B15, we conclude that the maximum cooling luminosity of the interstellar sub-MeV dark matter is approximately $10^{22} \, \text{erg}/\text{s}$, which is insufficient to provide an effective cooling mechanism for white dwarfs. Finally, if future observations detect a pulsating white dwarf in the Galactic center, the potential sensitivity of this scenario could extend to the region$10^{-3}\,\text{MeV} &lt; m_\chi &lt; 10 \, \text{MeV}$ and $6.02 \times 10^{-38}\,\text{cm}^2 &gt; \sigma_0 \geq 1.5 \times 10^{40} \, \text{cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Gamma-ray Burst Phenomenology on the Hypothesis of Quark Star as the central engine of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a strange quark star (QS) predicted in the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis has been a matter of debate. The combustion from a neutron star to a strange QS in its accreted process in a low-mass X-ray binary is proposed to be a scenario that generates gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); the baryon contamination of the outflow is very low and mainly from the masses of crusts ($M_{\rm crust}$) of QSs. A special subset of GRBs detected in the past 16 years are collected and used to estimate $M_{\rm crust}$ under this assumption of QSs as central engines. Correspondingly, $M_{\rm crust}$ is calculated in the frameworks of several models for cold dense quark matter (MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with or without the impacts from the formation of color superconducting condensates being considered), for comparison with the observation. In conclusion, we find that the GRB samples have so far failed to provide positive support for this hypothesis, and the NJL model in which the existence of hybrid stars is allowed might be more consistent with the observation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Planes of Black Hole Activity for Strong Jet Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources originate from disk+coronas or jets is still controversial. In this work, we constructed a strong jet sample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects to explore the origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud active galactic nucleus with a powerful jet toward the observer, causing their broadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect, we obtain the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation and the fundamental plane (FP) of black hole activity for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation is $L_{\rm{R,int}}\propto L_{\rm{X,int}}^{1.04}$, which favor the jet-dominated mode, the intrinsic FP is $\log L_{\rm{R,int}}=(1.07\pm0.06)\log L_{\rm{X,int}}-(0.22\pm0.10)\log M_{\rm{BH}}-(3.77\pm2.11)$, which can be interpreted by the hybrid mode of jet+standard disk. Our results suggest that the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources are dominated by the jets, but there may also be a small contribution from the disk. In addition, the radio--X-ray correlation and FP of strong jet sources do not have a significant dependence on the Eddington-ratio.</description>

      <title>Charged Quark Stars and Extreme Compact Objects in Regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\rightarrow 4$ limit for 4 dimensional Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations modified for charge and 4DEGB gravity, we model the stellar structure of charged, non-interacting quark stars. We find that increasing the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ or the charge $Q$ both tend to increase the mass-radius profiles of quark stars described by this theory, allowing a given central pressure to support larger quark stars in general. We also derive a generalization of the Buchdahl bound for charged stars in 4DEGB gravity. As in the uncharged case, we find that quark stars can exist below the general relativistic Buchdahl bound (BB) and Schwarzschild radius $R=2M$, due to the lack of a mass gap between black holes and compact stars in the 4DEGB theory. Even for $\alpha$ well within current observational constraints, we find that quark star solutions in this theory can describe Extreme Compact Charged Objects (ECCOs), objects whose radii are smaller than what is allowed by general relativity.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction through magnetic reconnection from a Kerr-Newman black hole in perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, a novel mechanism recently proposed by Comisso and Asenjo, for a Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Our studies focus on the impact of black hole spin $a$, electric charge $Q$ and PFDM parameter $\lambda$ on the horizons, ergoregion and circular geodesics at the equatorial plane of this black hole, and how they further influence the reconnection efficiency and energy extraction rate. Our results show that the outer horizon and the size of ergoregion do not vary monotonically with increasing dark matter parameters $\lambda$ until reaching its critical value $\lambda_c$ due to the combined counteracting effect between the black hole's charge and dark matter parameter. We identify the optimal combinations of $a$, $Q$ and $\lambda$ that allow for efficient energy extraction and high extracted power, even when the black hole is not spinning near its extremal limit. Our results ease the stringent conditions observed in other rotating black holes, where achieving comparable levels of extracted power and reconnection efficiency typically requires a near-extremal spin.</description>

      <title>Effects of orbital eccentricity on continuous gravitational waveforms from triaxially deformed precessing neutron stars in tight binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The successful detection of continuous gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars (NSs) will shape our understanding of the physical properties of dense matter under extreme conditions. Binary population synthesis simulations show that forthcoming space-borne gravitational wave detectors may be capable of detecting some tight Galactic double NSs with 10-min orbital periods. Successfully searching for continuous waves from the individual NS in such a close binary demands extremely precise waveform templates considering the interaction between the NS and its companion. Unlike the isolated formation channel, double NS systems from the dynamical formation channel have moderate to high orbital eccentricities. To accommodate these systems, we generalize the analytical waveforms from triaxial nonaligned NSs under spin-orbit coupling derived by Feng \textit{et al.} [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063035}{Phys. Rev. D 108, 063035 (2023)}] to incorporate the effects of the orbital eccentricity. Our findings suggest that for binaries formed through isolated binary evolution, the impact of eccentricity on the continuous waves of their NSs can be neglected. In contrast, for those formed through dynamical processes, it is necessary to consider eccentricity, as high-eccentricity orbits can result in a fitting factor of $\lesssim 0.97$ (0.9) within approximately 0.5 (1) to 2 (5) yr of a coherent search (at wave frequencies of 100 and 200 Hz). Once the continuous waves from spinning NSs in tight binaries are detected, the relative measurement accuracy of eccentricity can reach $\Delta e / e \sim O(10^{-7})$ for a signal-to-noise ratio of $O(100)$ based on the Fisher information matrix, bearing significant implications for understanding the formation mechanisms of double NS systems.</description>

      <title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes "dangerous". We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as "red nugget relics", as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples).</description>

      <title>Generation of cosmic ray trajectories by a Diffusion Model trained on test particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for the transport of high energy charged particles through strong magnetic turbulence play a key role in space and astrophysical studies, such as describing the propagation of solar energetic particles and high energy cosmic rays. Inspired by the recent advances in high-performance machine learning techniques, we investigate the application of generative diffusion models to synthesizing test particle trajectories obtained from a turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We consider velocity increment, spatial transport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the baseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider two synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an application-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>BASS XLVII: 22 GHz Radio Atlas of Swift-BAT Selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected AGN, with a very high $98 \pm 1\%$ detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1" spatial resolution covering over $6$ orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGN that span $\sim4$ orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: $44 \pm 3\%$ (102/231) are compact or unresolved, $46 \pm 3\%$ (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and $8 \pm 2\%$ (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining $2 \pm 1\%$ (4/231) sources are non-detections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGN ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{14-195 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5.5}$ and $\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{2-10 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5}$) with a scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex are similar to that of coronally active stars ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_X \sim 10^{-5}$). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous FIR observations, once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGN at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation VLA (ngVLA) or Square Kilometre Array (SKA), both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGN.</description>
