      <title>Quantum Key Distribution by Quantum Energy Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is a process that leverages quantum entanglement and local operations to transfer energy between two spatially separated locations without physically transporting particles or energy carriers. We construct a QET-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol and analyze its security and robustness to noise in both the classical and the quantum channels. We generalize the construction to an $N$-party information sharing protocol, possessing a feature that dishonest participants can be detected.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Interpretability of Quantum-Assisted Blockchain Clustering via AI Agent-Based Qualitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain transaction data is inherently high dimensional, noisy, and entangled, posing substantial challenges for traditional clustering algorithms. While quantum enhanced clustering models have demonstrated promising performance gains, their interpretability remains limited, restricting their application in sensitive domains such as financial fraud detection and blockchain governance. To address this gap, we propose a two stage analysis framework that synergistically combines quantitative clustering evaluation with AI Agent assisted qualitative interpretation. In the first stage, we employ classical clustering methods and evaluation metrics including the Silhouette Score, Davies Bouldin Index, and Calinski Harabasz Index to determine the optimal cluster count and baseline partition quality. In the second stage, we integrate an AI Agent to generate human readable, semantic explanations of clustering results, identifying intra cluster characteristics and inter cluster relationships. Our experiments reveal that while fully trained Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) outperform random Quantum Features (QF) in quantitative metrics, the AI Agent further uncovers nuanced differences between these methods, notably exposing the singleton cluster phenomenon in QNN driven models. The consolidated insights from both stages consistently endorse the three cluster configuration, demonstrating the practical value of our hybrid approach. This work advances the interpretability frontier in quantum assisted blockchain analytics and lays the groundwork for future autonomous AI orchestrated clustering frameworks.</description>

      <title>2D Entanglement from a Single Motzkin Spaghetto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their 2D counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least 4 neighboring degrees of freedom. In this letter, a 2D lattice system interacting only between two nearest neighboring sites is proposed, which has a unique ground state with volume scaling of entanglement entropy. The system undergoes an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous construction from coupling orthogonal arrays of one-dimensional chains, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. A tensor network representation is composed of tensors with lower rank, and has a similar global geometry.</description>

      <title>Learning Circuits with Infinite Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation on quantum computers is strongly constrained by gate counts, motivating techniques to reduce circuit depths. While tensor networks are natural competitors to quantum computers, we instead leverage them to support circuit design, with datasets of tensor networks enabling a unitary synthesis inspired by quantum machine learning. For a target simulation in the thermodynamic limit, translation invariance is exploited to significantly reduce the optimization complexity, avoiding a scaling with system size. Our approach finds circuits to efficiently prepare ground states, and perform time evolution on both infinite and finite systems with substantially lower gate depths than conventional Trotterized methods. In addition to reducing CNOT depths, we motivate similar utility for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, with a demonstrated $5.2\times$ reduction in $T$-count to realize $e^{-iHt}$. The key output of our approach is the optimized unit-cell of a translation invariant circuit. This provides an advantage for Hamiltonian simulation of finite, yet arbitrarily large, systems on real quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Vacuum in Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intriguing consequence of quantum field theory is that vacuum is not empty space; it is full of quantum fluctuating electromagnetic fields, or virtual photons, corresponding to their zero-point energy, even though the average number of photons is zero. These short-lived vacuum fluctuations are behind some of the most fascinating physical processes in the universe, including spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, and the Casimir force. Recent theory and experiments indicate that the properties of materials placed in photonic cavities may be altered, even in the complete absence of any external fields, through interaction with the fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic fields. Judicious engineering of the quantum vacuum surrounding the matter inside a cavity can lead to significant and nonintuitive modifications of electronic and vibrational states, producing a ``vacuum dressed'' material. These exciting new ideas have stimulated discussions regarding the fundamental physics of vacuum-matter interactions and also broadened the scope of potential applications using zero-point fluctuations to engineer materials. This Perspective will first discuss recent experimental and theoretical developments on vacuum-modified condensed matter systems, which usually require the realization of the so-called ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime. Then, we will overview some of the most promising cavity designs for enhancing vacuum electromagnetic fields in materials with various energy scales. Finally, we will discuss urgent open questions and technical challenges to be solved in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating magnetic field robustness and reducing temporal T1 noise in transmon qubits through magnetic field engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence of superconducting transmon qubits is often disrupted by fluctuations in the energy relaxation time (T1), limiting their performance for quantum computing. While background magnetic fields can be harmful to superconducting devices, we demonstrate that both trapped magnetic flux and externally applied static magnetic fields can suppress temporal fluctuations in T1 without significantly degrading its average value or qubit frequency. Using a three-axis Helmholtz coil system, we applied calibrated magnetic fields perpendicular to the qubit plane during cooldown and operation. Remarkably, transmon qubits based on tantalum-capped niobium (Nb/Ta) capacitive pads and aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs) maintained T1 lifetimes near 300 {\mu}s even when cooled in fields as high as 600 mG. Both trapped flux up to 600 mG and applied fields up to 400 mG reduced T1 fluctuations by more than a factor of two, while higher field strengths caused rapid coherence degradation. We attribute this stabilization to the polarization of paramagnetic impurities, the role of trapped flux as a sink for non-equilibrium quasiparticles (QPs), and partial saturation of fluctuating two-level systems (TLSs). These findings challenge the conventional view that magnetic fields are inherently detrimental and introduce a strategy for mitigating noise in superconducting qubits, offering a practical path toward more stable and scalable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Prepare-and-Magic: Semi-Device Independent Magic Certification in the Prepare-and-Measure Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is an essential resource for quantum computational advantage, as stabilizer states admit efficient classical simulation. We develop a semi-device-independent framework for certifying non-stabilizer states in prepare-and-measure (PAM) scenarios, relying only on assumptions about the system's dimension. Within this framework, we introduce dimensional witnesses that can distinguish stabilizer from non-stabilizer states, and we provide analytical proofs that threshold violations of these witnesses certify non-stabilizerness. In the simplest setting-three preparations, two measurements, and qubit systems-surpassing a specific threshold guarantees that at least one prepared state lies outside the stabilizer polytope. We extend this approach by linking it to quantum random access codes, also generalizing our results to qutrit systems and introducing a necessary condition for certifying non-stabilizerness based on state overlaps (Gram matrices). These results offer a set of semi-device-independent tools for practically and systematically verifying non-stabilizer states using dimensional witnesses in PAM scenarios.</description>

      <title>Can the Infamous Boundary Be Found in Macromolecules? Also, von Neumann vs. Schroedinger ensembles, and `Hund's Paradox' in quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: John Bell coined the phrase ``Infamous Boundary" for the point where classical physics splits off from quantum physics. Many authors, including the present one, have advanced theories with the intention of defining and locating this ``shifty split"; most propose that it lies somewhere on the scale of apparatus. But what if it resides at the level of macromolecules? I show here that this question is intimately connected to the choice of thermal ensembles and to the so-called `Hund's Paradox' in quantum chemistry. I propose an experimental set-up that could in principle reveal the IB lurking in asymmetric macromolecules.</description>

      <title>Energetics of self-organization in a dissipative two-site quantum system driven by single-photon pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding principles of nonequilibrium self-organization in dissipative quantum systems is an open problem. One example is the notion of quantum dissipative adaptation (QDA), that relates the transition probability between the ground states of a quantum system to the nonequilibrium work absorbed during the transition. However, QDA has been originally derived with three-level systems in lambda ({\Lambda}) configuration. Here, we consider a model consisting of a two-site system driven by single-photon pulses. We find that the absorbed work is generally related to the sum of {\Lambda}-type transition probabilities, instead of the direct transition probability between the two ground states. Although this is equivalent to standard QDA in most scenarios, we find an exception whereby optimal self-organization does not maximize work consumption. We show how quantum coherence leaves this kind of imprint in the energetics of self-organization in the present model.</description>

      <title>Converting entanglement into ensemble basis-free coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resource theory of coherence addresses the extent to which quantum properties are present in a given quantum system. While coherence has been extensively studied for individual quantum states, measures of coherence for ensembles of quantum states remain an area of active research. The entanglement-based approach to ensemble coherence - where a partial measurement of an entangled state generates an ensemble - relates the ensemble coherence to both the initial entanglement and the measurement's uncertainty. This paper presents two methods for generating ensemble coherence from a fixed amount of entanglement. The first method involves applying a von Neumann measurement to one part of a non-maximally entangled bipartite state, resulting in a pair of non-orthogonal states whose coherence can equal the initial entanglement. The second method considers a class of symmetric observables capable of generating ensembles used in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols such as B92, BB84, and three-state QKD. As a result, this work contributes to understanding how much ensemble coherence can be obtained from a given amount of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Parallel Repetition for Post-Quantum Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that parallel repetition of public-coin interactive arguments reduces the soundness error at an exponential rate even in the post-quantum setting. Moreover, we generalize this result to hold for threshold verifiers, where the parallel repeated verifier accepts if and only if at least $t$ of the executions are accepted (for some threshold $t$). Prior to this work, these results were known only when the cheating prover was assumed to be classical.
  We also prove a similar result for three-message private-coin arguments. Previously, Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen (STOC 2024) proved such a parallel repetition result in the more general setting of quantum protocols, where the verifier and communication may be quantum. We consider only protocols where the verifier is classical, but obtain a simplified analysis, and for the more general setting of threshold verifiers.</description>

      <title>Euclidean-Monte-Carlo-informed ground-state preparation for quantum simulation of scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer great potential for investigating dynamical properties of quantum field theories. However, preparing accurate non-trivial initial states for these simulations is challenging. Classical Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods provide a wealth of information about states of interest to quantum simulations. Thus, it is desirable to facilitate state preparation on quantum simulators using this information. To this end, we present a fully classical pipeline for generating efficient quantum circuits for preparing the ground state of an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first element of this pipeline is a variational ansatz family based on the stellar hierarchy for bosonic quantum systems. The second element of this pipeline is the classical moment-optimization procedure that augments the standard variational energy minimization by penalizing deviations in selected sets of ground-state correlation functions (i.e., moments). The values of ground-state moments are sourced from classical Euclidean methods. The resulting states yield comparable ground-state energy estimates but exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. The third element of this pipeline is translating the moment-optimized ansatz into an efficient quantum circuit with an asymptotic cost that is polynomial in system size. This work opens the way to systematically applying classically obtained knowledge of states to prepare accurate initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.</description>

      <title>Spin Grouping in Ring Cavity and its Protection on Entangled States Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are essential for large-scale quantum computation and quantum interconnections. Cavities provide a promising avenue to achieve long-range interaction by enhancing the coupling of remote qubits through shared cavity modes. In this work, we investigate a spin array coupled to a ring cavity supporting two counterpropagating modes, focusing on the system's eigenstates and spin dynamics in the low-excitation regime. We show that, under specific spatial configurations, the spins naturally self-organize into two groups, within which exciton transport is confined. This spin-grouping mechanism preserves coherence between spins across the two groups, and is leveraged to deterministically transfer entangled states between remote spin pairs with additional dynamical addressing. We further propose feasible implementations using atomic qubits or solid-state platforms. Our scheme enables entangling remote spins within a cavity, highlighting potential applications in scalable quantum information processing.</description>

And results are compared with the one qubit case for reference. The tripartite atoms-photon-phonon interaction is considered as only three-body resonant interaction while the two-body actions are ignored under some potential approximations. Furthermore, we have studied the phenomenon of hyperradiance in which the well-known Dicke superradiant ($N^2$ scaling law) can be surpassed due to the inter-atomic correlations. Jointly, a parameter regime is explored to observe the entanglement of photon-phonon pairs and their hyperradiance simultaneously. As it is important to show that the generation of photons and phonons are antibunched, the equal time second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ is characterized as witness. This system can be realized in Circuit Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CCQED) in which the direct coupling of the atom and mechanical resonator is possible.We have theoretically investigated an optomechanical system and presented the scenario of significantly enhanced bipartite photon-phonon entanglement for two qubits coupled to the single mode of the cavity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG): Theoretical and Experimental Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) emerged as a promising solution for generating truly random numbers. In the present article, we give an overview of QRNGs highlighting the merits and demerits of various strategies briefly. Then opting for the best-case scenario, we present the in-depth experimental explorations for building and characterizing QRNG using the homodyne detection technique to measure the quadrature amplitude of quantum vacuum fluctuations. Since entropy assessment plays a fundamental role in authenticating the true randomness, a comprehensive description of entropy and how it evaluates the quality of randomness of the source is illustrated. Our experimental setup, apart from the hardware, includes a diverse set of testing techniques including NIST statistical/entropy suites, Dieharder tests battery, and autocorrelation coefficient to verify the randomness and statistical properties of the generated random numbers. We believe that our experimental investigations provide a valuable resource for building QRNGs for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Controlling photon-magnon coupling using another magnon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate photon-mediated magnon-magnon coupling between spatially separated Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and permalloy (NiFe) thin films placed on a planar hexagonal ring resonator. We observe clear signatures of magnon-magnon interaction in the absence of direct dipolar interaction between the magnetic films. Notably, the coupling strength between the hexagonal ring resonator and the permalloy film increases with the thickness of the YIG film, despite a fixed permalloy film thickness, suggesting the presence of an indirect interaction channel mediated by resonator photons. To support these findings, we present a theoretical model that accurately reproduces the observed transmission spectra and reveals a nontrivial interdependence between the individual coupling strengths of YIG and permalloy to the resonator. These results underscore the importance of indirect interactions and potential crosstalk pathways in designing hybrid magnonic systems and scalable quantum architectures, while demonstrating the feasibility of cost-effective, planar configurations for experimental implementation. These insights are valuable for advancing low-loss, coherent information transfer in hybrid quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Can TCOs Transform Cavity-QED?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent conductive oxides (TCO) enable confinement of charge-sensitive ions and Rydberg atoms proximal to dielectric structures including waveguides and photon detectors. However, optical loss precludes the use of TCOs within high-finesse optical micro-resonators. Here we characterize a ZnO-based TCO that markedly reduces optical absorption. At 1650\text{ nm} we observe a 22,000 finesse in a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity coated with a 30\text{ nm} ZnO layer. This is a 5000 times reduction relative to indium tin oxide (ITO) at this wavelength. The same ZnO film exhibits 0.01\text{ \ensuremath{\Omega}\ensuremath{\cdot}cm} surface resistivity at DC. We anticipate a step change in cavity-QED systems incorporating ultra-low loss TCOs like ZnO.</description>

      <title>Polaromechanical cooling of multiple mechanical modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two different configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which makes it possible to prepare and control mechanical states via manipulating the polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and show how multiple mechanical modes can be simultaneously cooled by using polaritons with a single drive field. This is achieved by exploiting the great tunability of the polariton frequencies. Specifically, $N$ polaritons can be tuned to resonantly enhance the anti-Stokes scatterings associated with $N$ mechanical modes, leading to the cooling of all the mechanical modes at once. We explicitly show how such polaromechanical cooling can simultaneously cool two mechanical modes, and then discuss how to apply it to cool multiple mechanical modes and to various polaromechanical systems, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Superconducting integrated random access quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for the development of quantum repeaters and resource-efficient quantum processors. We report the experimental realization of a novel architecture of superconducting random access quantum memory with cycling storage time, achieved through pulsed control of an RF-SQUID coupling element. The device demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and achieves 57.5\% fidelity with preservation of the input pulse shape during the first retrieval interval for near-single-photon level excitations, with subsequent exponential decay characterized by a time constant of 11.44 $\mu s$. This performance represents a several-fold improvement over previously reported implementations. Crucially, we establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching imperfections. These results highlight the potential of proposed architecture for quantum memory applications while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</description>

      <title>Classical pair of states as optimal pair for quantum distinguishability quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability to quantitatively distinguish quantum states is of great importance for a variety of tasks, and has recently played an important role in the study of quantum reduced dynamics and their characterization in terms of memory effects. A crucial property of quantum distinguishability quantifiers considered in the latter framework is the contractivity under the action of completely positive trace-preserving maps. We show that this requirement warrants that the pairs on which these quantifiers attain their maximal value are pairs of orthogonal, and in this sense classical, states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two quantum experiments - modified Bell tests - that could detect contextual hidden variables underlying quantum mechanics. The experiments are inspired by hydrodynamic pilot-wave systems that mimic a wide range of quantum effects and exhibit a classical analog of contextuality. To justify the experiments, we show that contextual hidden variables are 'physics as usual' if a unification between quantum mechanics and general relativity is possible. Accordingly, contextual theories can bypass Bell's theorem in a way that is both local and non-conspiratorial. We end with a note on the relevance of exploratory experiments in the foundations of quantum physics.</description>

      <title>The Initial Experimental Guide to Implement QKD Polarization Encoding System at Telecom Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental implementation of the polarization encoding system is presented using weak coherent pulses at a low enough frequency. The optical pulses are generated through intensity modulation at the repetition rate of $10$ pulses/sec with the intensity of $7\mu W$, whose polarization is modulated by the Pockel cell. For a $ 5$ km long fiber link, the key rate is thus limited to $ 10$ bits/sec accompanied by temporal synchronization among the Intensity Modulator (IM), Pockel cell, and the gate of the detector. The system was continuously operated for $5$ minutes, and $3000$ binary bits were distributed between two nodes with an error rate less than unity. We have used only a single polarization basis, i.e., horizontal and vertical polarizations, as the objective of this experiment is to validate the feasibility of the setup under simplified conditions, intended primarily for the laboratory-scale demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Adiabaticity violation under arbitrarily slow evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum adiabatic theorem, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, asserts that a gapped quantum system remains in its instantaneous eigenstate during sufficiently slow evolution, provided no resonances occur. Here we challenge this principle and show that adiabaticity can be violated even in arbitrarily slow processes. We introduce two new parameters, Instantaneous Transition Accumulation (ITA) and Instantaneous Transition Probability (ITP), to redefine the framework of adiabatic evolution. These parameters, grounded in cross-Berry connections and eigenstate amplitudes, reveal the dynamic and geometric factors governing adiabaticity. Using a new Phase Difference Manipulation (PDM) method, we control ITP and ITA to induce adiabaticity violation in a Landau-Zener (LZ) process. We experimentally demonstrate this counterintuitive phenomenon in a photonic waveguide system, where a slow LZ process defies adiabaticity, switching energy levels despite a fivefold slower evolution speed than a conventional adiabatic process. This discovery reshapes our understanding of quantum evolution and holds potential for quantum computing, topological physics, and photonic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-sensitivity quantum detection of a resonant classical force acting on a quantum oscillator can be substantially enhanced through the use of a resonant optical parametric transducer. We demonstrate that this approach not only enables quantum back-action evasion measurements that exceed the Standard Quantum Limit of sensitivity but also facilitates the noiseless amplification of the classical signal. This amplification is achieved by independently measuring the two modulation sidebands generated by the signal force, allowing for a more precise and noise-resistant detection process.</description>

      <title>Self-attention U-Net decoder for toric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the NISQ era, one of the most important bottlenecks for the realization of universal quantum computation is error correction. Stabiliser code is the most recognizable type of quantum error correction code. A scalable efficient decoder is most desired for the application of the quantum error correction codes. In this work, we propose a self-attention U-Net quantum decoder (SU-NetQD) for toric code, which outperforms the minimum weight perfect matching decoder, especially in the circuit level noise environments. Specifically, with our SU-NetQD, we achieve lower logical error rates compared with MWPM and discover an increased trend of code threshold as the increase of noise bias. We obtain a high threshold of 0.231 for the extremely biased noise environment. The combination of low-level decoder and high-level decoder is the key innovation for the high accuracy of our decoder. With transfer learning mechanics, our decoder is scalable for cases with different code distances. Our decoder provides a practical tool for quantum noise analysis and promotes the practicality of quantum error correction codes and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Stacking the Odds: Full-Stack Quantum System Design Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design space exploration (DSE) plays an important role in optimising quantum circuit execution by systematically evaluating different configurations of compilation strategies and hardware settings. In this work, we study the impact of layout methods, qubit routing techniques, compiler optimization levels, and hardware-specific properties, including noise characteristics, topological structures, connectivity densities, and device sizes. By traversing these dimensions, we aim to understand how compilation choices interact with hardware features. A central question in our study is whether carefully selected device parameters and mapping strategies, including initial layouts and routing heuristics, can mitigate hardware-induced errors beyond standard error mitigation methods. Our results show that choosing the right software strategies (e.g., layout and routing) and tailoring hardware properties (e.g., reducing noise or leveraging connectivity) significantly enhances the fidelity of quantum circuit executions. We provide performance estimates using metrics such as circuit depth, gate count, and expected fidelity. These findings highlight the value of hardware-software co-design, especially as quantum systems scale and move toward error-corrected computing. Our simulations, though noisy, include quantum error correction (QEC) scenarios, revealing similar sensitivities to layout and connectivity. This suggests that co-design principles will be vital for integrating QEC in future devices. Overall, we offer practical guidance for co-optimizing mapping, routing, and hardware configuration in real-world quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Matrix Elements of Fermionic Gaussian Operators in Arbitrary Pauli Bases: A Pfaffian Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian operators are foundational tools in quantum many-body theory, numerical simulation of fermionic dynamics, and fermionic linear optics. While their structure is fully determined by two-point correlations, evaluating their matrix elements in arbitrary local spin bases remains a nontrivial task, especially in applications involving quantum measurements, tomography, and basis-rotated simulations. In this work, we derive a fully explicit and general Pfaffian formula for the matrix elements of fermionic Gaussian operators between arbitrary Pauli product states. Our approach introduces a pair of sign-encoding matrices whose classification leads to a Lie algebra isomorphic to $\mathfrak{so}(2L)$. This algebraic structure not only guarantees consistency of the Pfaffian signs but also reveals deep connections to Clifford algebras. The resulting framework enables scalable computations across diverse fields -- from quantum tomography and entanglement dynamics to algebraic structure in fermionic circuits and matchgate computation. Beyond its practical utility, our construction sheds light on the internal symmetries of Gaussian operators and offers a new lens through which to explore their role in quantum information and computational models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phase estimation in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using q-deformed photon states, including q-coherent and q-cat states, which model realistic deviations from ideal light sources. By deriving closed-form photon count likelihoods via the Jordan-Schwinger mapping, we compute the quantum and classical Fisher information and perform Bayesian inference on simulated detector data. Our results show that photon counting remains an optimal measurement strategy even for deformed states, with classical and quantum Fisher information in exact agreement. Furthermore, the phase sensitivity improves with increasing q-deformation, indicating enhanced metrological performance driven by nonclassical photon statistics. These findings highlight the utility of q-deformed states in quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a universal thermodynamic framework for quantum systems that may be strongly coupled to thermal environments. Unlike previous approaches, our method enables a clear definition of thermostatic properties while preserving the same gauge freedoms as in the standard weak-coupling regime and retaining the von Neumann expression for thermodynamic entropy. Furthermore, it provides a formulation of general first and second laws using only variables accessible through microscopic control of the system, thereby enhancing experimental feasibility. We validate the framework by applying it to a paradigmatic model of strong coupling with a structured bosonic reservoir.</description>

Abstract: We investigate spectral singularities in an alkali-metal atomic vapor modeled using four and effectively three hyperfine states. By comparing the eigenvalue spectra of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) and a Liouvillian superoperator, we analyze the emergence and characteristics of both semiclassical and quantum exceptional points. Our results reveal that, for atomic systems, the NHH approach alone may be insufficient to fully capture the system's spectral properties. While NHHs can yield accurate predictions in certain regimes, a comprehensive description typically requires the Liouvillian formalism, which governs the Lindblad master equation and explicitly incorporates quantum jump processes responsible for repopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum jumps fundamentally alters the spectral structure of the system. In particular, we present examples in which the existence, location in parameter space, or even the order of spectral degeneracies differ significantly between the two approaches, thereby highlighting the impact of quantum jumps and the limitations of the NHH method. Finally, using the hybrid-Liouvillian formalism, we show how quantum jumps reshape spectral features initially predicted by the NHH, ultimately determining the full Liouvillian spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Data Centers: Why Entanglement Changes Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Internet is key for distributed quantum computing, by interconnecting multiple quantum processors into a virtual quantum computation system. This allows to scale the number of qubits, by overcoming the inherent limitations of noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Thus, the Quantum Internet is the foundation for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Among the distributed architectures, Quantum Data Centers emerge as the most viable in the medium-term, since they integrate multiple quantum processors within a localized network infrastructure, by allowing modular design of quantum networking. We analyze the physical and topological constraints of Quantum Data Centers, by emphasizing the role of entanglement orchestrators in dynamically reconfiguring network topologies through local operations. We examine the major hardware challenge of quantum transduction, essential for interfacing heterogeneous quantum systems. Furthermore, we explore how interconnecting multiple Quantum Data Centers could enable large-scale quantum networks. We discuss the topological constraints of such a scaling and identify open challenges, including entanglement routing and synchronization. The carried analysis positions Quantum Data Centers as both a practical implementation platform and strategic framework for the future Quantum Internet.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02970v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Convergence and efficiency proof of quantum imaginary time evolution for bounded order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many current and near-future applications of quantum computing utilise parametric families of quantum circuits and variational methods to find optimal values for these parameters. Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineered Fast SNAP gates in weakly coupled cQED systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting cavities with high quality factors, coupled to a fixed-frequency transmon, provide a state-of-the-art platform for quantum information storage and manipulation. The commonly used selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gate faces significant challenges in ultra-high-coherence cavities, where the weak dispersive shifts necessary for preserving high coherence typically result in prolonged gate times. Here, we propose a protocol to achieve high-fidelity SNAP gates that are orders of magnitude faster than the standard implementation, surpassing the speed limit set by the bare dispersive shift. We achieve this enhancement by dynamically amplifying the dispersive coupling via sideband interactions, followed by quantum optimal control on the Floquet-engineered system. We also present a unified perturbation theory that explains both the gate acceleration and the associated benign drive-induced decoherence, corroborated by Floquet-Markov simulations. These results pave the way for the experimental realization of high-fidelity, selective control of weakly coupled, high-coherence cavities, and expanding the scope of optimal control techniques to a broader class of Floquet quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement incompatibility and quantum steering via linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of deciding whether a set of quantum measurements is jointly measurable is known to be equivalent to determining whether a quantum assemblage is unsteerable. This problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP). However, the number of variables and constraints in such a formulation grows exponentially with the number of measurements, rendering it intractable for large measurement sets. In this work, we circumvent this problem by transforming the SDP into a hierarchy of linear programs that compute upper and lower bounds on the incompatibility robustness with a complexity that grows polynomially in the number of measurements. The hierarchy is guaranteed to converge and it can be applied to arbitrary measurements -- including non-projective POVMs -- in arbitrary dimensions. While convergence becomes impractical in high dimensions, in the case of qubits our method reliably provides accurate upper and lower bounds for the incompatibility robustness of sets with several hundred measurements in a short time using a standard laptop. We also apply our methods to qutrits, obtaining non-trivial upper and lower bounds in scenarios that are otherwise intractable using the standard SDP approach. Finally, we show how our methods can be used to construct local hidden state models for states, or conversely, to certify that a given state exhibits steering; for two-qubit quantum states, our approach is comparable to, and in some cases outperforms, the current best methods.</description>

      <title>Adversarial quantum channel discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantum channel discrimination in an adversarial setting, where the tester plays against an adversary who accesses the environmental system and possesses internal quantum memory to perform adaptive strategies. We show that in asymmetric hypothesis testing, the optimal type-II error exponent is precisely characterized by the minimum output channel divergence, a new notion of quantum channel divergence in the worst-case scenario. This serves as a direct analog of the quantum Stein's lemma in the adversarial channel discrimination. Notably, the optimal error exponent can be achieved via simple non-adaptive strategies by the adversary, and its value can be efficiently computed despite its regularization. The strong converse property for quantum channel discrimination also holds in general. This adversarial quantum Stein's lemma is proved by new chain rules for measured and sandwiched relative entropies. Moreover, we derive a generalized version of the entropy accumulation theorem between two arbitrary sequences of quantum channels, extending the existing results from entropy to divergence and providing a solution to the dual formulation of the open problem presented in [IEEE FOCS, pp. 844-850 (2022)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the bicycle architecture, a modular quantum computing framework based on high-rate, low-overhead quantum LDPC codes identified in prior work. For two specific bivariate bicycle codes with distances 12 and 18, we construct explicit fault-tolerant logical instruction sets and estimate the logical error rate of the instructions under circuit noise. We develop a compilation strategy adapted to the constraints of the bicycle architecture, enabling large-scale universal quantum circuit execution. Integrating these components, we perform end-to-end resource estimates demonstrating that an order of magnitude larger logical circuits can be implemented with a given number of physical qubits on the bicycle architecture than on surface code architectures. We anticipate further improvements through advances in code constructions, circuit designs, and compilation techniques.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurement of time delay with frequency-resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of weak coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a scheme for high-precision measurements of time delay based on frequency-resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference. Our approach is applied to weak coherent states and exploits an array of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). Unlike conventional HOM experiments, our setup enables high-precision measurements even for photons separated by delays much greater than their coherence time. This result confirms our newly developed theoretical predictions that consider, differently from previous theoretical results, a finite frequency resolution in the detection. We compare the performance of this scheme against the conventional non-resolved case. Experimental data align well with the predictions of quantum estimation theory, demonstrating a significant reduction in the uncertainty. Due to the physics of the frequency-resolved HOM effect, the gain in precision is particularly high when the estimated time delay is much longer than the coherence time.</description>

      <title>Efficient QAOA Architecture for Solving Multi-Constrained Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of constraint encoding methods for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Ansatz (QAOA). Real-world optimization problems typically consist of multiple types of constraints. To solve these optimization problems with quantum methods, typically all constraints are added as quadratic penalty terms to the objective. However, this technique expands the search space and increases problem complexity. This work focuses on a general workflow that extracts and encodes specific constraints directly into the circuit of QAOA: One-hot constraints are enforced through $XY$-mixers that restrict the search space to the feasible sub-space naturally. Inequality constraints are implemented through oracle-based Indicator Functions (IF). We test the performance by simulating the combined approach for solving the Multi-Knapsack (MKS) and the Prosumer Problem (PP), a modification of the MKS in the domain of electricity optimization. To this end, we introduce computational techniques that efficiently simulate the two presented constraint architectures. Since $XY$-mixers restrict the search space, specific state vector entries are always zero and can be omitted from the simulation, saving valuable memory and computing resources. We benchmark the combined method against the established QUBO formulation, yielding a better solution quality and probability of sampling the optimal solution. Despite more complex circuits, the time-to-solution is more than an order of magnitude faster compared to the baseline methods and exhibits more favorable scaling properties.</description>

Abstract: While experimental advancements continue to expand the capabilities to control and probe non-equilibrium quantum matter at an unprecedented level, the numerical simulation of the dynamics of correlated quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge - especially in intermediate spatial dimensions. Neural quantum states are emerging as a new computational tool to investigate the time evolution of many-body quantum systems in previously inaccessible regimes. We review the recent progress in the field with a focus on the different time propagation methods, an overview of the reported applications, and a discussion of the major current challenges.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Memory Implementation of the Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of dissipative quantum dynamics subject to a non-Markovian environment poses persistent numerical challenges, in particular for structured environments where sharp mode resonances induce long-time system bath correlations. We present a scalable distributed memory implementation of the Mask Assisted Coarse Graining of Influence Coefficients (MACGIC) - Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral (-QUAPI) method that exploits the memory resources of multiple compute nodes and mitigates the memory bottleneck of the method via a new pre-merging algorithm while preserving numerical accuracy. The distributed memory implementation spreads the paths over the computing nodes by means of the MPI protocoll and efficient high level path management is achieved via an implementation based on hash maps. The efficiency of the new implementation is demonstrated in large-scale dissipative quantum dynamics simulations that account for the coupling to a structured non-Markovian environment containing a sharp resonance, a setup for which convergence properties are investigated in depth. Broad applicability and the non-perturbative nature of the simulation method is illustrated via the tuning of the mode resonance frequency of the structured environment with respect to the system frequency. The simulations reveal a splitting of resonances due to strong system-environment interaction and the emergence of sidebands due to multi-excitations of the bosonic mode that are not accounted for in perturbative approaches. The simulations demonstrate the versatility of the new MACGIC-QUAPI method in the presence of strong non-Markovian system bath correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crosstalk is a key obstacle to scaling up quantum computers. It may arise from persistent qubit-qubit couplings or dynamically during gate operation, with the latter being particularly difficult to detect. Here, we introduce the perfect entangler spectrum as a means to identify dynamic crosstalk leading to undesired entanglement. It leverages the geometric classification of two-qubit gates in terms of perfect entanglers. We exemplify application of the spectroscopy for fixed-frequency transmons and parametrically driven gates: When scanning the frequency of a spectator qubit, peaks in the perfect entangler spectrum signal dynamic crosstalk, and analysis of the peaks reveals the mechanisms causing the crosstalk. We discuss the experimental implementation of the crosstalk spectroscopy which requires two two-qubit gate tomographies.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of discord, including a holography-inspired one based on multi-entropy. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on the trace of any 2-positive, trace-preserving map in terms of its smallest eigenvalue. We show that this spectral bound is tight, and that 2-positivity is necessary for this inequality to hold in general. Moreover, we use this to infer a similar bound for generators of one-parameter semigroups of 2-positive trace-preserving maps. With this approach we generalize known results for completely positive trace-preserving dynamics while providing a significantly simpler proof that is entirely algebraic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based wavefunction ansatz as viable representations for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Through systematic analysis of one-dimensional model systems, we evaluate their computational efficiency and representational power against established methods. Our numerical experiments suggest some efficient training methods and we explore how the computational cost scales with desired precision, particle number, and system parameters. Roughly speaking, KANs seem to be 10 times cheaper computationally than other neural network based ansatz. We also introduce a novel approach for handling strong short-range potentials-a persistent challenge for many numerical techniques-which generalizes efficiently to higher-dimensional, physically relevant systems with short-ranged strong potentials common in atomic and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnon band topology and associated topological edge states (TESs) in Neel-type ferromagnetic skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, using parameters relevant to monolayer CrI3. Employing stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and discrete Holstein-Primakoff bosonization, we analyze the impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice structure on the magnonic spectrum, in contrast to the extensively studied triangular spin-lattice SkXs. Our analysis identifies topological features unique to the honeycomb lattice. In particular, certain characteristic magnon modes (e.g., elliptical distortion and triangular distortion modes) acquire nontrivial Chern numbers absent in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, contrary to predictions based on triangular spin-lattice SkXs, we find that the counterclockwise (CCW)-breathing magnonic gap exhibits topological behavior only at large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI), losing its universality with decreasing DMI strength. Meanwhile, the second magnon gap consistently hosts robust TESs across the entire range of DMI and magnetic fields studied, closing at critical fields through field-induced topological phase transitions. The study further uncovers a remarkable richness in the magnon topology, identifying 65 distinct topological magnon phases generated by magnetic-field-driven skyrmion deformation. These findings underscore the profound role of lattice geometry in shaping magnon topology in non-collinear spin textures.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical trapping of aluminum monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optical trapping of molecules has thus far been restricted to molecules with $^2\Sigma$ electronic ground states. These species are chemically reactive and only support a simple laser cooling scheme from their first excited rotational level. Here, we demonstrate a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of aluminum monofluoride (AlF), a deeply bound and intrinsically stable diatomic molecule with a $^1\Sigma^+$ electronic ground state. The MOT operates on the strong A$^1\Pi\leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition near 227.5~nm, whose Q$(J)$ lines are all rotationally closed. We demonstrate a MOT of about $6\times 10^4$ molecules for the $J=1$ level of AlF, more than $10^4$ molecules for $J=2$ and $3$, and with no fundamental limit in going to higher rotational levels. Laser cooling and trapping of AlF is conceptually similar to the introduction of alkaline-earth atoms into cold atom physics, and is key to leveraging its spin-forbidden a$^3\Pi \leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition for precision spectroscopy and narrow-line cooling.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode cooling of a Bose-Einstein condensate with linear quantum feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate measurement-based feedback control over the motional degrees of freedom of an oblate quasi-2D atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to continuous density monitoring. We develop a linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) model that describes the multi-mode dynamics of the condensate's collective excitations under continuous measurement and control. Crucially, the multi-mode cold-damping feedback control we consider uses a realistic state-estimation scheme that does not rely upon a particular model of the atomic dynamics. We present analytical results showing that collective excitations can be cooled to below single-phonon average occupation (ground-state cooling) across a broad parameter regime and identify the conditions under which the lowest steady-state phonon occupation is asymptotically achieved. Further, we develop multi-objective optimization methods that explore the trade-off between cooling speed and the final energy of the cloud and provide numerical simulations demonstrating the ground-state cooling of the lowest ten motional modes above the condensate ground state. Our investigation provides concrete guidance on the feedback control design and parameters needed to experimentally realize a feedback-cooled BEC.</description>

      <title>Synthetic crystal rotation with spacetime metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with rotating bodies has been historically limited to rotation frequencies much smaller than optical frequencies. Here, we investigate synthetic crystal rotations, i.e., spatiotemporal modulations mimicking the rotation of an anisotropic crystal, which grant access to large rotation frequencies. Spatiotemporal modulations change the fundamental symmetries of the electromagnetic field, breaking temporal and rotation symmetries, but preserving a spatiotemporal rotation symmetry that enforces the conservation of a combination of energy and spin angular momentum (SAM). The scattering of optical pulses by synthetically rotating crystals results in spatiotemporal light with intra-pulse SAM changes. The frequency-domain response reveals sidebands with frequency/SAM locking, and negative frequency sideband transitions for large enough rotation frequencies. Our results highlight the qualitatively different light-matter interaction regimes accessed by synthetic rotations.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular and strongly walk-regular graphs that admit perfect state transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study perfect state transfer in Grover walks on two important classes of graphs: strongly regular graphs and strongly walk-regular graphs. The latter class is a generalization of the former. We first give a complete classification of strongly regular graphs that admit perfect state transfer. The only such graphs are the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,2}$ and the complete tripartite graph $K_{2,2,2}$. We then show that, if a genuine strongly walk-regular graph admits perfect state transfer, then its spectrum must be of the form $\{[k]^1, [\frac{k}{2}]^{\alpha}, [0]^{\beta}, [-\frac{k}{2}]^{\gamma}\}$, and we enumerate all feasible spectra of this form up to $k=20$ with the help of a computer. These results are obtained using techniques from algebraic number theory and spectral graph theory, particularly through the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenprojections of a normalized adjacency matrix. While the setting is in quantum walks, the core discussion is developed entirely within the framework of spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Transverse Distance Estimation with Higher-Order Hermite-Gauss modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of higher-order Hermite-Gauss modes for sensing optically induced transverse displacements. In the small-displacement regime, we show that projective measurements onto the two neighboring spatial modes yield optimal Fisher information, linearly scaling with the mode order $m$. We further extend the analysis to arbitrary displacement values and derive general expressions for the Fisher information, demonstrating that higher-order modes continue to outperform the fundamental Gaussian mode even at larger separations. This approach enables enhanced displacement sensitivity with only a minimal number of measurements, offering a simple and scalable alternative to conventional Spatial Mode Demultiplexing schemes. We provide a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration using spatial light modulators, showing an order-of-magnitude reduction in estimation variance when employing Hermite-Gauss modes of order $m = 8$ and $m = 17$. These results highlight the potential of structured light for ultrasensitive displacement sensing and may enable new applications in birefringence measurements with broadband or low-coherence light sources.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered decoherence-resilient protocols for wideband sensing beyond the linear standard quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key advantage of quantum metrology is the ability to surpass the standard quantum limit for measurement precision through the use of non-classical states. However, there is typically little to no improvement in precision with the use of non-classical states for measurements whose duration exceeds the decoherence time of the underlying quantum states. Measurements aimed at the ultimate possible precision are thus performed almost exclusively with classical states and, therefore, are constrained by the standard quantum limit. Here, we demonstrate that by using the phenomenon of subharmonic excitation, in combination with a recently demonstrated technique of Raman excitation of a harmonic oscillator, the frequency of an electric field can be measured at a resolution below the standard quantum limit of the corresponding linear measurement. As the input states can be classical, this metrological gain persists to long timescales and improves the ultimate possible precision. While we demonstrate this technique using motional Raman subharmonic excitation of a single 40ca^+ ion through engineered Floquet states, this technique is expected to be extendable to other platforms, such as NV centers, solid-state qubits, and neutral atoms, where it can provide metrological gain for sensing across the radio frequency, microwave, and optical domains.</description>

      <title>$^{229}$Th Nuclear Spectroscopy in an Opaque Material: Laser-Based Conversion Electron M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy of $^{229}$ThO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we report the first demonstration of laser-induced conversion electron M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy of the $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric state, which provides the ability to probe the nuclear transition in a material that is opaque to light resonant with the nuclear transition. Specifically, we excite the nuclear transition in a thin ThO$_2$ sample whose band gap ($\sim$ 6 eV) is considerably smaller than the nuclear isomeric state energy (8.4 eV). As a result, the excited nucleus can quickly decay by internal conversion, resulting in the ejection of electrons from the surface. By collecting these conversion electrons, nuclear spectroscopy can be recorded. Unlike fluorescence spectroscopy, this technique is compatible with materials whose work function is less than the nuclear transition energy, opening a wider class of systems to study. Further, because ThO$_2$ can be made from spinless isotopes and the internal conversion decay process reduces the isomeric state lifetime to only $\sim$10 $\mu$s, allowing $\sim$10$^8$ relative reduction in clock interrogation time, a conversion-electron-based nuclear clock could lead to a $\sim$10$^4$ reduction in clock instability.</description>

      <title>Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.01371v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable devices which can implement arbitrary unitary operations are crucial for photonic quantum computation, optical neural networks, and boson sampling. Here, we address the problem of, using multiport interferometers, approximating with a given infidelity any pure state preparation and any unitary operation. By means of numerical calculations, we show that pure states, in any dimension $d$, can be prepared with infidelity $\le 10^{-15}$ with three layers of $d$ dimensional Fourier transforms and three layers of configurable phase shifters. We also present numerical evidence that $d+1$ layers of $d$-dimensional Fourier transforms and $d+2$ layers of configurable phase shifters can produce any unitary operation with infidelity $\le 10^{-14}$. The conclusions are achieved by numerical simulations in the range from $d = 3$ to $d=10$. These results are interesting in light of the recent availability of multicore fiber-integrated multiport interferometers.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation for rotation symmetric bosonic codes with symmetry expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotation symmetric bosonic code (RSBC) is a unified framework of practical bosonic codes that have rotation symmetries, such as cat codes and binomial codes. While cat codes achieve the break-even point in which the coherence time of the encoded qubits exceeds that of unencoded qubits, with binomial codes nearly approaching that point, the state preparation fidelity needs to be still improved for practical quantum computing. Concerning this problem, we investigate the framework of symmetry expansion, a class of quantum error mitigation that virtually projects the state onto the noise-free symmetric subspace by exploiting the system's intrinsic symmetries and post-processing of measurement outcomes. Although symmetry expansion has been limited to error mitigation of quantum states immediately before measurement, we successfully generalize symmetry expansion for state preparation. To implement our method, we use an ancilla qubit and only two controlled-rotation gates via dispersive interactions between the bosonic code states and the ancilla qubit. Interestingly, this method also allows us to virtually prepare the RSBC states only from easy-to-prepare states, e.g., coherent states. We also discuss that the conventional symmetry expansion protocol can be applied to improve the computation fidelity when the symmetries of rotation bosonic codes are unavailable due to low measurement fidelity. By giving comprehensive analytical and numerical arguments regarding the trace distance between the error-mitigated state and the ideal state and the sampling cost of quantum error mitigation, we show that symmetry expansion dramatically suppresses the effect of photon loss. Our novel error mitigation method will significantly enhance computation accuracy in the near-term bosonic quantum computing paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paradigm behind digital quantum computing inherits the idea of using binary information processing. Nature in fact gives much more rich structures of physical objects that can be used for encoding information, which is especially interesting in the quantum-mechanical domain. In this Colloquium several ideas are reviewed that indicate how multilevel quantum systems, also known as qudits, can be used for efficient realization of quantum algorithms, which are represented via standard qubit circuits. The focus in the Colloquium is on techniques for leveraging qudits for simplifying decomposition of multiqubit gates and for compressing quantum information by encoding multiple qubits in a single qudit. As discussed in the Colloquium, these approaches can be efficiently combined. This allows a reduction in the number of entangling (two-body) operations and the number of quantum information carriers used compared to straightforward qubit realizations. These theoretical schemes can be implemented with quantum computing platforms of various natures, such as trapped ions, neutral atoms, superconducting junctions, quantum light, spin systems, and molecules. The Colloquium concludes by summarizing a set of open problems whose resolution will be an important further step toward employing universal qudit-based processors for running qubit algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The challenge of determining bounds for the minimal number of vectors in a three-dimensional Kochen-Specker (KS) set has captivated the quantum foundations community for decades. This paper establishes a weak lower bound of 10 vectors, which does not surpass the current best-known bound of 24 vectors. By exploring the complementary concept of large non-KS sets and employing a probability argument independent of the graph structure of KS sets, we introduce a novel technique that could be applied in the future to derive tighter bounds. Additionally, we highlight an intriguing connection to a generalisation of the moving sofa problem in navigating a right-angled hallway on the surface of a two-dimensional sphere.</description>

      <title>An Entanglement Monotone from the Contextual Fraction</title>

Abstract: The contextual fraction introduced by Abramsky and Brandenburger defines a quantitative measure of contextuality associated with empirical models, i.e. tables of probabilities of measurement outcomes in experimental scenarios. In this paper we define an entanglement monotone relying on the contextual fraction. We first show that any separable state is necessarily non-contextual with respect to any Bell scenario. Then, for 2-qubit states, we associate a state-dependent Bell scenario and show that the corresponding contextual fraction is an entanglement monotone, suggesting contextuality may be regarded as a refinement of entanglement. We call this monotone the quarter-turn contextual fraction (QTCF), and use it to set an upper bound of approximately 0.601 for the minimum entanglement entropy needed to guarantee contextuality with respect to some Bell scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology with Higher-order Exceptional Points in Atom-cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), which arose early from non-Hermitian physics, significantly amplify the system's response to minor perturbations, and they act as a useful concept to enhance measurement in metrology. In particular, such a metrological enhancement grows dramatically with the EP's order. However, the Langevin noises intrinsically existing in the non-Hermitian systems diminish this enhancement. In this study, we propose a protocol for quantum metrology with the construction of higher-order EPs (HOEPs) in an atom-cavity system through Hermitian magnon-photon interaction. The construction of HOEPs utilizes the atom-cavity non-Hermitian-like dynamical behavior but avoids the external Langevin noises via the Hermitian interaction. A general analysis is exhibited for the construction of arbitrary -order EP (EPn). As a demonstration of the superiority of these HOEPs in quantum metrology, we work out an EP3/4-based atomic sensor with sensitivity being orders of magnitude higher than that achievable in an EP2-based atomic sensor. We further unveil the mechanism behind the sensitivity enhancement from HOEPs. The experimental establishment for this proposal is suggested with potential candidates. This EP-based atomic sensor, taking advantage of the atom-light interface, offers new insight into quantum metrology with HOEPs.</description>

      <title>Quartic quantum speedups for planted inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a quantum algorithm for the Planted Noisy $k$XOR problem (also known as sparse Learning Parity with Noise) that achieves a nearly quartic ($4$th power) speedup over the best known classical algorithm while also only using logarithmically many qubits. Our work generalizes and simplifies prior work of Hastings, by building on his quantum algorithm for the Tensor Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem. We achieve our quantum speedup using a general framework based on the Kikuchi Method (recovering the quartic speedup for Tensor PCA), and we anticipate it will yield similar speedups for further planted inference problems. These speedups rely on the fact that planted inference problems naturally instantiate the Guided Sparse Hamiltonian problem. Since the Planted Noisy $k$XOR problem has been used as a component of certain cryptographic constructions, our work suggests that some of these are susceptible to super-quadratic quantum attacks.</description>

Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and its extensions are increasingly popular frameworks for developing quantum algorithms. Yet QSP implementations still struggle to complete a classical pre-processing step ('QSP-processing') that determines the set of $SU(2)$ rotation matrices defining the QSP circuit. We introduce a method of QSP-processing for complex polynomials that identifies a solution without optimization or root-finding and verify the success of our methods with polynomials characterized by floating point precision coefficients. We demonstrate the success of our technique for relevant target polynomials and precision regimes, including the Jacobi-Anger expansion used in QSP Hamiltonian Simulation. For popular choices of sign and inverse function approximations, we characterize regimes where all known QSP-processing methods should be expected to struggle without arbitrary precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to identify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of R\'enyi Entropy on Quantum Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-space versions of quantum mechanics -- from Wigner's original distribution to modern discrete-qudit constructions -- represent some states with negative quasi-probabilities. Conventional Shannon and R\'enyi entropies become complex-valued in this setting and lose their operational meaning. Building on the axiomatic treatments of R\'enyi (1961) and Dar\'oczy (1963), we develop a conservative extension that applies to signed, finite phase spaces and discover a single admissible entropy family, which we call signed R\'enyi entropy. The obvious signed Shannon candidate is ruled out because it violates extensivity. We prove four results that bolster the usefulness of the new measure. (i) It serves as a witness of negative probability. (ii) For every even integer order it is Schur-concave, delivering the intuitive property that more mixing increases entropy. (iii) The same parametric family obeys a quantum H-theorem, namely, that under de-phasing dynamics entropy cannot decrease. (iv) The order-two entropy is conserved under discrete Moyal-bracket dynamics, mirroring conservation of von Neumann entropy under unitary evolution on Hilbert space. We also comment on interpreting the R\'enyi order parameter as inverse temperature. Overall, we believe that our investigation provides good evidence that our axiomatically derived signed R\'enyi entropy may be a useful addition to existing entropy measures used in quantum information, foundations, and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Temperature Distributions for Training Neural Quantum States using Parallel Tempering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterized artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be very expressive ansatzes for variational algorithms, reaching state-of-the-art energies on many quantum many-body Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, the training of the ANN can be slow and stymied by the presence of local minima in the parameter landscape. One approach to mitigate this issue is to use parallel tempering methods, and in this work we focus on the role played by the temperature distribution of the parallel tempering replicas. Using an adaptive method that adjusts the temperatures in order to equate the exchange probability between neighboring replicas, we show that this temperature optimization can significantly increase the success rate of the variational algorithm with negligible computational cost by eliminating bottlenecks in the replicas' random walk. We demonstrate this using two different neural networks, a restricted Boltzmann machine and a feedforward network, which we use to study a toy problem based on a permutation invariant Hamiltonian with a pernicious local minimum and the J1-J2 model on a rectangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Real classical shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently learning expectation values of a quantum state using classical shadow tomography has become a fundamental task in quantum information theory. In a classical shadows protocol, one measures a state in a chosen basis W after it has evolved under a unitary transformation randomly sampled from a chosen distribution U. In this work we study the case where U corresponds to either local or global orthogonal Clifford gates, and W consists of real-valued vectors. Our results show that for various situations of interest, this ``real'' classical shadow protocol improves the sample complexity over the standard scheme based on general Clifford unitaries. For example, when one is interested in estimating the expectation values of arbitrary real-valued observables, global orthogonal Cliffords decrease the required number of samples by a factor of two. More dramatically, for k-local observables composed only of real-valued Pauli operators, sampling local orthogonal Cliffords leads to a reduction by an exponential-in-k factor in the sample complexity over local unitary Cliffords. Finally, we show that by measuring in a basis containing complex-valued vectors, orthogonal shadows can, in the limit of large system size, exactly reproduce the original unitary shadows protocol.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) states that in the limit of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random experiments, the output sequence is virtually certain to come from the typical set, each member of which is almost equally likely. This property is a form of the law of large numbers and lies at the heart of information theory. In this work, we prove a generalized quantum AEP beyond the i.i.d. framework where the random samples are drawn from two sets of quantum states. In particular, under suitable assumptions on the sets, we prove that all operationally relevant divergences converge to the quantum relative entropy between the sets. More specifically, both the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy (a smoothed form of the min-relative entropy) and the smoothed max-relative entropy approach the regularized relative entropy between the sets. Notably, the asymptotic limit has explicit convergence guarantees and can be efficiently estimated through convex optimization programs, despite the regularization, provided that the sets have efficient descriptions. The generalized AEP directly implies a new generalized quantum Stein's lemma for conducting quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states. This addresses open questions raised by Brand\~{a}o et al. [IEEE TIT 66(8):5037-5054 (2020)] and Mosonyi et al. [IEEE TIT 68(2):1032-1067 (2022)], which seek a Stein's lemma with computational efficiency. Moreover, we propose a new framework for quantum resource theory in which state transformations are performed without requiring precise characterization of the states being manipulated, making it more robust to imperfections. We demonstrate the reversibility (also referred to as the second law) of such a theory and identify the regularized relative entropy as the unique measure of the resource in this new framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanolasers operating at low power levels are strongly affected by intrinsic quantum noise, influencing both intensity fluctuations and laser coherence. Starting from semiclassical rate equations and making a simple hypothesis for the phase of the laser field, a simple stochastic model for the laser quantum noise is suggested. The model is shown to agree quantitatively with quantum master equations for microscopic lasers with a small number of emitters and with classical Langevin equations for macroscopic systems. In contrast, neither quantum master equations nor classical Langevin equations adequately address the mesoscopic regime. The stochastic approach is used to calculate the linewidth throughout the transition to lasing, where the linewidth changes from being dominated by the particlelike nature of photons below threshold to the wavelike nature above threshold, where it is strongly influenced by index fluctuations enhancing the linewidth.</description>

Abstract: We construct a local decoder for the 2D toric code using ideas from the hierarchical classical cellular automata of Tsirelson and G\'acs. Our decoder is a circuit of strictly local quantum operations preserving a logical state for exponential time in the presence of circuit-level noise without the need for non-local classical computation or communication. Our construction is not translation invariant in spacetime, but can be made time-translation invariant in 3D with stacks of 2D toric codes. This solves the open problem of constructing a local topological quantum memory below four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, an interactive system composed of a V-type atom and a dissipative single-mode cavity is considered and the atomic quantum coherences are investigated under parameters including spontaneously generated interference (SGI), cavity-environment coupling, weak measurement and its reversal, and detuning between the atom and the cavity. The results indicate that, the strong coupling can induce coherence sudden death (CSD) and coherence sudden birth (CSB), and the non-zero SGI parameter only induces CSB but the detuning may avoid CSD and CSB. Moreover, detuning and weak measurement reversal can very effectively protect quantum coherence, while the SGI parameter, weak measurement, and strong coupling can accelerate its attenuation. The SGI parameter, detuning, weak measurement reversal, and strong coupling all promote the generation of coherence, whereas weak measurement alone can suppress it. In particular, the maximal coherent state can be very effectively protected and the coherent state can be prepared if all parameters are selected appropriately. Physical interpretations are also provided for these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersive readout is widely used to perform high-fidelity measurement of superconducting qubits. Much work has been focused on the qubit readout fidelity, which depends on the achievable signal-to-noise ratio and the qubit relaxation time. As groups have pushed to increase readout fidelity by increasing readout photon number, dispersive readout has been shown to strongly affect the post-measurement qubit state. Such effects hinder the effectiveness of quantum error correction, which requires measurements that both have high readout fidelity and are quantum non-demolition (QND). Here, we experimentally investigate non-QND effects in the fluxonium. We map out the state evolution of fluxonium qubits in the presence of resonator photons and observe that these photons induce transitions in the fluxonium both within and outside the qubit subspace. We numerically model our system and find that coupling the fluxonium-resonator system to an external spurious mode is necessary to explain observed non-QND effects.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty, von Neumann Entropy, and Squeezing in a Bipartite State of Two-Level Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a generalized treatment of uncertainties, von Neumann entropy, and squeezing in entangled bipartite pure state of two-level atoms. We observe that when the bipartite state is entangled, though the von Neumann entropy of the composite state is less than those of the subsystems, as first recognized by Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger, but the uncertainty of the composite state is greater than those of the subsystems for certain ranges of the superposing constants of the quantum state. This is in contradiction with the prevailing idea that the greater the entropy, the greater the uncertainty. Hence, for those ranges of the superposing constants of the quantum state, although the entropic inequalities are violated, the subsystems exhibit less disorder than the system as a whole. We also present generalized relationships between the von Neumann entropies of the subsystems and the uncertainty, spin squeezing, and spectroscopic squeezing parameters - used in the context of Ramsey spectroscopy - of the composite state. This provides a generalized operational measure of von Neumann entropy of entangled subsystems of two-level atoms.</description>

      <title>Single-qubit probes for temperature estimation in the presence of collective baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of single-qubit probes for temperature estimation in the presence of collective baths. We consider a system of two qubits, each locally dissipating into its own bath while being coupled to a common bath. In this setup, we investigate different scenarios for temperature estimation of both the common and local baths. First, we explore how the precision of a single-qubit probe for estimating the common bath temperature can be enhanced by collective effects arising from the shared bath itself, particularly when the second qubit is in resonance with the probe. Interestingly, we find that the presence of local baths on each qubit can either jeopardize or, if these baths are sufficiently cold, enhance this precision. Next, we demonstrate a remote temperature sensing scheme in which one qubit acts as a probe to estimate the temperature of a local bath affecting the other qubit, by leveraging their indirect interaction through the common bath. This approach enables remote temperature sensing without directly coupling the probe to the target qubit or its local environment, thereby minimizing potential disturbances and practical challenges. Notably, we show that the collective Lamb shift, induced by the common bath, plays a crucial role in enabling remote temperature sensing by generating qubit-qubit correlations, even in the case of non-interacting qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspired Excited States Calculations for Molecules Based on Contextual Subspace and Symmetry Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired methods for excited-state calculations remain underexplored in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, despite their critical role in photochemistry and material science. Here, we propose a resource-efficient framework that integrates the contextual subspace (CS) method with the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to enable systematic excited-state calculations for molecules while reducing qubit requirements. On the basis of the numerical results, we find that it is unproblematic to utilize this combination in calculating the excited state to reduce qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the implementation of a spin-conserving hardware-efficient ansatz, namely the $\mathcal{N}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z)$ block ansatz, allows exploitation of spin symmetry within the projected subspace, thereby achieving further reductions in computational resource demands. Compared to the commonly used $R_{y}R_{z}$ ansatz, using the $\mathcal{N}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z)$ ansatz can reduce the number of optimization iterations by up to 3 times at a similar circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Universal Neural-Network Decoder for Stabilizer-Based Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computing to practical applications necessitates reliable quantum error correction. Although numerous correction codes have been proposed, the overall correction efficiency critically limited by the decode algorithms. We introduce GraphQEC, a code-agnostic decoder leveraging machine-learning on the graph structure of stabilizer codes with linear time complexity. GraphQEC demonstrates unprecedented accuracy and efficiency across all tested code families, including surface codes, color codes, and quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. For instance, on a distance-12 QLDPC code, GraphQEC achieves a logical error rate of $9.55 \times 10^{-5}$, an 18-fold improvement over the previous best specialized decoder's $1.74 \times 10^{-3}$ under $p=0.005$ physical error rates, while maintaining $157\mu$s/cycle decoding speed. Our approach represents the first universal solution for real-time quantum error correction across arbitrary stabilizer codes.</description>

Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the non-Abelian exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) on a quantum computer. Rather than utilizing MZMs at the boundaries of quantum Ising chains, which are typically represented as nonlocal operators on a quantum computer, using a Kitaev lattice allows us to exploit a local representation of MZMs. We detail the protocol for braiding two and four MZMs in terms of a spin Hamiltonian, i.e. physical qubit Hamiltonian. Projecting this onto a subspace of states, we extract an effective Hamiltonian which drives a non-Abelian Berry's phase. Using several approximations, we construct a set of gates which mimics this accumulation of non-Abelian phase and process this construction on a quantum computer. For two and four MZMs, we realize braiding fidelities of approximately 85% and 47%, respectively</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Optical Responses of a High-Kinetic-Inductance Microwave Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the optical response of a high-kinetic-inductance microwave resonator is crucial for applications ranging from single-photon detection to quantum transduction between microwave and optical domains, which is gaining significant attention for scaling up quantum computers. However, interactions between the pump light and the superconducting resonator often induce unintended resonance frequency shifts and linewidth broadening. In this study, we measure the local optical response of a NbTiN nanowire resonator using a laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system integrated with a dilution refrigerator. The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the resonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system around the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and understanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to the understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that generate unintended phonons in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Numerical instability of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme sensitivity of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has been extensively studied in recent years with well-established theoretical explanations. However, this sensitivity is often overlooked in numerical simulations, leading to unreliable results. In this work, we reexamine Hatano-Nelson and symplectic Hatano-Nelson models studied in previous work [Kawabata \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. X 13, 021007 (2023)], and compare their results with our high-precision calculations. We systematically investigate inaccuracies in physical results arising from numerical instability during diagonalization and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution. We find that these instabilities arise from a large condition number that scales exponentially with system size due to the NHSE, signaling strong non-normality. Strikingly, a reliable spectrum alone is shown to be insufficient for accurate non-Hermitian evolution, while the reliability of wave functions plays a more critical role. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating the condition number to ensure the validity of numerical studies on systems with NHSE, implying that some prior numerical findings in this area may require careful reexamination.</description>

      <title>Semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and partial majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider families of tight upper bounds on the difference $S(\rho)-S(\sigma)$ with the rank/energy constraint imposed on the state $\rho$ which are valid provided that the state $\rho$ partially majorizes the state $\sigma$ and is close to the state $\sigma$ w.r.t. the trace norm.
  The upper bounds within these families depend on the parameter $m$ of partial majorization. The upper bounds corresponding to $m=0$ coincide with the (unconditional) optimal semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy with the rank/energy constraint obtained in [Lett.Math.Phys.,113,121,35] and [arXiv:2410.02686]. State-dependent improvements of these semicontinuity bounds are proposed and analysed numerically.
  The notion of $\varepsilon$-sufficient majorization dimension of the set of states with bounded energy is introduced and analysed.
  Classical versions of the above results formulated in terms of probability distributions and the Shannon entropy are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Liouville's theorem is first-order in time for the phase-space distribution itself, the relativistic mass-shell constraint $p^\mu p_\mu = m^2$ is naively second-order in energy. We argue that it is reasonable to unify both energy branches within a single Hamiltonian by factorizing $(p^2 - m^2)$ in analogy with Dirac's approach in relativistic quantum mechanics. We show the resulting matrix-based Liouville equation remains first order and naturally yields a $4\times4$ matrix-valued probability density function in phase space as a classical analogue of a relativistic spin-half Wigner function. We investigate its classical physics and deformation quantisation.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Quantum Framework for Evaluating Metal-Organic Frameworks in Carbon Capture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials to help mitigate the effects of global warming by selectively absorbing $\text{CO}_{2}$ for direct capture. Accurate quantum chemistry simulations are a useful tool to help select and design optimal MOF structures, replacing costly or impractical experiments or providing chemically inspired features for data-driven approaches such as machine learning. However, applying simulations over large datasets requires efficient simulation methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) which, despite often being accurate, introduces uncontrolled approximations and a lack of systematic improvability. In this work we outline a hierarchical cluster model that includes a recently developed quantum embedding that provides a more systematic approach to efficiently tune accuracy. We apply this workflow to calculate the binding affinity for a small set of MOF structures and $\text{CO}_{2}$ using experimentally measured heat of adsorption as a reference. Since quantum embeddings have also been proposed as a framework to accelerate the utility of quantum hardware, we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of integrating quantum solvers into the workflow outlined in this work.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Floquet Thermalization in one dimensional Rydberg atom array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum systems hold great promise for engineering exotic quantum phases and matter, but are often hindered by thermalization. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a square wave modulated Floquet engineering protocol to steer and study thermalization dynamics in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays. We identify a novel reciprocal Floquet thermalization mechanism, which is triggered when combination of laser detuning and the Rydberg atom interaction and Floquet period are reciprocal pairs. This leads to many-body quantum chaos, evidenced by level spacing distribution and inverse participation ratio. Signatures of the thermalization can be found from stroboscopic evolution of the atom population, which saturates to that of the thermal ensemble state. Critically, the thermalization occurs in the disorder-free regime, with rapid equilibration achieved within the Rydberg lifetime and experimentally accessible initial states. Our study establishes a robust framework for manipulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics in many-body interacting spin systems. This approach opens pathways for exploring thermalization-to-localization transitions and designing effective Hamiltonians, and highlight the unique potential of the Rydberg atom array setting for quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Causal Order Skip Logic with Coherently Conditioned Subroutines and Application to Grover Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indefinite causal order (ICO) allows quantum circuits to coherently superpose the sequence of operations, creating computational possibilities beyond fixed gate ordering. This work introduces the Quantum Skip Gate (QSG), a new unitary circuit primitive that extends ICO to coherently control whether an expensive quantum subroutine is executed, without mid-circuit measurement or loss of coherence. Unlike conventional ICO constructions that superpose gate sequences, the QSG superposes the presence or absence of operations themselves, enabling conditional quantum logic in a fully unitary setting. Demonstrated experimentally in a Grover-style search on IBM quantum hardware (n = 4, k = 3), the QSG reduces costly subroutine calls by 9-25 percent, achieving a 31-61 percent improvement in success-per-oracle efficiency relative to a fixed-order baseline. Noise-model simulations confirm and strengthen these efficiency gains (up to 45 percent) when using an optimized "swap-out" design. These results demonstrate that ICO can provide practical, coherence-preserving resource management, significantly reducing runtime costs and noise accumulation in near-term quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of quantum computing and agentic AI by examining how quantum technologies can enhance the capabilities of autonomous agents, and, conversely, how agentic AI can support the advancement of quantum systems. We analyze both directions of this synergy and present conceptual and technical foundations for future quantum-agentic platforms. Our work introduces a formal definition of quantum agents and outlines potential architectures that integrate quantum computing with agent-based systems. As a proof-of-concept, we develop and evaluate three quantum agent prototypes that demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed framework. Furthermore, we discuss use cases from both perspectives, including quantum-enhanced decision-making, quantum planning and optimization, and AI-driven orchestration of quantum workflows. By bridging these fields, we aim to chart a path toward scalable, intelligent, and adaptive quantum-agentic ecosystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum devices continue to scale, distributed quantum computing emerges as a promising strategy for executing large-scale tasks across modular quantum processors. A central challenge in this paradigm is verifying the correctness of computational outcomes when subcircuits are executed independently following circuit cutting. Here we propose a cross-platform fidelity estimation algorithm tailored for modular architectures. Our method achieves substantial reductions in sample complexity compared to previous approaches designed for single-processor systems. We experimentally implement the protocol on modular superconducting quantum processors with up to 6 qubits to verify the similarity of two 11-qubit GHZ states. Beyond verification, we show that our algorithm enables a federated quantum kernel method that preserves data privacy. As a proof of concept, we apply it to a 5-qubit quantum phase learning task using six 3-qubit modules, successfully extracting phase information with just eight training samples. These results establish a practical path for scalable verification and trustworthy quantum machine learning of modular quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.02626v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The many-body physics at quantum phase transitions shows a subtle interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations, emerging in the low-temperature limit. In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws. We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system. In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum transitions.</description>

      <title>Cold hybrid electrical-optical ion trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in research such as quantum information and quantum chemistry require subtle methods for trapping particles (including ions, neutral atoms, molecules, etc.). Here we propose a hybrid ion trapping method by combining a Paul trap with optical tweezers. The trap combines the advances of the deep-potential feature for the Paul trap and the micromotion-free feature for the optical dipole trap. By modulating the optical-dipole trap synchronously with the radio frequency voltage of the Paul trap, the alternating electrical force in the trap center is fully counteracted, and the micromotion temperature of a cold trapped ion can reach the order of nK while the trap depth is beyond 300K. These features will enable cold collisions between an ion and an atom in the $s$-wave regime and stably trap the produced molecular ion in the cold hybrid system. This will provide a unique platform for probing the interactions between the ions and the surrounding neutral particles and enable the investigation of new reaction pathways and reaction products in the cold regime.</description>

      <title>Microscopic scales and mechanism of quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional superconducting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting ground state in many two-dimensional materials can be created or destroyed through quantum phase transitions (QPTs) controlled by non-thermal parameters such as carrier density or magnetic field. While various mechanisms for these QPTs have been proposed, it remains unclear which, if any, are applicable to a specific two-dimensional superconducting system. Here, we find that a pair-breaking mechanism which suppresses the Cooper pair density gives a unifying description of magnetic-field-driven QPTs in amorphous MoGe, Pb and TaN films, and the high-temperature superconductor La$_{1.92}$Sr$_{0.08}$CuO$_{4}$. This transition occurs within the superconducting subsystem and is masked by the dominant non-critical contribution of normal electrons. The discovery was enabled by the development of a QPT model that goes beyond the conventional determination of the critical exponents and incorporates into the analysis a microscopic length scale characterizing the transitions. We found that in the materials studied, and MoGe nanowires, this scale corresponds to the size of a Cooper pair. The model has also been successfully applied to QPTs in Josephson junction arrays and various non-superconducting materials. The observation that microscopic scales are encoded in the scaled experimental data of QPTs likely extends beyond equilibrium condensed matter physics and may reveal underlying principles of critical phenomena in a wide variety of systems.</description>

      <title>On the success probability of the quantum algorithm for the short DLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eker{\aa} and H{\aa}stad have introduced a variation of Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). Unlike Shor's original algorithm, Eker{\aa}-H{\aa}stad's algorithm solves the short DLP in groups of unknown order. In this work, we prove a lower bound on the probability of Eker{\aa}-H{\aa}stad's algorithm recovering the short logarithm $d$ in a single run. By our bound, the success probability can easily be pushed as high as $1 - 10^{-10}$ for any short $d$. A key to achieving such a high success probability is to efficiently perform a limited search in the classical post-processing by leveraging meet-in-the-middle techniques. Asymptotically, in the limit as the bit length $m$ of $d$ tends to infinity, the success probability tends to one if the limits on the search space are parameterized in $m$. Our results are directly applicable to Diffie-Hellman in safe-prime groups with short exponents, and to RSA via a reduction from the RSA integer factoring problem (IFP) to the short DLP.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization as an alternate to charge ordering in electronic insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</description>

      <title>Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In the context of cooling, the unattainability principle of the third law of thermodynamics asserts that infinite ``resources'' are needed to reach absolute zero. However, the precise identification of relevant resources and how they jointly constrain achievable error remains unclear within the framework of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics. In this work, we introduce the concept of {\it separated states}, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states, and formulate the corresponding thermokinetic cost and error, thereby establishing a unifying framework for a broad class of thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between {\it time}, {\it cost}, and {\it error} for thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau{C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Duality-preserving deformation of 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with exact gapped ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approximation of the Ising Hamiltonian: Exact Ground States and Applications to Fidelity Assessment in Ising Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel analytical approach to solving large-scale Ising problems by reformulating the discrete Ising Hamiltonian into a continuous framework. This transformation enables us to derive exact solutions for a non-trivial class of fully connected Ising models. To validate our method, we conducted numerical experiments comparing our analytical solutions with those obtained from a quantum-inspired Ising algorithm and a quantum Ising machine. The results demonstrate that the quantum-inspired algorithm and brute-force method successfully align with our solutions, while the quantum Ising machine exhibits notable deviations. Our method offers promising avenues for analytically solving diverse Ising problem instances, while the class of Ising problems addressed here provides a robust framework for assessing the fidelity of Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Evolving Hard Maximum Cut Instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range $100\ {\rm Hz} \text{-} 10^8\ {\rm Hz}$, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above $10^7\ {\rm Hz}$.</description>

      <title>Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for dissipatively preparing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) directly on a lattice, avoiding the need for a two-staged preparation procedure currently used in ultracold-atom platforms. Our protocol is based on driving the lattice-subsystem into a non-equilibrium steady state, which we show to exhibit a lattice analog of a true BEC, where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. Furthermore, exploiting a symmetry-based Mpemba effect, we analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free quantum particle in one dimension whose mass profile exhibits jump discontinuities. The corresponding Hamiltonian is realised as a self-adjoint extension of the kinetic energy operator formulated in divergence form, with the extension encoded in the boundary conditions at the mass discontinuity points. For a family of scale-free boundary conditions, we analyse the associated spectral problem. We find that the eigenfunctions exhibit a highly sensitive and erratic dependence on the energy, leading to irregular spectral behaviour. Notably, the system supports infinitely many distinct semiclassical limits, each labeled by a point on a spectral curve embedded in the two-torus. These results demonstrate a rich interplay between discontinuous coefficients, boundary data, and spectral asymptotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Encodings of Polynomial Chaos Expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the expressive power of quantum circuits in approximating high-dimensional, real-valued functions. We focus on countably-parametric holomorphic maps $u:U\to \mathbb{R}$, where the parameter domain is $U=[-1,1]^{\mathbb{N}}$. We establish dimension-independent quantum circuit approximation rates via the best $n$-term truncations of generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions of these parametric maps, demonstrating that these rates depend solely on the summability exponent of the gPC expansion coefficients. The key to our findings is based on the fact that so-called ``$(\boldsymbol{b},\epsilon)$-holomorphic'' functions, where $\boldsymbol{b}\in (0,1]^\mathbb N \cap \ell^p(\mathbb N)$ for some $p\in(0,1)$, permit structured and sparse gPC expansions. Then, $n$-term truncated gPC expansions are known to admit approximation rates of order $n^{-1/p + 1/2}$ in the $L^2$ norm and of order $n^{-1/p + 1}$ in the $L^\infty$ norm. We show the existence of parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) encodings of these $n$-term truncated gPC expansions, and bound PQC depth and width via (i) tensorization of univariate PQCs that encode Cheby\v{s}ev-polynomials in $[-1,1]$ and (ii) linear combination of unitaries (LCU) to build PQC emulations of $n$-term truncated gPC expansions. The results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the use of quantum algorithms in high-dimensional function approximation. As countably-parametric holomorphic maps naturally arise in parametric PDE models and uncertainty quantification (UQ), our results have implications for quantum-enhanced algorithms for a wide range of maps in applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.</description>
