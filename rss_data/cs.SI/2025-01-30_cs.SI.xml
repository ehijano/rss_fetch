      <title>Parsimonious Hawkes Processes for temporal networks modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal networks are characterised by interdependent link events between nodes, forming ordered sequences of links that may represent specific information flows in the system. Nevertheless, representing temporal networks using discrete snapshots in time partially cancels the effect of time-ordered links on each other, while continuous time models, such as Poisson or Hawkes processes, can describe the full influence between all the potential pairs of links at all times. In this paper, we introduce a continuous Hawkes temporal network model which accounts both for a community structure of the aggregate network and a strong heterogeneity in the activity of individual nodes, thus accounting for the presence of highly heterogeneous clusters with isolated high-activity influencer nodes, communities and low-activity nodes. Our model improves the prediction performance of previously available continuous time network models, and obtains a systematic increase in log-likelihood. Characterising the direct interaction between influencer nodes and communities, we can provide a more detailed description of the system that can better outline the sequence of activations in the components of the systems represented by temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Improving community detection via community association strength scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection methods play a central role in understanding complex networks by revealing highly connected subsets of entities. However, most community detection algorithms generate partitions of the nodes, thus (i) forcing every node to be part of a community and (ii) ignoring the possibility that some nodes may be part of multiple communities. In our work, we investigate three simple community association strength (CAS) scores and their usefulness as post-processing tools given some partition of the nodes. We show that these measures can be used to improve node partitions, detect outlier nodes (not part of any community), and help find nodes with multiple community memberships.</description>

      <title>TikTok's recommendations skewed towards Republican content during the 2024 U.S. presidential race</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TikTok is a major force among social media platforms with over a billion monthly active users worldwide and 170 million in the United States. The platform's status as a key news source, particularly among younger demographics, raises concerns about its potential influence on politics in the U.S. and globally. Despite these concerns, there is scant research investigating TikTok's recommendation algorithm for political biases. We fill this gap by conducting 323 independent algorithmic audit experiments testing partisan content recommendations in the lead-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Specifically, we create hundreds of "sock puppet" TikTok accounts in Texas, New York, and Georgia, seeding them with varying partisan content and collecting algorithmic content recommendations for each of them. Collectively, these accounts viewed ~394,000 videos from April 30th to November 11th, 2024, which we label for political and partisan content. Our analysis reveals significant asymmetries in content distribution: Republican-seeded accounts received ~11.8% more party-aligned recommendations compared to their Democratic-seeded counterparts, and Democratic-seeded accounts were exposed to ~7.5% more opposite-party recommendations on average. These asymmetries exist across all three states and persist when accounting for video- and channel-level engagement metrics such as likes, views, shares, comments, and followers, and are driven primarily by negative partisanship content. Our findings provide insights into the inner workings of TikTok's recommendation algorithm during a critical election period, raising fundamental questions about platform neutrality.</description>

      <title>Dilemmas and trade-offs in the diffusion of conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outside ideal settings, conventions are shaped by heterogeneous competing processes that can challenge the emergence of universal norms. This paper identifies three trade-offs challenging the diffusion of conventions and explores each of them empirically using observational behavioral data. The first trade-off (I) concerns the imperatives of social, sequential, and contextual consistency that individuals must balance when choosing between competing conventions. The second trade-off (II) involves the balance between local and global coordination, depending on whether individuals coordinate their behavior via interactions throughout a social network or external factors transcending the network. The third trade-off (III) is the balance between decision optimality (e.g., collective satisfaction) and decision costs when collectives with conflicting preferences choose one convention. We develop a utilitarian account of conventions which we translate into a broadly applicable statistical physics framework for measuring each of these trade-offs. We then apply this framework to a sign convention in physics using textual and network data. Our analysis suggests that the purpose of conventions may exceed coordination, and that multiple infrastructures (including prior cultural traits and social networks) concurrently shape individual preferences towards conventions. Additionally, we confirm the role of seniority in resolving conflicting preferences in collaborations, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.</description>

      <title>Heuristic-Informed Mixture of Experts for Link Prediction in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction algorithms for multilayer networks are in principle required to effectively account for the entire layered structure while capturing the unique contexts offered by each layer. However, many existing approaches excel at predicting specific links in certain layers but struggle with others, as they fail to effectively leverage the diverse information encoded across different network layers. In this paper, we present MoE-ML-LP, the first Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework specifically designed for multilayer link prediction. Building on top of multilayer heuristics for link prediction, MoE-ML-LP synthesizes the decisions taken by diverse experts, resulting in significantly enhanced predictive capabilities. Our extensive experimental evaluation on real-world and synthetic networks demonstrates that MoE-ML-LP consistently outperforms several baselines and competing methods, achieving remarkable improvements of +60% in Mean Reciprocal Rank, +82% in Hits@1, +55% in Hits@5, and +41% in Hits@10. Furthermore, MoE-ML-LP features a modular architecture that enables the seamless integration of newly developed experts without necessitating the re-training of the entire framework, fostering efficiency and scalability to new experts, paving the way for future advancements in link prediction.</description>

      <title>CSEval: Towards Automated, Multi-Dimensional, and Reference-Free Counterspeech Evaluation using Auto-Calibrated LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterspeech has been popular as an effective approach to counter online hate speech, leading to increasing research interest in automated counterspeech generation using language models. However, this field lacks standardised evaluation protocols and robust automated evaluation metrics that align with human judgement. Current automatic evaluation methods, primarily based on similarity metrics, do not effectively capture the complex and independent attributes of counterspeech quality, such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, or argumentative coherence. This has led to an increased dependency on labor-intensive human evaluations to assess automated counter-speech generation methods. To address these challenges, we introduce CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four dimensions: contextual-relevance, aggressiveness, argument-coherence, and suitableness. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), a prompt-based method with auto-calibrated chain-of-thoughts (CoT) for scoring counterspeech using large language models. Our experiments show that ACE outperforms traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore in correlating with human judgement, indicating a significant advancement in automated counterspeech evaluation.</description>

      <title>Percolation and localisation: Sub-leading eigenvalues of the nonbacktracking matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of the nonbacktracking matrix associated to a network is known to contain fundamental information regarding percolation properties of the network. Indeed, the inverse of its leading eigenvalue is often used as an estimate for the percolation threshold. However, for many networks with nonbacktracking centrality localised on a few nodes, such as networks with a core-periphery structure, this spectral approach badly underestimates the threshold. In this work, we study networks that exhibit this localisation effect by looking beyond the leading eigenvalue and searching deeper into the spectrum of the nonbacktracking matrix. We identify that, when localisation is present, the threshold often more closely aligns with the inverse of one of the sub-leading real eigenvalues: the largest real eigenvalue with a "delocalised" corresponding eigenvector. We investigate a core-periphery network model and determine, both theoretically and experimentally, a regime of parameters for which our approach closely approximates the threshold, while the estimate derived using the leading eigenvalue does not. We further present experimental results on large scale real-world networks that showcase the usefulness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility to Unreliable Information Sources: Swift Adoption with Minimal Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation proliferation on social media platforms is a pervasive threat to the integrity of online public discourse. Genuine users, susceptible to others' influence, often unknowingly engage with, endorse, and re-share questionable pieces of information, collectively amplifying the spread of misinformation. In this study, we introduce an empirical framework to investigate users' susceptibility to influence when exposed to unreliable and reliable information sources. Leveraging two datasets on political and public health discussions on Twitter, we analyze the impact of exposure on the adoption of information sources, examining how the reliability of the source modulates this relationship. Our findings provide evidence that increased exposure augments the likelihood of adoption. Users tend to adopt low-credibility sources with fewer exposures than high-credibility sources, a trend that persists even among non-partisan users. Furthermore, the number of exposures needed for adoption varies based on the source credibility, with extreme ends of the spectrum (very high or low credibility) requiring fewer exposures for adoption. Additionally, we reveal that the adoption of information sources often mirrors users' prior exposure to sources with comparable credibility levels. Our research offers critical insights for mitigating the endorsement of misinformation by vulnerable users, offering a framework to study the dynamics of content exposure and adoption on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Modeling the amplification of epidemic spread by individuals exposed to misinformation on social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11351v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how misinformation affects the spread of disease is crucial for public health, especially given recent research indicating that misinformation can increase vaccine hesitancy and discourage vaccine uptake. However, it is difficult to investigate the interaction between misinformation and epidemic outcomes due to the dearth of data-informed holistic epidemic models. Here, we employ an epidemic model that incorporates a large, mobility-informed physical contact network as well as the distribution of misinformed individuals across counties derived from social media data. The model allows us to simulate various scenarios to understand how epidemic spreading can be affected by misinformation spreading through one particular social media platform. Using this model, we compare a worst-case scenario, in which individuals become misinformed after a single exposure to low-credibility content, to a best-case scenario where the population is highly resilient to misinformation. We estimate the additional portion of the U.S. population that would become infected over the course of the COVID-19 epidemic in the worst-case scenario. This work can provide policymakers with insights about the potential harms of exposure to online vaccine misinformation.</description>

      <title>LayerPlexRank: Exploring Node Centrality and Layer Influence through Algebraic Connectivity in Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the calculation of centrality in complex networks becomes increasingly vital across technological, biological, and social systems, precise and scalable ranking methods are essential for understanding these networks. This paper introduces LayerPlexRank, an algorithm that simultaneously assesses node centrality and layer influence in multiplex networks using algebraic connectivity metrics. This method enhances the robustness of the ranking algorithm by effectively assessing structural changes across layers using random walk, considering the overall connectivity of the graph. We substantiate the utility of LayerPlexRank with theoretical analyses and empirical validations on varied real-world datasets, contrasting it with established centrality measures.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Social Influence Maximization via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17736v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups). In the literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics can be misleading since they overlook the stochastic nature of information diffusion processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as ``In 50% of the cases, no one in group 1 gets the information, while everyone in group 2 does, and in the other 50%, it is the opposite'', which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose a new seed-selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness, and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase) in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Optimization of Dynamic Networks for Reduction of Vulnerability Against Adversarial Resonance Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonance is a well-known phenomenon that happens in systems with second order dynamics. In this paper we address the fundamental question of making a network robust to signal being periodically pumped into it at or near a resonant frequency by an adversarial agent with the aim of saturating the network with the signal. Towards this goal, we develop the notion of network vulnerability, which is measured by the expected resonance amplitude on the network under a stochastically modeled adversarial attack. Assuming a second order dynamics model based on the network graph Laplacian matrix and a known stochastic model for the adversarial attack, we propose two methods for minimizing the network vulnerability through optimization of the spectrum of the network graph. We provide extensive numerical results analyzing the effects of both methods.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>
