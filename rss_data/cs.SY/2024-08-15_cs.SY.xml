      <title>Object Tracking Incorporating Transfer Learning into Unscented and Cubature Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel filtering algorithm that employs Bayesian transfer learning to address the challenges posed by mismatched intensity of the noise in a pair of sensors, each of which tracks an object using a nonlinear dynamic system model. In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</description>

      <title>Real-world validation of safe reinforcement learning, model predictive control and decision tree-based home energy management systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning based energy management approaches, specifically reinforcement learning with a safety layer (OptLayerPolicy) and a metaheuristic algorithm generating a decision tree control policy (TreeC), have shown promise. However, their effectiveness has only been demonstrated in computer simulations. This paper presents the real-world validation of these methods, comparing against model predictive control and simple rule-based control benchmark. The experiments were conducted on the electrical installation of 4 reproductions of residential houses, which all have their own battery, photovoltaic and dynamic load system emulating a non-controllable electrical load and a controllable electric vehicle charger. The results show that the simple rules, TreeC, and model predictive control-based methods achieved similar costs, with a difference of only 0.6%. The reinforcement learning based method, still in its training phase, obtained a cost 25.5\% higher to the other methods. Additional simulations show that the costs can be further reduced by using a more representative training dataset for TreeC and addressing errors in the model predictive control implementation caused by its reliance on accurate data from various sources. The OptLayerPolicy safety layer allows safe online training of a reinforcement learning agent in the real-world, given an accurate constraint function formulation. The proposed safety layer method remains error-prone, nonetheless, it is found beneficial for all investigated methods. The TreeC method, which does require building a realistic simulation for training, exhibits the safest operational performance, exceeding the grid limit by only 27.1 Wh compared to 593.9 Wh for reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Remote Tube-based MPC for Tracking Over Lossy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of controlling constrained systems subject to disturbances in the case where controller and system are connected over a lossy network. To do so, we propose a novel framework that splits the concept of tube-based model predictive control into two parts. One runs locally on the system and is responsible for disturbance rejection, while the other runs remotely and provides optimal input trajectories that satisfy the system's state and input constraints. Key to our approach is the presence of a nominal model and an ancillary controller on the local system. Theoretical guarantees regarding the recursive feasibility and the tracking capabilities in the presence of disturbances and packet losses in both directions are provided. To test the efficacy of the proposed approach, we compare it to a state-of-the-art solution in the case of controlling a cartpole system. Extensive simulations are carried out with both linearized and nonlinear system dynamics, as well as different packet loss probabilities and disturbances.

      <title>Designing Laplacian flows for opinion clustering in structurally balanced and unbalanced networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a group of n agents whose interactions can be represented using unsigned or signed structurally balanced graphs or a special case of structurally unbalanced graphs. A Laplacian-based model is proposed to govern the evolution of opinions. The objective of the paper is to analyze the proposed opinion model on the opinion evolution of the agents. Further, we also determine the conditions required to apply the proposed Laplacian-based opinion model. Finally, some numerical results are shown to validate these results.</description>

      <title>Startup Control Optimization of He-Xe Cooled Space Nuclear Reactors Using a System Analysis Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07566v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, achieving autonomous control in nuclear reactor operations has become pivotal for the effectiveness of Space Nuclear Power Systems (SNPS). However, compared to power control, the startup control of SNPS remains underexplored. This study introduces a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at enhancing startup control, leveraging a system level analysis program to simulate the system's dynamic behavior accurately. The primary contribution of this work is the development and implementation of an optimization framework that significantly reduces startup time and improves control efficiency. Utilizing a non-ideal gas model, a multi-channel core model and the Monte Carlo code RMC employed to calculate temperature reactivity coefficients and neutron kinetics parameters, the system analysis tool ensures precise thermal-dynamic simulations. After insightful comprehension of system dynamics through reactive insertion accidents, the optimization algorithm fine-tunes the control sequences for external reactivity insertion, TAC system shaft speed, and cooling system background temperature. The optimized control strategy achieves threshold power 1260 seconds earlier and turbine inlet temperature 1980 seconds sooner than baseline methods. The findings highlight the potential of the proposed optimization framework to enhance the autonomy and operational efficiency of future SNPS designs.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Cascade Operators and their Role in Linear Control, Estimation, and Model Reduction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain linear matrix operators arise naturally in systems analysis and design problems involving cascade interconnections of linear time-invariant systems, including problems of stabilization, estimation, and model order reduction. We conduct here a comprehensive study of these operators and their relevant system-theoretic properties. The general theory is then leveraged to delineate both known and new design methodologies for control, estimation, and model reduction. Several entirely new designs arise from this systematic categorization, including new recursive and low-gain design frameworks for observation of cascaded systems. The benefits of the results beyond the linear time-invariant setting are demonstrated through preliminary extensions for nonlinear systems, with an outlook towards the development of a similarly comprehensive nonlinear theory.</description>

      <title>Microgrid Building Blocks for Dynamic Decoupling and Black Start Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrids offer increased self-reliance and resilience at the grid's edge. They promote a significant transition to decentralized and renewable energy production by optimizing the utilization of local renewable sources. However, to maintain stable operations under all conditions and harness microgrids' full economic and technological potential, it is essential to integrate with the bulk grid and neighboring microgrids seamlessly. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of Back-to-Back (BTB) converters as a pivotal technology for interfacing microgrids, hybrid AC/DC grids, and bulk grids, by leveraging a comprehensive phasor-domain model integrated into GridLAB-D. The phasor-domain model is computationally efficient for simulating BTB with bulk grids and networked microgrids. We showcase the versatility of BTB converters (an integrated Microgrid Building Block) by configuring a two-microgrid network from a modified IEEE 13-node distribution system. These microgrids are equipped with diesel generators, photovoltaic units, and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). The simulation studies are focused on use cases demonstrating dynamic decoupling and controlled support that a microgrid can provide via a BTB converter.</description>

      <title>On linear quadratic regulator for the heat equation with general boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the linear quadratic regulator of the heat equation on a finite interval. Previous frequency-domain methods for this problem rely on discrete Fourier transform and require symmetric boundary conditions. We use the Fokas method to derive the optimal control law for general Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The Fokas method uses the continuous Fourier transform restricted on the bounded spatial domain, with the frequency variable $k$ domain extended from the real line to the complex plane. This extension, together with results from complex analysis, allows us to eliminate the dependence of the optimal control on the unknown boundary values. As a result, we derive an integral representation of the control similar to the inverse Fourier transform. This representation contains integrals along complex contours and only depends on known initial and boundary conditions. We also show that for the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary value problem, the integral representation recovers an existing series representation of the optimal control. Moreover, the integral representation exhibits numerical advantages compared to the traditional series representation.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Control of Water Treatment with Pumped Water Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water treatment facilities are critical infrastructure they must accommodate dynamic demand patterns without system disruption. These patterns can be scheduled, such as daily residential irrigation, or unexpected, such as demand spikes from withdrawals for fire management. The critical necessity of clean, safe, and reliable water requires water treatment control strategies that are insensitive to disturbances to guarantee that demand will be met. One essential problem in achieving this is the minimization of energy costs in the process of meeting water demand, especially as the need for decarbonization persists. This work develops a control-oriented hydraulic model of a water treatment facility with integrated pumped storage and introduces a model predictive control strategy for scheduling treatment plant system operations to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and safely meet water demand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for verifying quantum computers are predominately based on interactive or automatic theorem provers. Considering that quantum computers are dynamical in nature, this paper employs and extends the concepts from the verification of dynamical systems to verify properties of quantum circuits. Our main contribution is to propose k-inductive barrier certificates over complex variables and show how to compute them using Hermitian Sum of Squares optimization. We apply this new technique to verify properties of different quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>SigmaRL: A Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source, decentralized framework named SigmaRL, designed to enhance both sample efficiency and generalization of multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for motion planning of connected and automated vehicles. Most RL agents exhibit a limited capacity to generalize, often focusing narrowly on specific scenarios, and are usually evaluated in similar or even the same scenarios seen during training. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges, including experience replay and regularization. However, how observation design in RL affects sample efficiency and generalization remains an under-explored area. We address this gap by proposing five strategies to design information-dense observations, focusing on general features that are applicable to most traffic scenarios. We train our RL agents using these strategies on an intersection and evaluate their generalization through numerical experiments across completely unseen traffic scenarios, including a new intersection, an on-ramp, and a roundabout. Incorporating these information-dense observations reduces training times to under one hour on a single CPU, and the evaluation results reveal that our RL agents can effectively zero-shot generalize.

      <title>Distance-coupling as an Approach to Position and Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the case of autonomous agents which are required to move to some new position based solely on the distance measured from predetermined reference points, or anchors. A novel approach, referred to as distance-coupling, is proposed for calculating the agent's position exclusively from differences between squared distance measurements. The key insight in our approach is that, in doing so, we cancel out the measurement's quadratic term and obtain a function of position which is linear. We apply this method to the homing problem and prove Lyapunov stability with and without anchor placement error; identifying bounds on the region of attraction when the anchors are linearly transformed from their desired positions. As an application of the method, we show how the policy can be implemented for distributed formation control on a set of autonomous agents, proving the existence of the set of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Real-time Regulation of Detention Ponds via Feedback Control: Balancing Flood Mitigation and Water Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detention ponds can mitigate flooding and improve water quality by allowing the settlement of pollutants. Typically, they are operated with fully open orifices and weirs (i.e., passive control). Active controls can improve the performance of these systems: orifices can be retrofitted with controlled valves and spillways can have controllable gates. The real-time optimal operation of its hydraulic devices can be achieved with techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). A distributed quasi-2D hydrologic-hydrodynamic coupled with a reservoir flood routing model is developed and integrated with an MPC algorithm to estimate the operation of valves and movable gates. The control optimization problem is adapted to switch from a flood-related algorithm focusing on mitigating floods to a heuristic objective function that aims to increase the detention time when no inflow hydrographs are predicted. The case studies show the potential of applying the methods developed in a catchment in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The performance of MPC compared to alternatives with either fully or partially open valves and gates are tested. Comparisons with HEC-RAS 2D indicate volume and peak flow errors of approximately 1.4% and 0.91% for the watershed module. Simulating two consecutive 10-year storms shows that the MPC strategy can achieve peak flow reductions of 79%. In contrast, passive control has nearly half of the performance. A 1-year continuous simulation results show that the passive scenario with 25% of the valves opened can treat 12% more runoff compared to the developed MPC approach, with an average detention time of approximately 6 hours. For the MPC approach, the average detention time is nearly 14 hours indicating that both control techniques can treat similar volumes; however, the proxy water quality for the MPC approach is enhanced due to the longer detention times.</description>

      <title>Resilient source seeking with robot swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a solution for locating the source, or maximum, of an unknown scalar field using a swarm of mobile robots. Unlike relying on the traditional gradient information, the swarm determines an ascending direction to approach the source with arbitrary precision. The ascending direction is calculated from measurements of the field strength at the robot locations and their relative positions concerning the centroid. Rather than focusing on individual robots, we focus the analysis on the density of robots per unit area to guarantee a more resilient swarm, i.e., the functionality remains even if individuals go missing or are misplaced during the mission. We reinforce the robustness of the algorithm by providing sufficient conditions for the swarm shape so that the ascending direction is almost parallel to the gradient. The swarm can respond to an unexpected environment by morphing its shape and exploiting the existence of multiple ascending directions. Finally, we validate our approach numerically with hundreds of robots. The fact that a large number of robots always calculate an ascending direction compensates for the loss of individuals and mitigates issues arising from the actuator and sensor noises.</description>

      <title>Error bounds, PL condition, and quadratic growth for weakly convex functions, and linear convergences of proximal point methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many practical optimization problems lack strong convexity. Fortunately, recent studies have revealed that first-order algorithms also enjoy linear convergences under various weaker regularity conditions. While the relationship among different conditions for convex and smooth functions is well-understood, it is not the case for the nonsmooth setting. In this paper, we go beyond convexity and smoothness, and clarify the connections among common regularity conditions in the class of weakly convex functions, including $\textit{strong convexity}$, $\textit{restricted secant inequality}$, $\textit{subdifferential error bound}$, $\textit{Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality}$, and $\textit{quadratic growth}$. In addition, using these regularity conditions, we present a simple and modular proof for the linear convergence of the proximal point method (PPM) for convex and weakly convex optimization problems. The linear convergence also holds when the subproblems of PPM are solved inexactly with a proper control of inexactness.</description>

      <title>Flight Path Optimization with Optimal Control Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is based on a crucial issue in the aviation world: how to optimize the trajectory and controls given to the aircraft in order to optimize flight time and fuel consumption. This study aims to provide elements of a response to this problem and to define, under certain simplifying assumptions, an optimal response, using Constrained Finite Time Optimal Control(CFTOC). The first step is to define the dynamic model of the aircraft in accordance with the controllable inputs and wind disturbances. Then we will identify a precise objective in terms of optimization and implement an optimization program to solve it under the circumstances of simulated real flight situation. Finally, the optimization result is validated and discussed by different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Physics-Informed Learning for Stochastic Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08868</link>

Abstract: Accurate estimate of long-term risk is critical for safe decision-making, but sampling from rare risk events and long-term trajectories can be prohibitively costly. Risk gradient can be used in many first-order techniques for learning and control methods, but gradient estimate is difficult to obtain using Monte Carlo (MC) methods because the infinitesimal divisor may significantly amplify sampling noise. Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method to evaluate long-term risk probabilities and their gradients using short-term samples without sufficient risk events. We first derive that four types of long-term risk probability are solutions of certain partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, we propose a physics-informed learning technique that integrates data and physics information (aforementioned PDEs). The physics information helps propagate information beyond available data and obtain provable generalization beyond available data, which in turn enables long-term risk to be estimated using short-term samples of safe events. Finally, we demonstrate in simulation that the proposed technique has improved sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, and adapts to changing system parameters.</description>

      <title>System-Level Simulation Framework for NB-IoT: Key Features and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a technology specifically designated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet the explosive demand for massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and it is evolving to RedCap. Industrial companies have increasingly adopted NB-IoT as the solution for mMTC due to its lightweight design and comprehensive technical specifications released by 3GPP. This paper presents a system-level simulation framework for NB-IoT networks to evaluate their performance. The system-level simulator is structured into four parts: initialization, pre-generation, main simulation loop, and post-processing. Additionally, three essential features are investigated to enhance coverage, support massive connections, and ensure low power consumption, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the cumulative distribution function curves of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio fully comply with industrial standards. Furthermore, the throughput performance explains how NB-IoT networks realize massive connections at the cost of data rate. This work highlights its practical utility and paves the way for developing NB-IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Time series forecasting with high stakes: A field study of the air cargo industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20192</link>

Abstract: Time series forecasting in the air cargo industry presents unique challenges due to volatile market dynamics and the significant impact of accurate forecasts on generated revenue. This paper explores a comprehensive approach to demand forecasting at the origin-destination (O\&amp;D) level, focusing on the development and implementation of machine learning models in decision-making for the air cargo industry. We leverage a mixture of experts framework, combining statistical and advanced deep learning models to provide reliable forecasts for cargo demand over a six-month horizon. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms industry benchmarks, offering actionable insights for cargo capacity allocation and strategic decision-making in the air cargo industry. While this work is applied in the airline industry, the methodology is broadly applicable to any field where forecast-based decision-making in a volatile environment is crucial.</description>
