      <title>Finite temperature electric field induced two-dimensional coherent nonlinear spectroscopy in a Kitaev magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electric field induced two-dimensional coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy (2DCS) in a Kitaev magnet at finite temperature. We show that 2DCS is susceptible to both types of fractional quasiparticles of this quantum spin-liquid, i.e., fermions and flux visons. Focusing on the second order response, we find a strong antidiagonal feature in the two-dimensional frequency plane, related to the galvanoelectric effect of the fractional fermions. Perpendicular to the antidiagonal, the width of this feature is set by quasiparticle relaxation rates beyond the bare Kitaev magnet, thereby providing access to single-particle characteristics within the multi-particle 2DCS continuum. While the structure of the 2DCS susceptibility stems from the fermionic quasiparticles and displays Fermi blocking versus temperature, the emergent bond randomness which arises due to thermally populated visons strongly modifies the fermionic spectrum. Therefore also the presence of gauge excitations is manifest in the 2DCS susceptibility as the temperature is increased beyond the flux proliferation crossover. Our results are consistent with and extend previous findings on second harmonic generation in Kitaev magnets.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Spin Exchange Splitting in Graphene Hybrid Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene, with spin and valley degrees of freedom, fosters unexpected physical and chemical properties for the realization of next-generation quantum devices. However, the spin symmetry of graphene is rather robustly protected, hampering manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom for the application of spintronic devices such as electric gate tunable spin filters. We demonstrate that a hybrid heterostructure composed of graphene and LaCoO3 epitaxial thin film exhibits an electrically tunable spin exchange splitting. The large and adjustable spin exchange splitting of 155.9 - 306.5 meV was obtained by the characteristic shifts in both the spin symmetry broken quantum Hall states and the Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations. Strong hybridization induced charge transfer across the hybrid heterointerface has been identified for the observed spin exchange splitting. The substantial and facile controllability of the spin exchange splitting provides an opportunity for spintronics applications with the electrically-tunable spin polarization in hybrid heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Unified description of electronic orderings and cross correlations by complete multipole representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We overview recent developments of electronic orderings and associated cross correlations in condensed matter physics based on a complete set of multipole representations (electric, magnetic, electric toroidal, and magnetic toroidal multipoles) with distinct space-time inversion symmetries. By means of the symmetry-adapted complete basis set in any physical Hilbert space including atomic and cluster degrees of freedom, it provides a unified description of electronic orderings, deformations of band structures, cross correlations, and transport properties in solids. We review that a multipole representation is a powerful tool to attain a comprehensive understanding of various electronic properties and physical phenomena observed in materials. We also demonstrate how to identify active multipoles and expected physical phenomena in real materials with several examples. Our review would serve as a solid foundation for future studies toward observations and identifications of unknown electronic phases and their related physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-time relaxation quantum critical dynamics in two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the Neel-paramagnetic quantum phase transition in the two-dimensional (2D) dimerized S = 1/2 Heisenberg model. We focus on the scaling correction in the short-time region. A unified scaling form including both short-time and finite-size corrections is proposed. According to this full scaling form, improved short-imaginary-time scaling relations are obtained. We numerically verify the scaling form and the improved short-time scaling relations for different initial states using projector quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry Fractionalization and Foliated Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum matter exhibits a range of exotic phenomena when enriched by subdimensional symmetries. This includes new features beyond those that appear in the conventional setting of global symmetry enrichment. A recently discovered example is a type of subsystem symmetry fractionalization that occurs through a different mechanism to global symmetry fractionalization. In this work we extend the study of subsystem symmetry fractionalization through new examples derived from the general principle of embedding subsystem symmetry into higher-form symmetry. This leads to new types of symmetry fractionalization that are described by foliation dependent higher-form symmetries. This leads to field theories and lattice models that support previously unseen anomalous subsystem symmetry fractionalization. Our work expands the range of exotic topological physics that is enabled by subsystem symmetry in field theory and on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Coupled Insulators and Metals on the Verge of Kitaev Spin Liquids in Ilmenite Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competition and cooperation between electron correlation and relativistic spin-orbit coupling give rise to diverse exotic quantum phenomena in solids. An illustrative example is spin-orbit entangled quantum liquids, which exhibit remarkable features such as topological orders and fractional excitations. The Kitaev honeycomb model realizes such interesting states, called the Kitaev spin liquids, but its experimental feasibility is still challenging. Here we theoretically investigate hexagonal heterostructures including a candidate for the Kitaev magnets, MgIrO$_3$, to actively manipulate the electronic and magnetic properties toward realizing the Kitaev spin liquids. For three different structure types of ilmenite bilayers MgIrO$_3$/$A$TiO$_3$ with $A$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, we obtain the optimized lattice structures, the electronic band structures, the stable magnetic orders, and the effective magnetic couplings. We find that the spin-orbital coupled bands characterized by the pseudospin $j_{\rm eff}=$ 1/2 are retained in the MgIrO$_3$ layer for all the heterostructures, but the magnetic state and the band gap depend on the types of heterostructures as well as the $A$ atoms. In particular, one type becomes metallic irrespective of $A$, while the other two are mostly insulating. We show that the insulating cases provide spin-orbit coupled Mott insulating states with dominant Kitaev-type interactions, accompanied by different combinations of subdominant interactions depending on the heterostructural type and $A$, while the metallic cases realize spin-orbit coupled metals with various doping rates. Our results indicate that these hexagonal heterostructures are a good platform for engineering electronic and magnetic properties of the spin-orbital coupled correlated materials, including the possibility of Majorana Fermi surfaces and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Stoner ferromagnetism, correlated metal and thermoelectricity in partially flat-band materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discovery of correlated electronic phases in twisted heterostructures raised a surge of interests in studying models and materials with flat bands where the electronic excitations are nearly dispersionless in momentum space. As such, the kinetic energy is quenched and the correlations are enhanced, giving rise to a plethora of unusual magnetic, superconducting and transport behaviors. Finding materials whose energy bands are completely flat is rather challenging, yet those whose dispersion is flat only in a portion of the momentum space might be more accessible in material search. In this work, we propose a partially flat-band system on a square lattice. Using the Hubbard model, it is demonstrated that the suppression of the electronic kinetic energy in the flat portion of the band dispersion drives the system to Stoner ferromagnetism even at very weak interactions, i.e., much smaller than the bandwidth, with significantly enhanced Curie temperature. While the low-energy magnon modes are well defined collective excitations, flat magnon bands can be observed at high energies. We show that the strong interaction leads to reduction of the flat portion of the magnon band. However, tuning the chemical potential at a strong interaction regime may lead to spin density wave at finite wave vectors. Then, focusing on the non-magnetic correlated phase and using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate the appearance of a flat-band induced sharp peak in the density of states in addition to the correlation-induced Mott bands. Furthermore, the large seebeck coefficient and the figure of merit of the proposed partially flat-band model, compared to symmetric regular band models, put them in the category of efficient thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Compactness of quantics tensor train representations of local imaginary-time propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time dependence of imaginary-time propagators, vital for \textit{ab initio} and many-body calculations based on quantum field theories, has been revealed to be compressible using Quantum Tensor Trains (QTTs) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021015 (2023)]. However, the impact of system parameters, like temperature, on data size remains underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive numerical analysis of the compactness of local imaginary-time propagators in QTT for one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency objects, considering truncation in terms of the Frobenius and maximum norms. We employ random pole models to study worst-case scenarios. The numerical analysis reveals several key findings. For one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency objects, the bond dimensions saturate at low temperatures, especially for truncation in terms of the Frobenius norm. We provide counting-number arguments for the saturation of bond dimensions for the one-time/-frequency objects, while the origin of this saturation for two-time/-frequency objects remains to be clarified. This paper's findings highlight the critical need for further research on the selection of truncation methods, tolerance levels, and the choice between imaginary-time and imaginary-frequency representations in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport properties in van-der-Waals \textit{\textbf{R}}Te$_{3}$ (\textit{\textbf{R}} = La, Ce, Tb)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth tritellurides are van-der-Waals antiferromagnets which have been attracting attention as materials not onlywith high mobility, but also with various states such as superconductivity under high pressure, incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) phase, andmultiple antiferromagnetic phases.In this work, we performed longitudinal resistivity and Hall resistivity measurements simultaneously in exfoliated $R$Te$_3$ ($R=$La, Ce, Tb) thin film devices,in order to investigate the influence of magnetic ordering on transport properties in van-der-Waals magnetic materials.We have obtained carrier mobility and concentration using a two-band model, and have observed an increase in carrier mobility in the antiferromagnets CeTe$_3$ and TbTe$_3$ due to the magnetic transition.Especially in CeTe$_3$, the carrier concentration has changed drastically below the magnetic transition temperature,suggesting the interaction between the CDW and antiferromagnetic phases.In addition, the analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in CeTe$_3$ supports the possibility of Fermi surface modulation by magnetic ordering.This research will pave the way not only for spintronic devicesthat take advantage of high mobility, but also for the study of the correlation between CDW and magnetism states in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum oscillations near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in CaAs3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit sets the lower bound of carrier mean free path for coherent quasiparticle transport. Metallicity beyond this limit is of great interest because it is often closely related to quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity. Progress along this direction mainly focuses on the strange-metal behaviors originating from the evolution of quasiparticle scattering rate such as linear-in-temperature resistivity, while the quasiparticle coherence phenomena in this regime are much less explored due to the short mean free path at the diffusive bound. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations from Landau quantization near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in CaAs3. Despite the insulator-like temperature dependence of resistivity, CaAs3 presents giant magnetoresistance and prominent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations from Fermi surfaces, indicating highly coherent band transport. In contrast, the quantum oscillation is absent in the magnetic torque. The quasiparticle effective mass increases systematically with magnetic fields, manifesting a much larger value than the expectation given by magneto-infrared spectroscopy. It suggests a strong many-body renormalization effect near Fermi surface. We find that these unconventional behaviors may be explained by the interplay between the mobility edge and the van Hove singularity, which results in the formation of coherent cyclotron orbits emerging at the diffusive bound. Our results call for further study on the electron correlation effect of the van Hove singularity.</description>

      <title>Duality and hidden symmetry breaking in the q-deformed Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the question of string order and hidden symmetry breaking in the q-deformed AKLT model, an example of a spin chain that possesses generalized symmetry. We first argue that the non-local Kennedy-Tasaki duality transformation that was previously proposed to relate the string order to a local order parameter leads to a non-local Hamiltonian and thus does not provide a physically adequate description of the symmetry breaking. We then present a modified non-local transformation which is based on a recently developed generalization of Witten's Conjugation to frustration-free lattice models and capable of resolving this issue.</description>

      <title>Inelastic neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation investigations of the deuterated Kondo lattices CeNiSnD$ _x $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeNiSn is a Kondo semimetal where a gap opens at low temperatures due to hybridization between 4$f$ and conduction electrons, but a full insulating state fails to develop. Upon the insertion of hydrogen, long range magnetic order is induced. Here we report zero-field muon-spin relaxation and inelastic neutron scattering measurements of polycrystalline samples of the deuterides CeNiSnD$_x$ ($x$=1.0, 1.8). The muon-spin relaxation results confirm magnetic ordering in the whole sample of CeNiSnD below around 4.7 K, while inelastic neutron scattering reveals two well-defined crystalline-electric field (CEF) excitations at around 13 meV and 34 meV in CeNiSnD, and 5 meV and 27 meV for CeNiSnD$_{1.8}$. These results suggest that hydrogenation leads to the localization of the Ce-4$f$ electrons, giving rise to long-range magnetic order. We propose CEF level schemes for both systems, which predict a ground state moment of 0.96$\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce within the $ab$-plane for CeNiSnD$_{1.8}$ and a saturated moment of 1.26$\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce along the easy $c$ axis for CeNiSnD, that account for the observed magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Field-orientation-dependent magnetic phases in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ probed with muon-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrosymmetric GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ exhibits a variety of multi-Q magnetic states as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field, including a square skyrmion-lattice phase. The material's behavior is strongly dependent on the direction of the applied field, with different phase diagrams resulting for fields applied parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$ axis. Here, we present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) measurements on single crystals of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our analysis is based on the computation of muon stopping sites and consideration of zero-point motion effects, allowing direct comparison with the underlying spin textures in the material. Using transverse-field $\mu^+$SR with fields applied along either the [001] or [100] crystallographic directions, we distinguish between the magnetic phases in this system via their distinct muon response, providing additional evidence for the skyrmion and meron-lattice phases, while also suggesting the existence of RKKY-driven muon hyperfine coupling. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR provides clear evidence for a transition between two distinct magnetically-ordered phases at 39 K.</description>

      <title>Exact matrix product state representations for a type of scale-invariant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact matrix product state representations for a type of scale-invariant states are presented, which describe highly degenerate ground states arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes in one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. As a possible application, such a representation offers a convenient but powerful means for evaluating the norms of highly degenerate ground states. This in turn allows us to perform a universal finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Moreover, this approach vividly explains why the entanglement entropy does not depend on what types of the boundary conditions are adopted, either periodic boundary conditions or open boundary conditions. Illustrative examples include the ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$s$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic model, the ${\rm SU}(2s+1)$ ferromagnetic model, and the staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Although the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring about a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. In addition, we propose a physical model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Particle-Soliton Degeneracies from Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-invertible topological symmetry operators in massive quantum field theories in (1+1) dimensions. In phases where this symmetry is spontaneously broken we show that the particle spectrum often has degeneracies dictated by the non-invertible symmetry and we deduce a procedure to determine the allowed multiplets. These degeneracies are robust predictions and do not require integrability or other special features of renormalization group flows. We exhibit these conclusions in examples where the spectrum is known, recovering soliton and particle degeneracies. For instance, the Tricritical Ising model deformed by the subleading Z2 odd operator flows to a gapped phase with two degenerate vacua. This flow enjoys a Fibonacci fusion category symmetry which implies a threefold degeneracy of its particle states, relating the mass of solitons interpolating between vacua and particles supported in a single vacuum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in $2+1$D~Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, high-energy eigenstates that evade the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, has been established across different quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2 Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated Link Models, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Exact theory of the finite-temperature spectral function of Fermi polarons with multiple particle-hole excitations: Diagrammatic theory versus Chevy ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using both diagrammatic theory and Chevy ansatz approach, we derive an exact set of equations, which determines the spectral function of Fermi polarons with multiple particle-hole excitations at nonzero temperature. In the diagrammatic theory, we find out the complete series of Feynman diagrams for the multi-particle vertex functions, when the unregularized contact interaction strength becomes infinitesimal, a typical situation occurring in two- or three- dimensional free space. The latter Chevy ansatz approach is more widely applicable, allowing a nonzero interaction strength. We clarify the equivalence of the two approaches for an infinitesimal interaction strength and show that the variational coefficients in the Chevy ansatz are precisely the on-shell multi-particle vertex functions divided by an excitation energy. Truncated to a particular order of particle-hole excitations, our exact set of equations can be used to numerically calculate the finite-temperature polaron spectral function, once the numerical singularities in the equations are appropriately treated. As a concrete example, we calculate the finite-temperature spectral function of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional lattices, taking into account all the two-particle-hole excitations. We show that the inclusion of two-particle-hole excitations quantitatively improve the predictions on the polaron spectral function. Our results provide a useful way to solve the challenge problem of accurately predicting the finite-temperature spectral function of Fermi polarons in three-dimensional free space. In addition, our clarification of the complete set of Feynman diagrams for the multi-particle polaron vertex functions may inspire the development of more accurate diagrammatic theories of population-imbalanced strongly interacting Fermi gases, beyond the conventional many-body $T$-matrix approximation.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e., spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Spin Injection Beyond Regular Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible via conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical spin injection} (OSI) beyond the regular Weyl semimetal (WSM), specifically in multi- and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OSI in multi-WSMs can emerge as a frequency-independent quantized response engendered by band linearity and topological charge associated with the node. Interestingly, the frequency independence can be destroyed by going beyond the first-order topological phase. We show that the OSI response is accompanied by peaks for the first-order Weyl nodes while dips for the second-order Weyl nodes. In addition, we elucidate the behavior of OSI in type-II Weyl phases. The predicted signatures of OSI beyond the regular WSM, i.e., multi- and higher-order WSM, could be experimentally exploited, leading us to effectively access as well as distinguish different-order nontrivial Weyl topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bad metallic phase with resistivity above the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, which appears also in cuprate superconductors, was recently understood by cold atom and computer simulations of the Hubbard model via charge susceptibility and charge diffusion constant. However, since reliable simulations can be typically done only at temperatures above the experimental temperatures, the question for cuprate superconductors is still open. This paper addresses this question by resorting to heat transport, which allows for the estimate of electronic diffusion and it further combines it with the resistivity to estimate the charge susceptibility. The doping and temperature dependencies of diffusion constant and charge susceptibilities are shown and discussed for two samples of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. Results indicate strongly incoherent transport, mean free path corresponding to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit for the underdoped sample at temperatures above ~200 K and significant effect of the charge susceptibility on the resistivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: ($i$) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; ($ii$) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Instabilities in the Random-Field XXZ Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite enormous efforts devoted to the study of the many-body localization (MBL) phenomenon, the nature of the high-energy behavior of the Heisenberg spin chain in a strong random magnetic field is lacking consensus. Here, we take a step back by exploring the weak interaction limit starting from the Anderson localized (AL) insulator. Through shift-invert diagonalization, we find that below a certain disorder threshold $h^*$, weak interactions necessarily lead to ergodic instability, whereas at strong disorder the AL insulator directly turns into MBL. This agrees with a simple interpretation of the avalanche theory for restoration of ergodicity. We further map the phase diagram for the generic XXZ model in the disorder $h$ -- interaction $\Delta$ plane. Taking advantage of the total magnetization conservation, our results unveil the remarkable behavior of the spin-spin correlation functions: in the regime indicated as MBL by standard observables, their exponential decay undergoes a unique inversion of orientation $\xi_z&gt;\xi_x$. We find that the longitudinal length $\xi_z$ is a key quantity for capturing ergodic instabilities, as it increases with system size near the thermal phase, in sharp contrast to its transverse counterpart $\xi_x$.</description>

      <title>On spontaneous breaking of the $\text{SO}(2N)$ symmetry in the Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical Gross-Neveu model for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in $2+1$ dimensions suffers a continuous phase transition at a critical interaction $g_{c1} \sim 1/N$ at large $N$, at which its continuous symmetry $\text{SO}(2N)$ is preserved and a discrete (Ising) symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. A recent mean-field calculation, however, points to an additional transition at a diffferent critical $g_{c2}\sim -N g_{c1}$, at which $\text{SO}(2N) \rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$. To study the latter phase transition we rewrite the Gross-Neveu interaction $g (\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ in terms of three different quartic terms for the single ($L=1$) $4N$-component real (Majorana) fermion, and then extend the theory to $L&gt;1$. This allows us to track the evolution of the fixed points of the renormalization group transformation starting from $L\gg 1$, where one can discern three distinct critical points which correspond to continuous phase transitions into (1) $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet mass-order-parameter, (2) $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor mass-order-parameters, and (3) $\text{SO}(2N)$-adjoint nematic-order-parameters, down to $L=1$ value that is relevant to standard Gross-Neveu model. Below the critical value of $L_c (N)\approx 0.35 N$ for $N\gg1$ only the Gross-Neveu critical point (1) still implies a diverging susceptibility for its corresponding ($\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet) order parameter, whereas the two new critical points that existed at large $L$ ultimately become equivalent to the Gaussian fixed point at $L=1$. We interpret this metamorphosis of the $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor fixed point from critical to spurious as an indication that the transition at $g_{c2}$ in the original Gross-Neveu model is turned first-order by fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic anisotropies often originate from the spin-orbit coupling and determine magnetic ordering patterns. We develop a microscopic theory for DC electric-field controls of magnetic anisotropies in magnetic Mott insulators and discuss its applications to Kitaev materials and topological spin textures. Throughout this paper, we take a microscopic approach based on Hubbard-like lattice models, tight-binding models with on-site interactions. We derive a low-energy spin Hamiltonian from a fourth-order perturbation expansion of the Hubbard-like model. We show in the presence of a strong intra-atomic spin-orbit coupling that DC electric fields add non-Kitaev interactions such as a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and an off-diagonal $\Gamma'$ interaction to the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and can induce a topological quantum phase transition between Majorana Chern insulating phases. We also investigate the inter-atomic Rashba spin-orbit coupling and its effects on topological spin textures. DC electric fields turn out to create and annihilate magnetic skyrmions, hedgehogs, and chiral solitons. We propose several methods of creating topological spin textures with external electromagnetic fields. Our theory clarifies that the strong but feasible electric field can control Kitaev spin liquids and topological spin textures.</description>

Abstract: The ground states of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at chiral and flat-band limit with integer fillings are known from exact solutions, while their dynamical and thermodynamical properties are revealed by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. However, to elucidate experimental observations of correlated metallic, insulating and superconducting states and their transitions, investigations on realistic, or non-chiral cases are vital. Here we employ momentum-space QMC method to investigate the evolution of correlated states in magic-angle TBG away from chiral limit at charge neutrality with polarized spin/valley, which approximates to an experimental case with filling factor $\nu=-3$. We find that the ground state evolves from quantum anomalous Hall insulator into an intriguing correlated semimetallic state possessing heavy-fermion features as AA hopping strength reaches experimental values. Such a state resembles the recently proposed heavy-fermion representations with localized electrons residing at AA stacking regions and delocalized electrons itinerating via AB/BA stacking regions. The spectral signatures of the localized and itinerant electrons in the heavy-fermion semimetal phase are revealed, with the connection to experimental results being discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly correlated spin systems can be driven to quantum critical points via various routes. In particular, gapped quantum antiferromagnets can undergo phase transitions into a magnetically ordered state with applied pressure or magnetic field, acting as tuning parameters. These transitions are characterized by $z=1$ or $z=2$ dynamical critical exponents, determined by the linear and quadratic low-energy dispersion of spin excitations, respectively. Employing high-frequency susceptibility and ultrasound techniques, we demonstrate that the tetragonal easy-plane quantum antiferromagnet NiCl$_{2}\cdot$4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ (aka DTN) undergoes a spin-gap closure transition at about $4.2$ kbar, resulting in a pressure-induced magnetic ordering. The studies are complemented by high-pressure-electron spin-resonance measurements confirming the proposed scenario. Powder neutron diffraction measurements revealed that no lattice distortion occurs at this pressure and the high spin symmetry is preserved, establishing DTN as a perfect platform to investigate $z=1$ quantum critical phenomena. The experimental observations are supported by DMRG calculations, allowing us to quantitatively describe the pressure-driven evolution of critical fields and spin-Hamiltonian parameters in DTN.</description>

      <title>Absence of Spin Liquid Phase in the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the Square Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth investigation of the phase diagram of the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We take advantage of Density Matrix Renormalization Group and Fully-Augmented Matrix Product States methods and reach unprecedented accuracy with large bond dimensions. We utilize excited-level crossing analysis to pinpoint the phase transition points. It was believed before that there exists a narrow spin liquid phase sandwiched by the N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM) and valence bond solid (VBS) phases. Through careful finite size scaling of the level crossing points, we find a direct phase transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$, suggesting the absence of an intermediate spin liquid phase. We also provide accurate results for ground state energies for a variety of sizes, from which we find the transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases is continuous. These results indicate the existence of a deconfined quantum critical point at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$ in the model. From the crossing of the first derivative of the energies with $J_2$ for different sizes, we also determine the precise location of the first order phase transition between the VBS and stripe AFM phases at $J_2/J_1=0.610(5)$.</description>

      <title>ComDMFT v.2.0: Fully Self-Consistent ab initio GW+EDMFT for the Electronic Structure of Correlated Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ComDMFT is a parallel computational package designed to study the electronic structure of correlated quantum materials from first principles. Our approach is based on the combination of first-principles methods and dynamical mean field theories. In version 2.0, we implemented fully-diagrammatic GW+EDMFT from first-principles. In this approach, correlated electrons are treated within full GW+EDMFT and the rest are treated within full-GW, seamlessly. This implementation enables the electronic structure calculation of quantum materials with weak, intermediate, and strong electron correlation without prior knowledge of the degree of electron correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic structures and spin excitations are studied across the phase diagram of the geometrically frustrated S = 3/2 quantum antiferromagnet Cs2CoBr4 in magnetic fields applied along the magnetic easy axis, using neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and THz absorption spectroscopy. The data are analyzed, where appropriate, using extended SU (4) linear spin wave theory. A minimal magnetic Hamiltonian is proposed based on measurements in the high field polarized state. It deviates considerably from the previously considered models. Additional dilatometry experiments highlight the importance of magnetoelastic coupling in this system.</description>

      <title>Structural transition and uranium valence change in UTe$_2$ at high pressure revealed by x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High pressure x-ray diffraction up to 30 GPa and resonant emission x-ray spectroscopy and partial fluorescence yield x-ray absorption spectroscopy up to 52 GPa were used to study how the structural and electronic properties of UTe$_2$ evolve with pressure at room temperature. An orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition was observed to occur between 5 and 7 GPa, with a large volume collapse of nearly 11% and a nearest U-U distance increase by about 4%. This lower to higher symmetry transition suggests less 5f electron participation in bonding when the weakly correlated superconducting phase in the tetragonal structure of UTe$_2$ appears. Beyond 7 GPa, no new structural transitions were found up to 30 GPa. The resonant x-ray emission spectra clearly demonstrate an intermediate valence of U, nearly +3.74 at 1.8 GPa and room temperature, and reveal that the U valence shifts towards 4+, passes through a peak at 2.8 GPa, and then decreases towards 3+ and settles down to a nearly constant value above 15 GPa. These experiments reveal that some fundamental structural and valence changes occur in UTe2 at relatively low pressures, which could be responsible for the interplay between unconventional superconductivity, magnetic ordering, and weakly correlated superconductivity that is manifested in the temperature-pressure phase diagram of UTe2.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin fluctuations and long-range interactions in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has been extensively explored both theoretically and experimentally as a suitable platform for a rich and tunable phase diagram that includes ferromagnetism, charge order, broken symmetries, and unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the intricate interplay between long-range electron-electron interactions, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity in MATBG. By employing a low-energy model for MATBG that captures the correct shape of the flat bands, we explore the effects of short- and long-range interactions on spin fluctuations and their impact on the superconducting (SC) pairing vertex in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). We find that the SC state is notably influenced by the strength of long-range Coulomb interactions. Interestingly, our RPA calculations indicate that there is a regime where the system can traverse from a magnetic phase to the SC phase by \emph{increasing} the relative strength of long-range interactions compared to the on-site ones. These findings underscore the relevance of electron-electron interactions in shaping the intriguing properties of MATBG and offer a pathway for designing and controlling its SC phase.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus in finite local-depth circuits with long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians. On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local 2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training using the generalized toric code model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hofstadter model successfully describes the behavior of non-interacting quantum particles hopping on a lattice coupled to a gauge field, and hence is ubiquitous in many fields of research, including condensed matter, optical, and atomic physics. Motivated by this, we introduce HofstadterTools (https://hofstadter.tools), a Python package that can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a generalized Hofstadter model, with any combination of hoppings on any regular Euclidean lattice. The package can be applied to compute key properties of the band structure, such as quantum geometry and topology, as well as plot Hofstadter butterflies and Wannier diagrams that are colored according to their Chern numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate how chiral fermions with an exact gauge symmetry can appear on the d-dimensional boundary of a finite volume (d+1)-dimensional manifold, without any light mirror partners. The condition for the d-dimensional boundary theory to be local is that gauge anomalies cancel and that the volume be large. This can likely be achieved on a lattice and provides a new paradigm for the lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Weyl fermions on a finite lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of unpaired Weyl fermions appearing on the sole 2n-dimensional boundary of a (2n+1)-dimensional manifold with massive Dirac fermions was recently analyzed in a companion paper by one of the authors. In this Letter we show that similar unpaired Weyl edge states can be seen on a finite lattice. In particular, we consider the discretized Hamiltonian for a Wilson fermion in (2+1) dimensions with a 1+1 dimensional boundary and continuous time. We demonstrate that the low lying boundary spectrum is indeed Weyl-like: it has a linear dispersion relation and definite chirality and circulates in only one direction around the boundary. We comment on how our results are consistent with Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. This work removes one potential obstacle facing the program for regulating chiral gauge theories recently proposed by one of the authors.</description>

      <title>Delocalization in a partially disordered interacting many-body system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a partially disordered one-dimensional system with interacting particles. Concretely, we impose a disorder potential to only every other site, followed by a clean site. Our numerical analysis of eigenstate properties is based on the entanglement entropy and density distributions. Most importantly, at large disorder, there exist eigenstates with large entanglement entropies and significant correlations between the clean sites. These states have volume-law scaling, embedded into a sea of area-law states, reminiscent of inverted quantum-scar states. These eigenstate features leave fingerprints in the nonequilibrium dynamics even in the large-disorder regime, with a strong initial-state dependence. We demonstrate that certain types of initial charge-density-wave states decay significantly, while others preserve their initial inhomogeneity, the latter being the typical behavior for many-body localized systems. This initial-condition dependent dynamics may give extra control over the delocalization dynamics at large disorder strength and should be experimentally feasible with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an Excitonic Insulator State in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitonic insulator (EI) is an exotic ground state of narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals arising from spontaneous condensation of electron-hole pairs bound by attractive Coulomb interaction. Despite research on EIs dating back to half a century ago, their existence in real materials remains a subject of ongoing debate. In this study, through systematic experimental and theoretical investigations, we provide evidence for the existence of an EI ground state in a van der Waals compound Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$. Density-functional-theory calculations suggest that it is a semimetal with a small band overlap, whereas various experiments exhibit an insulating ground state with a clear band gap. Upon incorporating electron-hole Coulomb interaction into our calculations, we obtain an EI phase where the electronic symmetry breaking opens a many-body gap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements exhibit that the band gap is closed with a significant change in the dispersions as the number of thermally excited charge carriers becomes sufficiently large in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium states. Structural measurements reveal a slight breaking of crystal symmetry with exceptionally small lattice distortion in the insulating state, which cannot account for the significant gap opening. Therefore, we attribute the insulating ground state with a gap opening in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ to exciton condensation, where the coupling to the symmetry-breaking electronic state induces a subtle change in the crystal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time implementation of interacting many-body systems on present day quantum processors.</description>
