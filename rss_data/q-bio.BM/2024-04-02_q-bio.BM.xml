      <title>Molecular Generative Adversarial Network with Multi-Property Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been employed for $de~novo$ molecular generation in drug discovery. Most prior studies have utilized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, particularly Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), to handle the discrete nature of molecular representations in GANs. However, due to the inherent instability in training GANs and RL models, along with the high computational cost associated with MCTS sampling, MCTS RL-based GANs struggle to scale to large chemical databases. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel GAN based on actor-critic RL with instant and global rewards, called InstGAN, to generate molecules at the token-level with multi-property optimization. Furthermore, maximized information entropy is leveraged to alleviate the mode collapse. The experimental results demonstrate that InstGAN outperforms other baselines, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, and efficiently generates molecules with multi-property optimization. The source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Deep Geometry Handling and Fragment-wise Molecular 3D Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most earlier 3D structure-based molecular generation approaches follow an atom-wise paradigm, incrementally adding atoms to a partially built molecular fragment within protein pockets. These methods, while effective in designing tightly bound ligands, often overlook other essential properties such as synthesizability. The fragment-wise generation paradigm offers a promising solution. However, a common challenge across both atom-wise and fragment-wise methods lies in their limited ability to co-design plausible chemical and geometrical structures, resulting in distorted conformations. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Deep Geometry Handling protocol, a more abstract design that extends the design focus beyond the model architecture. Through a comprehensive review of existing geometry-related models and their protocols, we propose a novel hybrid strategy, culminating in the development of FragGen - a geometry-reliable, fragment-wise molecular generation method. FragGen marks a significant leap forward in the quality of generated geometry and the synthesis accessibility of molecules. The efficacy of FragGen is further validated by its successful application in designing type II kinase inhibitors at the nanomolar level.</description>

      <title>Microbial assessment in a rare Norwegian book collection: a One Health approach to cultural heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbial contamination poses a threat to both the preservation of library and archival collections and the health of staff and users. This study investigated the microbial communities and potential health risks associated with the UNESCO-classified Norwegian Sea Trade Archive (NSTA) collection exhibiting visible microbial colonization and staff health concerns. Dust samples from book surfaces and the storage environment were analysed using culturing methods, qPCR, Next Generation Sequencing, and mycotoxin, cytotoxicity and azole resistance assays. Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., and Cladosporium sp. were the most common fungi identified, with some potentially toxic species like Stachybotrys sp., Toxicladosporium sp. and Aspergillus section Fumigati. Fungal resistance to azoles was not detected. Only one mycotoxin, sterigmatocystin, was found in a heavily contaminated book. Dust extracts from books exhibited moderate to high cytotoxicity on human lung cells, suggesting a potential respiratory risk. The collection had higher contamination levels compared to the storage environment, likely due to improved storage conditions. Even though, overall low contamination levels were obtained, which might be underestimated due to the presence of salt (from cod preservation) that could have interfered with the analyses. This study underlines the importance of monitoring microbial communities and implementing proper storage measures to safeguard cultural heritage and staff well-being.</description>

      <title>Clustering for Protein Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein representation learning is a challenging task that aims to capture the structure and function of proteins from their amino acid sequences. Previous methods largely ignored the fact that not all amino acids are equally important for protein folding and activity. In this article, we propose a neural clustering framework that can automatically discover the critical components of a protein by considering both its primary and tertiary structure information. Our framework treats a protein as a graph, where each node represents an amino acid and each edge represents a spatial or sequential connection between amino acids. We then apply an iterative clustering strategy to group the nodes into clusters based on their 1D and 3D positions and assign scores to each cluster. We select the highest-scoring clusters and use their medoid nodes for the next iteration of clustering, until we obtain a hierarchical and informative representation of the protein. We evaluate on four protein-related tasks: protein fold classification, enzyme reaction classification, gene ontology term prediction, and enzyme commission number prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Driven Domain Adaptation for Generating 3D Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we train a molecule generator that can generate 3D molecules from a new domain, circumventing the need to collect data? This problem can be cast as the problem of domain adaptive molecule generation. This work presents a novel and principled diffusion-based approach, called GADM, that allows shifting a generative model to desired new domains without the need to collect even a single molecule. As the domain shift is typically caused by the structure variations of molecules, e.g., scaffold variations, we leverage a designated equivariant masked autoencoder (MAE) along with various masking strategies to capture the structural-grained representations of the in-domain varieties. In particular, with an asymmetric encoder-decoder module, the MAE can generalize to unseen structure variations from the target domains. These structure variations are encoded with an equivariant encoder and treated as domain supervisors to control denoising. We show that, with these encoded structural-grained domain supervisors, GADM can generate effective molecules within the desired new domains. We conduct extensive experiments across various domain adaptation tasks over benchmarking datasets. We show that our approach can improve up to 65.6% in terms of success rate defined based on molecular validity, uniqueness, and novelty compared to alternative baselines.</description>

      <title>FABind+: Enhancing Molecular Docking through Improved Pocket Prediction and Pose Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a pivotal process in drug discovery. While traditional techniques rely on extensive sampling and simulation governed by physical principles, these methods are often slow and costly. The advent of deep learning-based approaches has shown significant promise, offering increases in both accuracy and efficiency. Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a model designed with a focus on speed and accuracy, we present FABind+, an enhanced iteration that largely boosts the performance of its predecessor. We identify pocket prediction as a critical bottleneck in molecular docking and propose a novel methodology that significantly refines pocket prediction, thereby streamlining the docking process. Furthermore, we introduce modifications to the docking module to enhance its pose generation capabilities. In an effort to bridge the gap with conventional sampling/generative methods, we incorporate a simple yet effective sampling technique coupled with a confidence model, requiring only minor adjustments to the regression framework of FABind. Experimental results and analysis reveal that FABind+ remarkably outperforms the original FABind, achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance, and delivers insightful modeling strategies. This demonstrates FABind+ represents a substantial step forward in molecular docking and drug discovery. Our code is in https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind.</description>

      <title>gRNAde: Geometric Deep Learning for 3D RNA inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational RNA design tasks are often posed as inverse problems, where sequences are designed based on adopting a single desired secondary structure without considering 3D geometry and conformational diversity. We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. Under the hood, gRNAde is a multi-state Graph Neural Network that generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. [2010], gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent RNA polymerase ribozyme structure.

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Molecular Property Predictions with Graph Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent class of data-driven methods for molecular property prediction. However, a key limitation of typical GNN models is their inability to quantify uncertainties in the predictions. This capability is crucial for ensuring the trustworthy use and deployment of models in downstream tasks. To that end, we introduce AutoGNNUQ, an automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach for molecular property prediction. AutoGNNUQ leverages architecture search to generate an ensemble of high-performing GNNs, enabling the estimation of predictive uncertainties. Our approach employs variance decomposition to separate data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainties, providing valuable insights for reducing them. In our computational experiments, we demonstrate that AutoGNNUQ outperforms existing UQ methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and UQ performance on multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally, we utilize t-SNE visualization to explore correlations between molecular features and uncertainty, offering insight for dataset improvement. AutoGNNUQ has broad applicability in domains such as drug discovery and materials science, where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for decision-making.</description>
