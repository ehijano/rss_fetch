      <title>CRES-Based Non-destructive Electron Momentum Estimation for the PTOLEMY Relic Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel electron spectrometry method proposed by the PTOLEMY relic neutrino experiment requires a real-time, non-destructive estimate of the parallel and transverse momentum splits of tritium $\beta$-decay electrons. We propose to obtain this estimate using cyclotron-radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES), in which the kinetic energy of a charged particle is determined by measuring the relativistic frequency shift of the cyclotron radiation emitted by the particle in a magnetic field. This paper presents the first design for a configuration that can be feasibly integrated directly into the existing design for the transverse drift filter proposed by the PTOLEMY collaboration. We propose a geometry incorporating a cavity resonator to enhance a ${\sim}\mathcal{O}(1) \hspace{1mm}\mathrm{fW}$ cyclotron radiation signal and derive key features of the expected observed radiation specific to our RF tracking configuration. We estimate the performance of our design using electromagnetic simulations and present a general signal reconstruction algorithm capable of matching an observed signal to electron kinematic parameters. The projected SNR of this technique demonstrates for the first time that a non-destructive RF tracking system is applicable for the suppression of backgrounds in a differential energy measurement of tritium endpoint electrons.</description>

      <title>Continuously tunable uniaxial strain control of van der Waals heterostructure devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniaxial strain has been widely used as a powerful tool for investigating and controlling the properties of quantum materials. However, existing strain techniques have so far mostly been limited to use with bulk crystals. Although recent progress has been made in extending the application of strain to two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, these techniques have been limited to optical characterization and extremely simple electrical device geometries. Here, we report a piezoelectric-based in-situ uniaxial strain technique enabling simultaneous electrical transport and optical spectroscopy characterization of dual-gated vdW heterostructure devices. Critically, our technique remains compatible with vdW heterostructure devices of arbitrary complexity fabricated on conventional silicon/silicon dioxide wafer substrates. We demonstrate a large and continuously tunable strain of up to $0.15$\% at millikelvin temperatures, with larger strain values also likely achievable. We quantify the strain transmission from the silicon wafer to the vdW heterostructure, and further demonstrate the ability of strain to modify the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene. Our technique provides a highly versatile new method for exploring the effect of uniaxial strain on both the electrical and optical properties of vdW heterostructures, and can be easily extended to include additional characterization techniques.</description>

      <title>TOFHIR2: The readout ASIC of the CMS Barrel MIP Timing Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CMS detector will be upgraded for the HL-LHC to include a MIP Timing Detector (MTD). The MTD will consist of barrel and endcap timing layers, BTL and ETL respectively, providing precision timing of charged particles. The BTL sensors are based on LYSO:Ce scintillation crystals coupled to SiPMs with TOFHIR2 ASICs for the front-end readout. A resolution of 30-60 ps for MIP signals at a rate of 2.5 Mhit/s per channel is expected along the HL-LHC lifetime. We present an overview of the TOFHIR2 requirements and design, simulation results and measurements with TOFHIR2 ASICs. The measurements of TOFHIR2 associated to sensor modules were performed in different test setups using internal test pulses or blue and UV laser pulses emulating the signals expected in the experiment. The measurements show a time resolution of 24 ps initially during Beginning of Operation (BoO) and 58 ps at End of Operation (EoO) conditions, matching well the BTL requirements. We also showed that the time resolution is stable up to the highest expected MIP rate. Extensive radiation tests were performed, both with x-rays and heavy ions, showing that TOFHIR2 is not affected by the radiation environment during the experiment lifetime.</description>

      <title>Cross-Correlated Force Measurement for Thermal Noise Reduction in Torsion Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The torsion pendulum is a prevailing instrument for measuring small forces acting on a solid body or those between solid bodies. While it offers powerful advantages, the measurement precision suffers from thermal noises of the suspending wires giving rise to stochastic torque noises. This letter proposes a new scheme to reduce the effect of such noise by employing a double torsion pendulum and cross-correlation technique based on the theoretical analysis that the thermal torque noise appears at each end of the suspending wire differentially. Cross-correlating two synthesized data streams which are composed of the rotation angles of two torsion stages, it yields the power spectral density estimate of external forces acting on the lower stage with the reduced effect from the thermal torque noises. As an example use case, we discuss the application to the study on the coupling strength of ultra light dark matter to standard model particles. Our evaluation indicates that the upper limit may be improved by an order of magnitude than the previous experiments at 2 mHz, which corresponds to about $8\times10^{-18}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Supernova spotting in Super-Kamiokande Gd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the Super-Kamiokande (SK) neutrino experiment in Japan added gadolinium sulphate octahydrate (Gd) to the pure water in its detector, it has entered a new era in supernova neutrino detection. The addition of Gd makes it possible to tag neutrons from inverse beta decay (IBD) interactions of electron antineutrinos with free protons in the water. This has led to significant improvement in the experiment's sensitivity to low-energy electron antineutrinos, which is key in the observation of supernova neutrinos. Super-Kamiokande Gadolinium (SK-Gd) has the potential to make the first observation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) and pre-supernova (preSN) neutrinos, and can improve the pointing capability of SK in the event of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion. We present the latest results and prospects for supernova neutrino detection with SK-Gd.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the electron-hole pair creation energy in a 4H-SiC p-n diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC), the values for the electron-hole pair creation energy $\epsilon_{\text{i}}$ published in the literature vary significantly. This work presents an experimental determination of $\epsilon_{\text{i}}$ using $50$ $\mu$m 4H-SiC p-n diodes designed for particle detection in high-energy physics. The detector response was measured for $\alpha$ particles between 4.2 MeV and 5.6 MeV for 4H-SiC and a silicon reference device. Different $\alpha$ energies were obtained by using multiple nuclides and varying the effective air gap between the $\alpha$ source and the detector. The energy deposited in the detectors was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the device cross-sections. A linear fit of the detector response to the deposited energy yields $\epsilon_{\text{i}} = (7.83 \pm 0.02)\;\text{eV}$, which agrees well with the most recent literature. For the 4H-SiC detectors, a linewidth of 28 keV FWHM was achieved, corresponding to an energy resolution of 0.5\%.</description>

      <title>Design, construction, and operation of a 1-ton Water-based Liquid scintillator detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water-based liquid scintillators (WbLS) are attractive neutrino detector materials because they allow us to tune the ratio of the Cherenkov and scintillation signals. Using WbLS large-scale neutrino experiments can benefit from both directional reconstruction and enhanced low-energy efficiency. Furthermore, broadening the science capability of such materials by metal doping may be better suited for water based liquid scintillators. We recently constructed and commissioned a 1-ton WbLS detector with good photosensor coverage and a capable data acquisition system. We intend to use this flexible detector system as a testbed for WbLS R&amp;D. In this paper we give an overview of the 1-ton system and provide some early analysis results.</description>

      <title>Development of advanced photon calibrator for Kamioka gravitational wave detector (KAGRA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kamioka Gravitational wave detector (KAGRA) cryogenic gravitational-wave observatory has commenced joint observations with the worldwide gravitational wave detector network. Precise calibration of the detector response is essential for accurately estimating parameters of gravitational wave sources. A photon calibrator is a crucial calibration tool used in laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, Virgo, and KAGRA, and it was utilized in joint observation 3 with GEO600 in Germany in April 2020. In this paper, KAGRA implemented three key enhancements: a high-power laser, a power stabilization system, and remote beam position control. KAGRA employs a 20 W laser divided into two beams that are injected onto the mirror surface. By utilizing a high-power laser, the response of the detector at kHz frequencies can be calibrated. To independently control the power of each laser beam, an optical follower servo was installed for power stabilization. The optical path of the photon calibrator beam positions was controlled using pico-motors, allowing for the characterization of the detector rotation response. Additionally, a telephoto camera and quadrant photodetectors were installed to monitor beam positions, and beam position control was implemented to optimize the mirror response. In this paper, we discuss the statistical errors associated with the measurement of relative power noise. We also address systematic errors related to the power calibration model of the photon calibrator and the simulation of elastic deformation effects using finite element analysis. Ultimately, we have successfully reduced the total systematic error from the photon calibrator to 2.0 /%.</description>

      <title>Polarization-artifact reduction and accuracy improvement of Jones-matrix polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography by multi-focus averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) is a promising biomedical imaging tool for differentiation of various tissue properties. However, the presence of multiple-scattering (MS) signals can degrade the quantitative polarization measurement accuracy. We demonstrate a method to reduce MS signals and increase the measurement accuracy of Jones matrix PS-OCT. This method suppresses MS signals by averaging of multiple Jones matrix volumes measured using different focal positions. The MS signals are decorrelated among the volumes by focus position modulation and are thus reduced by averaging. However, the single scattering signals are kept consistent among the focus-modulated volumes by computational refocusing. We validated the proposed method using a scattering phantom and a postmortem medaka fish. The results showed reduced artifacts in birefringence and degree-of-polarization uniformity measurements, particularly in deeper regions in the samples. This method offers a practical solution to mitigate MS-induced artifacts in PS-OCT imaging and improves quantitative polarization measurement accuracy.</description>

      <title>Prototyping a High Purity Germanium cryogenic veto system for a bolometric detection experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of High Purity Germanium detectors operated in ionization mode at cryogenic temperatures is investigated as an external background mitigation solution for bolometers used in rare-event search experiments. A simple experimental setup with very partial coverage, running a 52-g $\mathrm{Li_2WO_4}$ bolometer sandwiched in-between two 2-cm thick High Purity Germanium cylindrical detectors in a dry cryostat, shows promising rejection to environmental gammas and atmospheric muons backgrounds. The acquired data are used together with a Monte Carlo simulation of the setup to extract the main contributions to the external backgrounds expected in an above ground experiment, such as e.g.~current and future experimental efforts targeting the detection of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering at reactor facilities. Based on all these results, a $\mathrm{4\pi}$ coverage similar veto system achieving a $\mathcal{O}$(10 keV) energy threshold is expected to achieve a $\mathrm{\gtrsim}$ 70 \% and a $\mathrm{\gtrsim}$ 97 \% rejection power for gamma-like and muon-like events, respectively.</description>
