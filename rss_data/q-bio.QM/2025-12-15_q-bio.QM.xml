      <title>Boosted Random Forests for Predicting Treatment Failure of Chemotherapy Regimens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer patients may undergo lengthy and painful chemotherapy treatments, comprising several successive regimens or plans. Treatment inefficacy and other adverse events can lead to discontinuation (or failure) of these plans, or prematurely changing them, which results in a significant amount of physical, financial, and emotional toxicity to the patients and their families. In this work, we build treatment failure models based on the Real World Evidence (RWE) gathered from patients' profiles available in our oncology EMR/EHR system. We also describe our feature engineering pipeline, experimental methods, and valuable insights obtained about treatment failures from trained models. We report our findings on five primary cancer types with the most frequent treatment failures (or discontinuations) to build unique and novel feature vectors from the clinical notes, diagnoses, and medications that are available in our oncology EMR. After following a novel three axes - performance, complexity and explainability - design exploration framework, boosted random forests are selected because they provide a baseline accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 75%, with reduced model complexity, thus making them more interpretable to and usable by oncologists.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate measurement of the worker populations of honey bee colonies using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honey bees play a crucial role in pollination, contributing significantly to global agriculture and ecosystems. Accurately estimating hive populations is essential for understanding the effects of environmental factors on bee colonies, yet traditional methods of counting bees are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, particularly in large-scale studies. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based solution for automating bee population counting using CSRNet and introduce ASUBEE, the FIRST high-resolution dataset specifically designed for this task. Our method employs density map estimation to predict bee populations, effectively addressing challenges such as occlusion and overlapping bees that are common in hive monitoring. We demonstrate that CSRNet achieves superior performance in terms of time efficiency, with a computation time of just 1 second per image, while delivering accurate counts even in complex and densely populated hive scenarios. Our findings show that deep learning approaches like CSRNet can dramatically enhance the efficiency of hive population assessments, providing a valuable tool for researchers and beekeepers alike. This work marks a significant advancement in applying AI technologies to ecological research, offering scalable and precise monitoring solutions for honey bee populations.</description>

      <title>Agave villalobosii (secci\'on Ditepalae, Agavaceae), una especie nueva de la meseta central Mexicana de aguascalientes y zacatecas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agave villalobosii sp. nov. (sect. Ditepalae, Agavaceae, Asparagales) from the Mexican central plain in Aguascalientes and southern Zacatecas, Mexico, is described and illustrated. It resembles A. flexispina in terms of color and the general appearance of its rosettes. However, it differs from the latter in having fewer leaves with more widely spaced teeth, more compact and shorter panicles with more inclined lateral branches with respect to the horizontal plane, and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid capsules. A distribution map for both species is provided. The species was preliminary assessed as critically endangered.</description>

      <title>DREAM-B3P: Dual-Stream Transformer Network Enhanced by Feedback Diffusion Model for Blood-Brain Barrier Penetrating Peptide Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the central nervous system but prevents most neurotherapeutics from reaching effective concentrations in the brain. BBB-penetrating peptides (BBBPs) offer a promising strategy for brain drug delivery; however, the scarcity of positive samples and severe class imbalance hinder the reliable identification of BBBPs.
  Objectives: Our goal is to alleviate class imbalance in BBBP prediction and to develop an accurate, interpretable classifier for BBBP prediction.
  Methods: We propose DREAM-B3P, which couples a feedback diffusion model (FB-Diffusion) for data augmentation with a dual-stream Transformer for classification. FB-Diffusion learns the BBBP distribution via iterative denoising and uses an external analyzer to provide feedback, generating high-quality pseudo-BBBPs. The classifier contains a sequence stream that extracts structural features from peptide sequences and a physicochemical stream that captures physicochemical features such as hydrophobic surface area, molecular charge, number of rotatable bonds, and polarizability. Combining the two features leads to superior BBBP predictive performance.
  Results: On a benchmark test set containing equal numbers of BBBPs and non-BBBPs, DREAM-B3P surpasses baseline methods (Deep-B3P, B3Pred, BBPpredict and Augur), improving AUC/ACC/MCC by 4.3\%/17.8\%/14.9\%, respectively, over the second-best method.
  Conclusion: By integrating feedback diffusion with a dual-stream Transformer classifier, DREAM-B3P effectively mitigates data scarcity and imbalance and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness in Plant Water Stress Classification based on Morpho-Kinematic via Biological Sectoring and Adaptive Linear Opinion Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise irrigation management requires robust classification of plant water stress. We expanded a morpho-kinematic (MK) framework that derives canopy-movement features from RGB time-lapse imaging evaluating how methodological refinements affect robustness and fine discrimination across four irrigation treatments representing distinct stress histories. The study tested both a biological (Agg) versus an isogonal (Unif) sectoring of the canopy image, within an additive scheme where to the baseline (i.e. flattened MK features, A0) were sequentially added non-linear descriptors (A1), irrigation-context variables (i.e. dry time, A2), and their interactions with baseline (A3). The multi-class problem was decomposed in biologically meaningful binary tasks, and the final classification confronted an adaptive - to the performance obtained in the out-of-fold predictions inside the leave-one-sample-out validation framework - linear opinion pooling (ALOP) ensemble, evaluated across its full parameter space, against hierarchical cascades (HCC). In our combined dataset from two sequential Lactuca sativa experiments (144 sample-days) ALOP median outperformed HCC in every configuration, while non-linear and contextual enrichments (A1-A2) produced consistent improvements in terms of prediction stability, variability (for ALOP), and balanced accuracy (BA). The highest balanced accuracy (median BA = 0.96) was reached under Unif scheme in A3, yet the Agg configuration in A2 achieved the best compromise between accuracy (median BA approx 0.91) and robustness. Concluding, this study identifies methodological pathways that strengthen resilience and transferability of movement-based water-stress classification, establishing a solid foundation for generalizable, low-cost phenotyping.</description>

      <title>MolSculpt: Sculpting 3D Molecular Geometries from Chemical Syntax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating precise 3D molecular geometries is crucial for drug discovery and material science. While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that "sculpts" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/SakuraTroyChen/MolSculpt.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Simulation-based Inference Methods for Stochastic Compartmental Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global pandemics, such as the recent COVID-19 crisis, highlight the need for stochastic epidemic models that can capture the randomness inherent in the spread of disease. Such models must be accompanied by methods for estimating parameters in order to generate fast nowcasts and short-term forecasts that can inform public health decisions. This paper presents a comparison of two advanced Bayesian inference methods: 1) pseudo-marginal particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, short Particle Filters (PF), and 2) Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNF). We investigate their performance on two commonly used compartmental models: a classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and a two-variant Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, complemented by an observation model that maps latent trajectories to empirical data. Addressing the challenges of intractable likelihoods for parameter inference in stochastic settings, our analysis highlights how these likelihood-free methods provide accurate and robust inference capabilities. The results of our simulation study further underscore the effectiveness of these approaches in capturing the stochastic dynamics of epidemics, providing prediction capabilities for the control of epidemic outbreaks. Results on an Ethiopian cohort study demonstrate operational robustness under real-world noise and irregular data sampling. To facilitate reuse and to enable building pipelines that ultimately contribute to better informed decision making in public health, we make code and synthetic datasets publicly available.</description>

      <title>Towards smart canopies: Algorithmic design of maize canopy architectures that maximize light use efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational framework that integrates functional-structural plant modeling (FSPM) with an evolutionary algorithm to optimize three-dimensional maize canopy architecture for enhanced light interception under high-density planting. The optimization revealed an emergent ideotype characterized by two distinct strategies: a vertically stratified leaf profile (steep, narrow upper leaves for penetration; broad, horizontal lower leaves for capture) and a radially tiled azimuthal arrangement that breaks the conventional distichous symmetry of maize to minimize self and mutual shading. Reverse ray-tracing simulations show that this architecture intercepts significantly more photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than virtual canopies parameterized from high-performing field hybrids, with gains that generalize across multiple U.S. latitudes and planting densities. The optimized trait combinations align with characteristics of modern density-tolerant cultivars, supporting biological plausibility. Because recent gene editing advances enable more independent control of architectural traits, the designs identified here are increasingly feasible. By uncovering effective, non-intuitive trait configurations, our approach provides a scalable, predictive tool to guide breeding targets, improve light-use efficiency, and ultimately support sustainable yield gains.</description>

      <title>HyperSBINN: A Hypernetwork-Enhanced Systems Biology-Informed Neural Network for Efficient Drug Cardiosafety Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling in systems toxicology enables a comprehensive understanding of the effects of pharmaceutical substances on cardiac health. However, the complexity of these models limits their widespread application in early drug discovery. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solving parameterized models of cardiac action potentials by combining meta-learning techniques with Systems Biology-Informed Neural Networks (SBINNs). The proposed method, hyperSBINN, effectively addresses the challenge of predicting the effects of various compounds at different concentrations on cardiac action potentials, outperforming traditional differential equation solvers in speed. Our model efficiently handles scenarios with limited data and complex parameterized differential equations. The hyperSBINN model demonstrates robust performance in predicting APD90 values, indicating its potential as a reliable tool for modeling cardiac electrophysiology and aiding in preclinical drug development. This framework represents an advancement in computational modeling, offering a scalable and efficient solution for simulating and understanding complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>PUMA: Discovery of Protein Units via Mutation-Aware Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proteins are the essential drivers of biological processes. At the molecular level, they are chains of amino acids that can be viewed through a linguistic lens where the twenty standard residues serve as an alphabet combining to form a complex language, referred to as the language of life. To understand this language, we must first identify its fundamental units. Analogous to words, these units are hypothesized to represent an intermediate layer between single residues and larger domains. Crucially, just as protein diversity arises from evolution, these units should inherently reflect evolutionary relationships. We introduce PUMA (Protein Units via Mutation-Aware Merging) to discover these evolutionarily meaningful units. PUMA employs an iterative merging algorithm guided by substitution matrices to identify protein units and organize them into families linked by plausible mutations. This process creates a hierarchical genealogy where parent units and their mutational variants coexist, simultaneously producing a unit vocabulary and the genealogical structure connecting them. We validate that PUMA families are biologically meaningful; mutations within a PUMA family correlate with clinically benign variants and with high-scoring mutations in high-throughput assays. Furthermore, these units align with the contextual preferences of protein language models and map to known functional annotations. PUMA's genealogical framework provides evolutionarily grounded units, offering a structured approach for understanding the language of life.</description>
