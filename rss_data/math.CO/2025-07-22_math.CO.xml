      <title>Partition algebras as monoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wilcox has considered a twisted semigroup algebra structure on the partition algebra $\mathbb{C}A_k(n)$, but it appears that there has not previously been any known basis that gives $\mathbb{C}A_k(n)$ the structure of a "non-twisted" semigroup algebra or a monoid algebra. This motivates the following problem, for the non-degenerate case whereby $n \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \{ 0, 1, \ldots, 2 k - 2 \}$ so that $ \mathbb{C}A_k(n)$ is semisimple. How could a basis $M_{k} = M$ of $ \mathbb{C}A_k(n)$ be constructed so that $M$ is closed under the multiplicative operation on $\mathbb{C}A_k(n)$, in such a way so that $M$ is a monoid under this operation, and how could a product rule for elements in $M$ be defined in an explicit and combinatorial way in terms of partition diagrams? We construct a basis $M$ of the desired form using Halverson and Ram's matrix unit construction for partition algebras, Benkart and Halverson's bijection between vacillating tableaux and set-partition tableaux, an analogue given by Colmenarejo et al. for partition diagrams of the RSK correspondence, and a variant of a result due to Hewitt and Zuckerman characterizing finite-dimensional semisimple algebras that are isomorphic to semigroup algebras.</description>

      <title>On the classification of triply-transitive strongly-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma = (\Omega,E)$ be a strongly-regular graph with adjacency matrix $A_1$, and let $A_2$ be the adjacency matrix of its complement. For any vertex $\omega\in \Omega$, we define $E_{0,\omega}^*$ $E_{1,\omega}^*$ and $E_{2,\omega}^*$ to be respectively the diagonal matrices whose main diagonal is the row corresponding to $\omega$ in the matrices $I, A_1$, and $A_2$. The Terwilliger algebra of $\Gamma$ with respect to the vertex $\omega\in \Omega$ is the subalgebra $T_\omega = \left\langle I,A_1,A_2,E_{0,\omega}^*,E_{1,\omega}^*,E_{2,\omega}^* \right\rangle$ of the complex matrix algebra $\operatorname{M_{|\Omega|}}(\mathbb{C})$. The algebra $T_\omega$ contains the subspace $T_{0,\omega} = \operatorname{Span}\left\{ E_{i,\omega}^*A_jE_{k,\omega}^*: 0\leq i,j,k\leq 2 \right\}$.
  In addition, if $G = \Aut{\Gamma}$, then $T_\omega$ is a subalgebra of the centralizer algebra $\tilde{T}_\omega = \End{G_\omega}{\mathbb{C}^\Omega}$.
  The strongly-regular graph $\Gamma=(\Omega,E)$ is triply transitive if $\Gamma$ is vertex transitive and $T_{0,\omega} = T_\omega = \tilde{T}_\omega$, for any $\omega \in \Omega$. In this paper, we classify all triply transitive strongly-regular graphs that are not isomorphic to the collinearity graph of the polar space $O_{6}^-(q)$, where $q$ is a prime power, or the affine polar graph $\vo_{2m}^\varepsilon(2)$, where $m\geq 1$ and $\varepsilon = \pm 1$.</description>

      <title>Cops and Robbers, Clique Covers, and Induced Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cops and Robbers game played on finite simple graphs. In a graph $G$, the number of cops required to capture a robber in the Cops and Robbers game is denoted by $c(G)$. For all graphs $G$, $c(G) \leq \alpha(G) \leq \theta(G)$ where $\alpha(G)$ and $\theta(G)$ are the independence number and clique cover number respectively. In 2022 Turcotte asked if $c(G) &lt; \alpha(G)$ for all graphs with $\alpha(G) \geq 3$. Recently, Char, Maniya, and Pradhan proved this is false, at least when $\alpha = 3$,by demonstrating the compliment of the Shrikhande graph has cop number and independence number $3$. We prove, using random graphs, the stronger result that for all $k\geq 1$ there exists a graph $G$ such that $c(G) = \alpha(G) = \theta(G) = k$. Next, we consider the structure of graphs with $c(G) = \theta(G) \geq 3$. We prove, using structural arguments, that any graphs $G$ which satisfies $c(G) = \theta(G) = k \geq 3$ contain induced cycles of all lengths $3\leq t \leq k+1$. This implies all perfect graphs $G$ with $\alpha(G)\geq 4$ have $c(G) &lt; \alpha(G)$. Additionally,we discuss if typical triangle-free and $C_4$-free graphs will have $c(G) &lt; \alpha(G)$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial generation via permutation languages. VII. Supersolvable hyperplane arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arrangement $\mathcal{H}$ of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ through the origin, a region is a connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\mathcal{H}$. The graph of regions $G(\mathcal{H})$ has a vertex for every region, and an edge between any two vertices whose corresponding regions are separated by a single hyperplane from $\mathcal{H}$. We aim to compute a Hamiltonian path or cycle in the graph $G(\mathcal{H})$, i.e., a path or cycle that visits every vertex (=region) exactly once. Our first main result is that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a supersolvable arrangement, then the graph of regions $G(\mathcal{H})$ has a Hamiltonian cycle. More generally, we consider quotients of lattice congruences of the poset of regions $P(\mathcal{H},R_0)$, obtained by orienting the graph $G(\mathcal{H})$ away from a particular base region $R_0$. Our second main result is that if $\mathcal{H}$ is supersolvable and $R_0$ is a canonical base region, then for any lattice congruence $\equiv$ on $P(\mathcal{H},R_0)=:L$, the cover graph of the quotient lattice $L/\equiv$ has a Hamiltonian path.

      <description>arXiv:2507.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that strata of oriented toric hyperplane arrangements are in bijection with a collection of lattice points in a zonotope. Moreover, we relate the dimension of the stratum and the dimension of the minimal face of the zonotope containing the corresponding lattice point. We discuss how this correspondence is related to toric varieties and the Bondal-Thomsen generators of their derived categories.</description>

      <title>Stable matchings with switching costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a stable matching problem there are two groups of agents, with agents on one side having their individual preferences for agents on another side as a potential match. It is assumed silently that agents can freely and costlessly ``switch" partners. A matching is called stable if no two unmatched agents prefer each other to their matches. Half a century ago, for equinumerous sides, Knuth demonstrated existence of preferences for which there are exponentially many stable matchings, and he posed a problem of evaluating an expected number of stable matchings when the preferences are uniformly random and independent. It was shown later by Pittel that this expectation is quite moderate, asymptotic to $e^{-1}n\log n$, $n$ being the number of agents on each side. The proof used Knuth's integral formula for the expectation based on a classic inclusion-exclusion counting. In later papers by Pittel this and other integral formulas were obtained by generating preference lists via a pair of random matrices, with independently random, $[0,1]$-uniform entries, rather than from a progressively problematic counting approach. The novelty of this paper is that we view the matrix entries as a basis for cardinal utilities that each agent ascribes to the agents on the other side. Relaxing the notion of stability, we declare matching stable if no unmatched pair of agents {\it strongly\/} prefer each other to their partners, with ``strength'' measured by a parameter $\eps&gt;0$, $\eps=0$ corresponding to classic stability. We show that for $\eps$ of order $n^{-1}\log n$ the expected number of $\eps$-stable matchings is polynomially large, but for $\eps\gg n^{-1}\log n$ {\it however slightly\/} the expectation is suddenly super-polynomially large. This ``explosion'' phenomenon for a very small strength parameter $\eps$ continues to hold for imbalanced matchings, regardless of the imbalance size.</description>

      <title>Graphs With the Same Edge Count in Each Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Caro, Lauri, Mifsud, Yuster, and Zarb ask which parameters $r$ and $c$ admit the existence of an $r$-regular graph such that the neighborhood of each vertex induces exactly $c$ edges. They show that every $r$ with $c$ satisfying $0\leq c\leq {r\choose 2}-5r^{3/2}$ is achievable, but no $r$ with $c$ satisfying ${r\choose 2}-\lfloor\frac{r}{3}\rfloor\leq c\leq {r\choose 2}-1$ is. We strengthen the bound in their nonexistence result from ${r\choose 2}-\lfloor\frac{r}{3}\rfloor$ to ${r\choose 2}-\lfloor\frac{r-2}{2}\rfloor$. Additionally, when the graph is the Cayley graph of an abelian group, we obtain a much more fine-grained characterization of the achievable values of $c$ between $\binom{r}{2} - 5r^{3/2}$ and $\binom{r}{2} - \lfloor\frac{r-2}{2}\rfloor$, which we conjecture to be the correct answer for general graphs as well. That result relies on a lemma about approximate subgroups in the "99% regime," quantifying the extent to which nearly-additively-closed subsets of an abelian group must be close to actual subgroups. Finally, we consider a generalization to graphs with multiple types of edges and partially resolve several open questions of Caro et al. about $\textit{flip}$ colorings of graphs.</description>

      <title>On the subdirect product of graph bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subdirect product of two finite groups $A$ and $B$ is defined as a subgroup of the direct product $A \times B$, which is a well-known notion in finite group theory. While it is clear that, under appropriate choices of sets of generators $S$, $S_A$ and $S_B$, the Cayley graph $Cay(A \times B, S)$ corresponds to the Cartesian product $Cay(A, S_A) \square Cay(B, S_B)$ of two graphs, there is no analogue at the level of graph product that reflects the notion of subdirect product of groups. This is precisely the problem which we discuss here. By using the concept of graph bundles and the corresponding pullbacks, we introduce an operation on graph bundles such that the Cayley graph of the subdirect product of two groups can be described as the total space of the product of the Cayley graphs. This allows us to define the so-called ``network $K$-theory group of a graph'', inspired by the notion of topological $K$-theory, and we are able to investigate an interesting functor from the category of graphs to the category of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Extremal Degree Irregularity Bounds for Albertson and Sigma Indices in Trees and Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, study of extreme values of bounds in topological indices plays an important role in determining the impact of these indices on trees and bipartite graphs. For any integers $\alpha, p$ where $1\leq p\leq \alpha\leq \Delta-3$, the upper bound of the minimum value of Albertson index $\operatorname{irr}_{\min}$ satisfy: \[
  \operatorname{irr}_{\min}\geqslant \Delta^2(\Delta-1)\frac{2^{\alpha}}{(\Delta-p)^2}.
  \]
  Studies the maximum and minimum values of the Albertson index in bipartite graphs based on the sizes of their bipartition sets. Leveraging a known corollary, explicit formulas and bounds are derived that characterize the irregularity measure under various vertex size conditions. Upper bounds for both the Albertson and Sigma indices are established using graph parameters such as degrees and edge counts. Theoretical results are supported by examples and inequalities involving degree sequences, enhancing understanding of extremal irregularity behavior in bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>On the edge reconstruction of the second immanantal polynomials of undirected graph and digraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M=(m_{ij})$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. The second immanant of matrix $M$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} d_{2}(M)=\sum_{\sigma\in S_{n}}\chi_{2}(\sigma)\prod_{s=1}^{n}m_{s\sigma(s)}, \end{eqnarray*} where $\chi_{2}$ is the irreducible character of $S_{n}$ corresponding to the partition $(2^{1},1^{n-2})$. The polynomial $d_{2}(xI-M)$ is called the second immanantal polynomial of matrix $M$. Denote by $D(G)$ (resp. $D(\overrightarrow{G})$) and $A(G)$ (resp. $A(\overrightarrow{G})$) the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees and the adjacency matrix of undirected graph $G$ (resp. digraph $\overrightarrow{G}$), respectively. In this article, we prove that $d_{2}(xI-A(G))$ (resp. $d_{2}(xI-A(\overrightarrow{G}))$) can be reconstructed from the second immanantal polynomials of the adjacency matrix of all subgraphs in $\{G-uv,G-u-v|uv\in E(G)\}$ (resp. $\{\overrightarrow{G}-e|e\in E(\overrightarrow{G})\}$). Furthermore, the polynomial $d_{2}(xI-D(\overrightarrow{G})\pm A(\overrightarrow{G}))$ can also be reconstructed by the second immanantal polynomials of the (signless) Laplacian matrixs of all subgraphs in $\{\overrightarrow{G}-e|e\in E(\overrightarrow{G})\}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On Fragile Power Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power domination is a graph theoretic model which captures how phasor measurement units (PMUs) can be used to monitor a power grid. Fragile power domination takes into account the fact that PMUs may break or otherwise fail. In this model, each sensor fails independently with probability $q\in [0,1]$ and the surviving sensors monitor the grid according to classical power domination.
  We study the expected number of observed nodes under the fragile power domination model. We give a characterization for when two networks and initial sensor placements will behave the same according to this expectation. We also show how to control the behavior of this expectation by adding structure to a network.</description>

Abstract: Two graphs $G_1,G_2$ are distinguished by the Weisfeiler--Leman isomorphism test if and only if there is a tree $T$ that has a different number of homomorphisms to $G_1$ and to $G_2$. There are two known proofs of this fact -- a logical proof by Dvorak and a linear-algebraic proof by Dell, Grohe, and Rattan. We give another simple proof, based on ordering WL-labels and asymptotic arguments.</description>

      <title>Representation theory for polymatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of representations of (discrete) polymatroids over tracts in terms of Pl\"ucker coordinates and suitable Pl\"ucker relations. As special cases, we recover polymatroids themselves as polymatroid representations over the Krasner hyperfield K and M-convex functions as polymatroid representations over the tropical hyperfield.
  We introduce and study several useful operations for polymatroid representations, such as translation and refined notions of minors and duality which have better properties than the existing definitions; for example, deletion and contraction become dual operations (up to translation) in our setting. We also prove an idempotency principle which asserts that polymatroids which are not translates of matroids are representable only over tracts that are idempotent in a certain specific sense (in particular -1 = 1).
  The space of all representations of a polymatroid J, which we call the thin Schubert cell of J, is represented by an algebraic object called {universal tract of J. When we restrict to just the 3-term Pl\"ucker relations, we obtain the weak thin Schubert cell, and passing to torus orbits yields the realization space. These are represented by the universal pasture and the foundation of J, respectively. We exhibit a canonical bijection between the universal tract and the universal pasture, which is new even in the case of matroids, and we show that the foundation of a polymatroid is generated by cross ratios. We also describe a (possibly incomplete) list of multiplicative relations between cross ratios.
  Thin Schubert cells and realization spaces are canonically embedded in certain tori. Over idempotent tracts, we show that thin Schubert cells contain a canonical torus orbit and split naturally as a product of the realization space with this distinguished torus.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of certain matroids by maximizing valuative invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luis Ferroni and Alex Fink recently introduced a polytope of all unlabeled matroids of rank $r$ on $n$ elements, and they showed that the vertices of this polytope come from matroids that can be characterized by maximizing a sequence of valuative invariants. We prove that a number of the matroids that they conjectured to yield vertices indeed do (these include cycle matroids of complete graphs, projective geometries, and Dowling geometries), and we give additional examples (including truncations of cycle matroids of complete graphs, Bose-Burton geometries, and binary and free spikes with tips). We prove a special case of a conjecture of Ferroni and Fink by showing that direct sums of uniform matroids yield vertices of their polytope, and we prove a similar result for direct sums whose components are in certain restricted classes of extremal matroids.</description>

      <title>Basis partitions and their signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basis partitions are minimal partitions corresponding to successive rank vectors. We show combinatorially how basis partitions can be generated from primary partitions which are equivalent to the Rogers-Ramanujan partitions. This leads to the definition of a signature of a basis partition that we use to explain certain parity results. We then study a special class of basis partitions which we term as complete. Finally we discuss basis partitions and minimal basis partitions among partitions with non-repeating odd parts by representing them using 2-modular graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exist infinitely many classes of intersection graphs of geometric objects that are not $\chi$-bounded -- namely, $d$-CBU graphs for $d\geq 3$ -- and each is incomparable with the class of Burling graphs. This answers a folklore open problem on whether Burling graphs are the sole source of unbounded chromatic number among geometric intersection classes.</description>

      <title>Local (Outer) Multiset Dimensions of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite, connected, undirected, and simple graph and $W$ be a set of vertices in $G$. A representation multiset of a vertex $u$ in $V(G)$ with respect to $W$ is defined as the multiset of distances between $u$ and the vertices in $W$. If every two adjacent vertices in $V(G)$ have a distinct multiset representation, the set $W$ is called a local multiset resolving set of $G$. If $G$ has a local multiset resolving set, then this set with the smallest cardinality is called the local multiset basis, and its cardinality is the local multiset dimension of $G$. Otherwise, $G$ is said to have an infinite local multiset dimension.
  On the other hand, if every two adjacent vertices in $V(G) \backslash W$ have a distinct representation multiset, the set $W$ is called a local outer multiset resolving set of $G$. Such a set with the smallest cardinality is called the local outer multiset basis, and its cardinality is the local outer multiset dimension of $G$. Unlike the local multiset dimension, every graph has a finite local outer multiset dimension.
  This paper presents some basic properties of local (outer) multiset dimensions, including lower bounds for the dimensions and a necessary condition for a finite local multiset dimension. We also determine local (outer) multiset dimensions for some graphs of small diameter.</description>

      <title>Fair coalition in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph. A dominating set of $G$ is a subset $D\subseteq V$ such that every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. The cardinality of a smallest dominating set of $G$, denoted by $\gamma(G)$, is the domination number of $G$. For $k \geq 1$, a $k$-fair dominating set ($kFD$-set) in $G$, is a dominating set $S$ such that $|N(v) \cap D|=k$ for every vertex $ v \in V\setminus D$. A fair dominating set in $G$ is a $kFD$-set for some integer $k\geq 1$. A fair coalition in a graph $G$ is a pair of disjoint subsets $A_1, A_2 \subseteq A$ that satisfy the following conditions: (a) neither $A_1$ nor $A_2$ constitutes a fair dominating set of $G$, and (b) $A_1\cup A_2$ constitutes a fair dominating set of $G$. A fair coalition partition of a graph $G$ is a partition $\Upsilon = \{A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_k\}$ of its vertex set such that every set $A_i$ of $\Upsilon$ is either a singleton fair dominating set of $G$, or is not a fair dominating set of $G$ but forms a fair coalition with another non-fair dominating set $A_j\in \Upsilon$. We define the fair coalition number of $G$ as the maximum cardinality of a fair coalition partition of $G$, and we denote it by $\mathcal{C}_f(G)$. We initiate the study of the fair coalition in graphs and obtain $\mathcal{C}_f(G)$ for some specific graphs.</description>

      <title>On rainbow caterpillars in elementary $p$-groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite Abelian group $(A,+)$, consider a tree $T$ with $|A|$ vertices. The labeling $f \colon V (T) \rightarrow A$ of the vertices of some graph $G$ induces an edge labeling in $G$, thus the edge $uv$ receives the label $f (u) + f (v)$.
  The tree $T$ is $A$-rainbow colored if $f$ is a bijection and edges have different colors. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a caterpillar with three spine vertices to be $A$-rainbow, when $A$ is an elementary $p$-group.</description>

      <title>A result on spanning trees with bounded total excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and $T$ a spanning tree of $G$. Let $\rho(G)$ denote the adjacency spectral radius of $G$. The $k$-excess of a vertex $v$ in $T$ is defined as $\max\{0,d_T(v)-k\}$. The total $k$-excess $\mbox{te}(T,k)$ is defined by $\mbox{te}(T,k)=\sum\limits_{v\in V(T)}{\max\{0,d_T(v)-k\}}$. A tree $T$ is said to be a $k$-tree if $d_T(v)\leq k$ for any $v\in V(T)$, that is to say, the maximum degree of a $k$-tree is at most $k$. In fact, $T$ is a spanning $k$-tree if and only if $\mbox{te}(T,k)=0$. This paper studies a generalization of spanning $k$-trees using a concept called total $k$-excess and proposes a lower bound for $\rho(G)$ in a connected graph $G$ to ensure that $G$ contains a spanning tree $T$ with $\mbox{te}(T,k)\leq b$, where $k$ and $b$ are two nonnegative integers with $k\geq\max\{5,b+3\}$ and $(b,k)\neq(2,5)$.</description>

      <title>Subgroup Perfect Codes of $\mathcal{A}_t$-Groups and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $C$ of the vertex set of a graph $\Gamma$ is called a perfect code in $\Gamma$ if every vertex of $\Gamma$ is at distance no more than 1 to exactly one vertex of $C$. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a subgroup perfect code of $G$ if $H$ is a perfect code in some Cayley graph of $G$. Recently, Zhang reveals that the study of subgroup perfect codes of finite groups naturally reduces to the case of $p$-groups, especially $2$-groups. Based on the combined works of Berkovich, Janko and Zhang, every $p$-group is an $\mathcal{A}_t$-group. In this work, we establish a complete classification of subgroup perfect codes of $\mathcal{A}_t$-groups for $t \in\{0, 1\}$. Moreover, subgroup perfect codes of finite groups with abelian Sylow $2$-subgroups are also characterized.</description>

      <title>Twists, Higher Dimer Covers, and Web Duality for Grassmannian Cluster Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a twisted version of Fraser, Lam, and Le's higher boundary measurement map, using face weights instead of edge weights, thereby providing Laurent polynomial expansions, in Pl\"ucker coordinates, for twisted web immanants for Grassmannians. In some small cases, Fraser, Lam, and Le observe a phenomenon they call "web duality'', where web immanants coincide with web invariants, and they conjecture that this duality corresponds to transposing the standard Young tableaux that index basis webs. We show that this duality continues to hold for a large set of $\text{SL}_3$ and $\text{SL}_4$ webs. Combining this with our twisted higher boundary measurement map, we recover and extend formulas of Elkin-Musiker-Wright for twists of certain cluster variables. We also provide evidence supporting conjectures of Fomin-Pylyavskyy as well as one by Cheung-Dechant-He-Heyes-Hirst-Li concerning classification of cluster variables of low Pl\"ucker degree in $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(3,n)]$.</description>

      <title>Signless Laplacian spectral analysis of a class of graph joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be determined by its signless Laplacian spectrum (abbreviated as DQS) if no other non-isomorphic graph shares the same signless Laplacian spectrum. In this paper, we establish the following results:
  (1). Every graph of the form $K_1 \vee (C_s \cup qK_2)$, where $q \ge 0$, $s \ge 3$, and the number of vertices is at least $16$, is DQS;
  (2). Every graph of the form $K_1 \vee (C_{s_1} \cup C_{s_2} \cup \cdots \cup C_{s_t} \cup qK_2)$, where $t \ge 2$, $q \ge 0$, $s_i \ge 3$, and the number of vertices is at least $52$, is DQS.
  Here, $K_n$ and $C_n$ denote the complete graph and the cycle of order $n$, respectively, while $\cup$ and $\vee$ represent the disjoint union and the join of graphs. Moreover, the signless Laplacian spectrum of the graphs under consideration is computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian bypasses in digraphs and bipartite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian path in a digraph $D$ in which the initial vertex dominates the terminal vertex is called a Hamiltonian bypass. Let $D$ be a 2-strong digraph of order $p\geq 3$ and let $z$ be some vertex of $D$. Suppose that every vertex of $D$ other than $z$ has degree at least $p$. We introduce and study a conjecture which claims that there exists a smallest integer $k$ such that if $d(z)\geq k$, then $D$ contains a Hamiltonian bypass. In this paper, we prove: (i) If $D$ is Hamiltonian or $z$ has a degree greater than $(p-1)/3$,
  then $D$ contains a Hamiltonian bypass. (ii) If a strong balanced bipartite digraph $B$ of order $2a\geq 6$ satisfies the condition that $d^+(u)+d^-(v)\geq a+1$ for all vertices $u$ and $v$ from different partite sets such that $B$ does not contain the arc $uv$, then $B$ contains a Hamiltonian bypass. Furthermore, the lower bound $a+1$ is sharp. The first result improves a result of Benhocine (J. of Graph Theory, 8, 1984) and a result of the author (Math. Problems of Computer Science,
  54, 2020)
  We also suggest some conjectures and problems.</description>

      <title>Paired many-to-many 2-disjoint path cover of Johnson graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two 2 disjoint vertex-sets $S=\{u,x\}$ and $T=\{v,y\}$, a paired many-to-many 2-disjoint path cover joining S and T, is a set of two vertex-disjoint paths with endpoints $u,v$ and $x,y$, respectively, that cover every vertex of the graph. If the graph has a many-to-many 2-disjoint path cover for any two disjoint vertex-sets $S$ and $T$, then it is called paired 2-coverable. It is known that if a graph is paired 2-coverable, then it must be Hamilton-connected, but the reverse is not true. It has been proved that Johnson graphs $J(n,k)$, $0\le k\le n$, are Hamilton-connected by Brian Alspach in [Ars Math. Contemp. 6 (2013) 21--23]. In this paper, we prove that Johnson graphs are paired 2-coverable. Moreover, we obtain that another family of graphs $QJ(n,k)$ constructed from Johnson graphs by Alspach are also paired 2-coverable.</description>

      <title>Trees with extremal Laplacian eigenvalue multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree. Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of $T$ with multiplicity $m_{T}(\lambda)$. It is known that $m_{T}(\lambda) \leq p(T)-1$, where $p(T)$ is the number of pendant vertices of $T$. In this paper, we characterize all trees $T$ for which there exists an eigenvalue $\lambda$ such that $m_{T}(\lambda)=p(T)-1$. We show that such trees are precisely either paths, or there exists an integer $q$ such that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two distinct pendant vertices, then the distance $d(\alpha,\beta)$ satisfies $d(\alpha, \beta) \equiv 2q ~{\rm{mod}}~(2q+1)$. As a consequence, we show that $1$ is an eigenvalue of $L_T$ with multiplicity $p(T)-1$ if and only if $d(\alpha,\beta) \equiv 2\,\mbox{mod}\, 3$ for all distinct pendant vertices $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of $T$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ward numbers $W(n,k)$ combinatorially enumerate set partitions with block sizes $\geq 2$ and phylogenetic trees (total partition trees). We prove that $W(n,k)$ also counts \emph{increasing Schr\"oder trees} by verifying they satisfy Ward's recurrence. We construct a direct type-preserving bijection between total partition trees and increasing Schr\"oder trees, complementing known type-preserving bijections to set partitions (including Chen's decomposition for increasing Schr\"oder trees). Weighted generalizations extend these bijections to enriched increasing Schr\"oder trees trees and Schr\"oder trees trees, yielding new links to labeled rooted trees. Finally, we deduce a functional equation for weighted increasing Schr\"oder trees, whose solution using Chen's decomposition leads to a combinatorial interpretation of a Lagrange inversion variant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser recently considered a family of binomial determinants. In this work, we give combinatorial interpretations of two subclasses of these determinants in terms of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths, thereby partially answering a question of theirs. Furthermore, the determinant evaluations established by Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser produce many product formulas for our weighted enumerations of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths. However, there are still two enumerations left corresponding to conjectural formulas made by the three. We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Color-constrained Paths in Semicomplete Multipartite Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every semicomplete multipartite digraph contains a quasi-Hamiltonian path, but the problem of finding a quasi-Hamiltonian path with prescribed start and end vertex is NP-complete even when restricted to semicomplete multipartite digraphs with independence number exactly 3. Bang-Jensen, Wang and Yeo (arXiv 2024) showed that deciding the presence of a quasi-Hamiltonian cycle which does not contain at least one vertex from each color class is NP-complete. Similarly, deciding the presence of a quasi-Hamiltonian cycle which intersects every part exactly once is also NP-complete as shown in the same work.
  In this paper, we continue the study of paths with constraints on the number of covered vertices from each color class. We consider the problem of finding a path with prescribed start and end vertex that contains at least $a$ and at most $b$ vertices from each color class where all color classes have size exactly $\alpha$. This unifies the Hamiltonian path problem, the quasi-Hamiltonian path problem and the path-version of the cycle problems mentioned above, among other problems. Using Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, we classify the complexity of almost all problems in our framework. Notable open problems are the Hamiltonian path problem on semicomplete multipartite digraphs as well as the quasi-Hamiltonian path problem restricted to semicomplete multipartite digraphs with independence number 2.
  We then investigate the quasi-Hamiltonian path problem restricted to semicomplete multipartite digraphs with independence number 2. We generalize sufficient criteria for Hamiltonian $(s,t)$-paths in semicomplete digraphs to sufficient criteria for quasi-Hamiltonian $(s,t)$-paths in this class. Although this does not settle the problem, the initial results suggest that this special case may be solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s's unit distance problem and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to a classical result of Spencer, Szemer\'edi, and Trotter (1984), the maximum number of times the unit distance can occur among $n$ points in the plane is $O(n^{4/3})$. This is far from Erd\H{o}s's lower bound, $n^{1+O(1/\log\log n)}$, which is conjectured to be optimal. We prove a structural result for point sets with nearly $n^{4/3}$ unit distances and use it to reduce the problem to a conjecture on rigid frameworks. This conjecture, if true, would yield the first improvement on the bound of Spencer et al. A weaker version of this conjecture has been established by the last two authors.</description>

      <title>Sidorenko-Type Inequalities for Even Subdivisions over Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sidorenko's conjecture asserts that every bipartite graph $H$ has the property that, for any host graph $G$, the homomorphism density from $H$ to $G$ is asymptotically at least as large as in a quasirandom graph with the same edge density as $G$. While the conjecture remains still very open, Szegedy showed that it suffices to verify the inequality when the host graph is a Cayley graph over a finite group.
  In this paper, we prove that Sidorenko's conjecture holds for all even subdivisions of arbitrary graphs when the host graph is a Cayley graph over an abelian group. That is, if each edge of a graph is replaced by a path of even length (allowing different lengths for different edges), then the resulting graph satisfies the Sidorenko's inequality in any abelian Cayley host graph.
  Our approach reduces the homomorphism count to the evaluation of certain averages over solution sets of linear systems over finite abelian groups, and proceeds using Fourier-analytic techniques.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic normality of embedding distributions of some families of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the embedding distribution of a given graph is a fundamental question in topological graph theory. In this article, we extend our viewpoint to a sequence of graphs and consider their asymptotic embedding distributions, which are often the normal distribution. We establish the asymptotic normality of several families of graphs by developing adapted tools and frameworks. We expect that these tools and frameworks can be used on other families of graphs to establish the asymptotic normality of their embedding distributions. Several open questions and conjectures are also raised in our investigation.</description>

      <title>Sharp Square Root Bounds for Edge Eigenvector Universality in Sparse Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how eigenvectors of random regular graphs behave when projected onto fixed directions. For a random $d$-regular graph with $N$ vertices, where the degree $d$ grows slowly with $N$, we prove that these projections follow approximately normal distributions. Our main result establishes a Berry-Esseen bound showing convergence to the Gaussian with error $O(\sqrt{d} \cdot N^{-1/6+\varepsilon})$ for degrees $d \leq N^{1/4}$. This bound significantly improves upon previous results that had error terms scaling as $d^3$, and we prove our $\sqrt{d}$ scaling is optimal by establishing a matching lower bound. Our proof combines three techniques: (1) refined concentration inequalities that exploit the specific variance structure of regular graphs, (2) a vector-based analysis of the resolvent that avoids iterative procedures, and (3) a framework combining Stein's method with graph-theoretic tools to control higher-order fluctuations. These results provide sharp constants for eigenvector universality in the transition from sparse to moderately dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for moments of the minimal partition excludant in congruence classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal excludant statistic, which denotes the smallest positive integer that is not a part of an integer partition, has received great interest in recent years. In this paper, we move on to the smallest positive integer whose frequency is less than a given number. We establish an asymptotic formula for the moments of such generalized minimal excludants that fall in a specific congruence class. In particular, our estimation reveals that the moments associated with a fixed modulus are asymptotically ``equal''.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness of Expander Walks via Fourier Analysis on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One approach to study the pseudorandomness properties of walks on expander graphs is to label the vertices of an expander with elements from an alphabet $\Sigma$, and study the mean of functions over $\Sigma^n$. We say expander walks $\varepsilon$-fool a function if, for any unbiased labeling of the vertices, the expander walk mean is $\varepsilon$-close to the true mean. We show that:
  - The class of symmetric functions is $O(|\Sigma|\cdot\lambda)$-fooled by expander walks over any generic $\lambda$-expander, and any alphabet $\Sigma$ . This generalizes the result of Cohen, Peri, Ta-Shma [STOC'21] which analyzes it for $|\Sigma| =2$, and exponentially improves the previous bound of $O(|\Sigma|^{O(|\Sigma|)}\cdot \lambda)$, by Golowich and Vadhan [CCC'22]. Additionally, if the expander is a Cayley graph over $\mathbb{Z}_{|\Sigma|}$, we get a further improved bound of $O(\sqrt{|\Sigma|}\cdot\lambda)$.
  Morever, when $\Sigma$ is a finite group $G$, we show the following for functions over $G^n$:
  - The class of symmetric class functions is $O\Big({\frac{\sqrt{|G|}}{D}\cdot\lambda}\Big)$-fooled by expander walks over "structured" $\lambda$-expanders, if $G$ is $D$-quasirandom.
  - We show a lower bound of $\Omega(\lambda)$ for symmetric functions for any finite group $G$ (even for "structured" $\lambda$-expanders).
  - We study the Fourier spectrum of a class of non-symmetric functions arising from word maps, and show that they are exponentially fooled by expander walks.
  Our proof employs Fourier analysis over general groups, which contrasts with earlier works that have studied either the case of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$. This enables us to get quantitatively better bounds even for unstructured sets.</description>

      <title>Morse matchings and Khovanov homology of 4-strand torus links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a link or a tangle diagram, we define algorithmic Morse theoretic simplifications on their Khovanov homology. In contrast to Bar-Natan's scanning algorithm, the cancellations are postponed until the end and performed in one go. Although our novel approach is computationally inferior to Bar-Natan's algorithm, it side-steps the need for a large amount of iterations, making it more fitting for theoretical analysis. Our main application is towards integral Khovanov homology of 4-strand torus links, for which we compute non-trivial Khovanov homology groups in all homological degrees and find an abundance of $4$-torsion. At the limit $T(4,\infty)$, our computations agree with a conjecture of Gorsky, Oblomkov and Rasmussen. For finite $n$, we use the $\lambda$-invariant of Lewark, Marino and Zibrowius to derive lower bounds on proper rational Gordian distances from $T(4,n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the ideal of relations in the (equivariant) quantum K ring of a homogeneous space is generated by quantizations of each of the generators of the ideal in the classical (equivariant) K ring. This extends to quantum K theory a result of Siebert and Tian in quantum cohomology. We illustrate this technique in the case of the quantum K ring of partial flag manifolds, using a set of quantum K Whitney relations conjectured by the authors, and recently proved by Huq-Kuruvilla.</description>

      <title>On an entropy inequality for quadratic forms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a non-degenerate rational quadratic form. Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent $(s, C)$-Frostman random variables whose ranges are contained in $[-c_1, c_1]$, with $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $C,c_1\geq 1$. We prove that there exist a positive constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(s,\phi)$ and an integer $N=N(s,C,c_1,\phi)$ such that
  $$\max\left\{H_n(X+Y),\,H_n(\phi(X,Y))\right\} \ge n(s+\epsilon)$$
  for all $n&gt;N$. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case. As an application, we derive a result on a discretized sum-product type problem. In particular, for a $\delta$-separated set $A\subset [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$, satisfying some non-concentration conditions, there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s, \phi)&gt;0$ such that $$E_\delta(A+A) + E_\delta(\phi(A, A)) \gg\delta^{-\epsilon}(\#A) $$ for all $\delta$ small enough. Here by $E_\delta(A)$ we mean the $\delta$-covering number of $A$.</description>

      <title>The Labeled Coupon Collector Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the well-known Coupon Collector Problem (CCP) in combinatorics. Our problem is to find the minimum and expected number of draws, with replacement, required to recover $n$ distinctly labeled coupons, with each draw consisting of a random subset of $k$ different coupons and a random ordering of their associated labels. We specify two variations of the problem, Type-I in which the set of labels is known at the start, and Type-II in which the set of labels is unknown at the start. We show that our problem can be viewed as an extension of the separating system problem introduced by R\'enyi and Katona, provide a full characterization of the minimum, and provide a numerical approach to finding the expectation using a Markov chain model, with special attention given to the case where two coupons are drawn at a time.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the sum of the Picard ranks of a polar pair of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties of dimension $d\geq 3$ is at most the minimum of the number of facets and vertices of the corresponding pair of reflexive polytopes minus $(d-1)$. This is a generalization of Eikelberg's theory of affine dependences describing the Picard groups of toric varieties. The upper bound is achieved if and only if the polar pair is a simple-simplicial pair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the cohomology class of any curve on a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least 4 is an even multiple of the minimal class. The same holds for the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold. This disproves the integral Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties and shows that very general cubic threefolds are not stably rational. Our proof is motivated by tropical geometry; it relies on multivariable Mumford constructions, monodromy considerations, and the combinatorial theory of matroids.</description>

Abstract: In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$ of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ there is a unique degree $n-1$ polynomial ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</description>

      <title>Some Lagrangian quiver Grassmannians for the equioriented cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM.</description>

      <title>An ensemble of high rank matrices arising from tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.10871v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $\mathbb{F}$ is a field and let $\mathbf{a} := (a_1, a_2, \dotsc)$ be a sequence of non-zero elements in $\mathbb{F}$. For $\mathbf{a}_n := (a_1, \dotsc, a_n)$, we consider the family $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbf{a})$ of $n \times n$ symmetric matrices $M$ over $\mathbb{F}$ with all diagonal entries zero and the $(i, j)$th element of $M$ either $a_i$ or $a_j$ for $i &lt; j$. In this short paper, we show that all matrices in a certain subclass of $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbf{a})$ -- which can be naturally associated with transitive tournaments -- have rank at least $\lfloor 2n/3 \rfloor - 1$. We also show that if $\operatorname{char}(\mathbb{F}) \neq 2$ and $M$ is a matrix chosen uniformly at random from $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbf{a})$, then with high probability $\operatorname{rank}(M) \geq \bigl(\frac{1}{2} - o(1)\bigr)n$.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities Made Simpler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an alternative, simple method to prove isoperimetric inequalities over the hypercube. In particular, we show:
  1. An elementary proof of classical isoperimetric inequalities of Talagrand, as well as a stronger isoperimetric result conjectured by Talagrand and recently proved by Eldan and Gross.
  2. A strengthening of the Friedgut junta theorem, asserting that if the $p$-moment of the sensitivity of a function is constant for some $1/2 + \varepsilon\leq p\leq 1$, then the function is close to a junta. In this language, Friedgut's theorem is the special case that $p=1$.</description>

Abstract: During the study of Coxeter's friezes, M. Cuntz defined the concept of $\lambda$-quiddities and gave the problem of studying them over some subsets of $\mathbb{C}$. The objective of this text is to carry out this study in the case of some cyclic subgroups of ($\mathbb{C},+$). In particular we will study the case of the cyclic subgroups generated by $\sqrt{k}$ and $i\sqrt{k}$, with $k \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

Abstract: Discrete signatures are invariants computed from time series corresponding to the discretised version of the signature of paths. We study the algebraic varieties arising from their images, the discrete signature varieties. We introduce them and compute their dimension in many cases. From a particular subclass of these varieties, we derive a partial solution to the Chen-Chow theorem for complex-valued time series.</description>

Abstract: Topological indices are important bridge between graph theory and chemical applications. The study of graph matching expandability has been an influential topic in recent research on graph structure. In this paper, we provide some sufficient conditions for a graph to be $k$-extendable graphs, $n$-factor-critical graphs and $(n,k,d)$-graphs and graphs with prefect matching in terms of a significant type of Topological index: the Zeroth-order General Randi\'c Index ($\alpha\ge-1$ and $\alpha\neq 0$).</description>

      <title>The spectra of Laplace operators on covering simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a decomposition of the Laplace operator (in matrix form) of a covering simplicial complex as a direct sum of several matrices, one of which is the Laplace operator of the base complex. It follows that the spectrum of a covering simplicial complex is a multiset union of the spectrum of the base simplicial complex and the spectra of other relevant matrices, which implies the spectral inclusion property of Horak and Jost. In the case of a $2$-fold covering, we show that the spectrum is a multiset union of the spectrum of the base complex and that of an incidence-signed simplicial complex, thereby generalizing a result of Bilu and Linial from graphs to simplicial complexes. Additionally, we show that the dimension of the cohomology of a covering complex is greater than or equal to that of the base complex. Our arguments exploit the coverings of incidence graphs of simplicial complexes and the representation theory of permutation groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the seminal work of Stanley, several conjectures were made on the structure of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for the multiplication of Jack symmetric functions. Motivated by recent results of Alexandersson and the present author, we postulate that a `windowing' property holds for all such Jack L-R coefficients. Furthermore, we propose an extension of the `Factorization' property for Schur L-R due to King-Tollu-Toumazet to the Jack case. These properties provide a vast set of relations between the Jack L-R coefficients and allow for their direct computation in a certain large class of cases.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the independence and chromatic numbers of locally sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we consider a more general version of local sparsity introduced recently by Anderson, Kuchukova, and the author. In particular, we say a graph $G = (V, E)$ is $(k, r)$-locally-sparse if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by its neighborhood contains at most $k$ cliques of size $r$. For $r \geq 3$ and $\epsilon \in [0, 1]$, we show that an $n$-vertex $(\Delta^{\epsilon r}, r)$-locally-sparse graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies $\alpha(G) \geq (1-o(1))\dfrac{n}{\eta\Delta}$ and $\chi(G) \leq \Theta\left(\eta\Delta\right)$, where $\eta := \epsilon + \dfrac{r\log\log \Delta}{\log \Delta}$. For $\epsilon$ not too large, the hidden constant in the $\Theta(\cdot)$ can be taken to be $1+o(1)$. Setting $\epsilon = 0$, we recover classical results on $K_{r+1}$-free graphs due to Shearer and Johansson, which were more recently improved by Davies, Kang, Pirot, and Sereni. We prove a stronger result on the independence number in terms of the occupancy fraction in the hard-core model, and establish a local version of the coloring result in the more general setting of correspondence coloring.</description>

      <title>Connections Between Combinations Without Specified Separations and Strongly Restricted Permutations, Compositions, and Bit Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ and $S_{n,k}$ be, respectively, the number of subsets and $k$-subsets of $\mathbb{N}_n=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that no two subset elements differ by an element of the set $\mathcal{Q}$, the largest element of which is $q$. We prove a bijection between such $k$-subsets when $\mathcal{Q}=\{m,2m,\ldots,jm\}$ with $j,m&gt;0$ and permutations $\pi$ of $\mathbb{N}_{n+jm}$ with $k$ excedances satisfying $\pi(i)-i\in\{-m,0,jm\}$ for all $i\in\mathbb{N}_{n+jm}$. We also identify a bijection between another class of restricted permutation and the cases $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,q\}$ and derive the generating function for $S_n$ when $q=4,5,6$. We give some classes of $\mathcal{Q}$ for which $S_n$ is also the number of compositions of $n+q$ into a given set of allowed parts. We also prove a bijection between $k$-subsets for a class of $\mathcal{Q}$ and the set representations of size $k$ of equivalence classes for the occurrence of a given length-($q+1$) subword within bit strings. We then formulate a straightforward procedure for obtaining the generating function for the number of such equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Perfect coalition in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \noindent A perfect dominating set in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $S \subseteq V$ such that each vertex in $V \setminus S$ has exactly one neighbor in $S$. A perfect coalition in $G$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ such that i) neither $V_i$ nor $V_j$ is a dominating set, ii) each vertex in $V(G) \setminus V_i$ has at most one neighbor in $V_i$ and each vertex in $V(G) \setminus V_j$ has at most one neighbor in $V_j$, and iii) $V_i \cup V_j$ is a perfect dominating set. A perfect coalition partition (abbreviated $prc$-partition) in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi= \lbrace V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_k \rbrace$ such that for each set $V_i$ of $\pi$ either $V_i$ is a singleton dominating set, or there exists a set $V_j \in \pi$ that forms a perfect coalition with $V_i$. In this paper, we initiate the study of perfect coalition partitions in graphs. We obtain a bound on the number of perfect coalitions involving each member of a perfect coalition partition, in terms of maximum degree. The perfect coalition of some special graphs are investigated. The graph $G$ with $\delta(G)=1$, the triangle-free graphs $G$ with prefect coalition number of order of $G$ and the trees $T$ with prefect coalition number in $\{n,n-1,n-2\}$ where $n=|V(T)|$ are characterized.</description>

      <title>Integer and Unsplittable Multiflows in Series-Parallel Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An unsplittable multiflow routes the demand of each commodity along a single path from its source to its sink node. As our main result, we prove that in series-parallel digraphs, any given multiflow can be expressed as a convex combination of unsplittable multiflows, where the total flow on any arc deviates from the given flow by less than the maximum demand of any commodity. This result confirms a 25-year-old conjecture by Goemans for single-source unsplittable flows, as well as a stronger recent conjecture by Morell and Skutella, for series-parallel digraphs - even for general multiflow instances where commodities have distinct source and sink nodes. Previously, no non-trivial class of digraphs was known for which either conjecture holds. En route to proving this result, we also establish strong integrality results for multiflows on series-parallel digraphs, showing that their computation can be reduced to a simple single-commodity network flow problem.</description>

Abstract: Aougab and Gaster [Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos.

We determine the maximum size of such a set for every k. In particular, the maximum never exceeds k+6, and it does not exceed k+4 when k is large.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Lehmer codes, with immersions in the Bruhat order, for several finite Coxeter groups, including all the classical Weyl groups. This allows to associate to each lower Bruhat interval of these groups a multicomplex whose f-polynomial is the Poincar\'e polynomial of the interval. Via a general construction, we prove that these polynomials are h-polynomials of vertex-decomposable simplicial complexes. Moreover we provide a classification, in terms of unimodal permutations, of Poincar\'e polynomials of smooth Schubert varieties in flag manifolds.</description>

      <title>Permutation-based Strategies for Labeled Chip-Firing on $k$-ary Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chip-firing is a combinatorial game on a graph, in which chips are placed and dispersed among its vertices until a stable configuration is achieved. We specifically study a chip-firing variant on an infinite, rooted, directed $k$-ary tree where we place $k^n$ chips labeled $0,1,\dots, k^n-1$ on the root for some nonnegative integer $n$, and we say a vertex $v$ can fire if it has at least $k$ chips. When a vertex fires, we select $k$ labeled chips and send the $i$th smallest chip among them to its $i$th leftmost child. A stable configuration is reached when no vertex can fire. In this paper, we focus on stable configurations resulting from specific firing strategies based on permutations of $1, 2, \dots, n$. We then express the stable configuration as a permutation of $0,1, 2, \dots, k^n-1$ and explore its properties, such as the number of inversions and descents.</description>

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of triplets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). We show that in $\mathbb{C}^d$ each MUB-triplet is characterized by a $d\times d\times d$ object that we call a Hadamard cube. We describe the basic properties of Hadamard cubes, and show how an MUB-triplet can be reconstructed from such a cube, up to unitary equivalence.
  We also present an algebraic identity which is conjectured to hold for all MUB-triplets in dimension 6. If true, it would imply the long-standing conjecture of Zauner that the maximum number of MUBs in dimension 6 is three.</description>

      <title>An algebraic characterization for spectral radii of trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been various results on spectral radii of trees, studying the relations between spectral radius $\lambda(T)$ of a tree $T$ and some other parameters of $T$. In this article, we provide an algebraic characterization for the spectral radii of trees, and apply this new result to study the existence of trees with given spectral radius and maximum degree.
  For any positive integer $r$ and positive number $\alpha$, let ${\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$ denote the set defined recursively: $\alpha\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$, and for any multi-set $\{q_i\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha): q_i&gt;0, 1\le i\le s\}$, if $\beta:=\alpha \sum\limits_{i=1}^sq_i^{-1}\ge 0$ and $s\le r-\left \lceil \frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right\rceil$, then $\beta \in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$. We first show that for any positive integer $r$ and real number $\alpha\ge 1$, there exists a tree $T$ with maximum degree $\Delta(T)\le r$ and spectral radius $\lambda(T)=\alpha$ if and only if $0\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$. It follows that the set of spectral radii of non-trivial trees is exactly the set of positive numbers $\alpha$ such that $0\in {\mathscr W}_{\lfloor\alpha^2\rfloor}(\alpha)$. Applying this conclusion, we then prove that for any positive integers $r\ge 2$ and $k$, there exists a tree $T$ with $\Delta(T)=r$ and $\lambda(T)=\sqrt k$ if and only if $\frac 14 k+1&lt;r\le k$.</description>

      <title>Max-Bisections of graphs without even cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an integer $k\ge 2$, let $G$ be a graph with $m$ edges and without cycles of length $2k$. The pivotal Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov Theorem on Max-Cuts states that $G$ has a bipartite subgraph with at least $m/2+\Omega(m^{(2k+1)/(2k+2)})$ edges. In this paper, we present a bisection variant of it by showing that if $G$ has minimum degree at least $k$, then $G$ has a balanced bipartite subgraph with at least $m/2+\Omega(m^{(2k+1)/(2k+2)})$ edges. It not only answers a problem of Fan, Hou and Yu in full generality but also enhances a recent result given by Hou, Wu and Zhong.
  Our approach hinges on a key bound for bisections of graphs with sparse neighborhoods concerning the degree sequence. The result is inspired by the celebrated approximation algorithm of Goemans and Williamson and appears to be worthy of future exploration.</description>

      <title>On Structural Properties and Adjacency Spectrum of Coprime Graph of Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $TCG_n$ denote the coprime graph having vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with any two vertices $i,j$ being adjacent if and only if $\gcd(i,j)=1$. In this article, we first study some structural properties of $TCG_n$. We study the vertex connectivity and crossing number of the coprime graph of integers. We discover a lower constraint on the multiplicity of $-1$, which appears as an eigenvalue in the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$. We demonstrate our findings with a variety of cases. We also show that the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$ is singular, i.e. has determinant $0$. Furthermore, we give a lower bound on the multiplicity of $0$, which appears as an eigenvalue in the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$. Finally, we establish that the greatest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$ is always above $2.$</description>

Abstract: The well-known descent-to-peak map $\Theta_{\mathrm{QSym}}$ for the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions, $\mathrm{QSym}$, and the peak algebra $\Pi$ were originally defined by Stembridge in 1997. We define the labelled descent-to-peak map $\Theta_{\mathrm{NCQSym}}$ and extend the notion of the peak algebra to noncommuting variables. Moreover, we define Schur $Q$-functions in noncommuting variables having properties analogous to the classical Schur $Q$-functions.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Formula for Vertex Enumeration in the CUT(n) Polytope via Probabilistic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit closed-form formula for the vertices of the classical cut polytope $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, defined as the convex hull of cut vectors of the complete graph $K_n$. Our derivation proceeds via a related polytope, denoted $\mathbf{1}$-$\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, whose vertices are obtained by flipping all bits of the $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$ vertices. This polytope arises naturally in a probabilistic context involving agreement probabilities among symmetric Bernoulli random variables which serves as the starting point of this work.
  Our approach constructs the vertex set recursively via a binary encoding that stems from this probabilistic perspective. We prove that the resulting sequence of encoded integers, when appropriately scaled, exhibits an almost-linear behavior closely approximating the line $y = x - \frac{1}{2}$. This structure motivates the introduction of the alternating cycle function, an integer-valued map whose key property is power-of-two composition invariance. The function serves as the foundation for our closed-form enumeration formula.
  The result provides a rare instance of explicit vertex characterization for a $0$/$1$-polytope and offers a transparent combinatorial construction independent of enumeration algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Induced Saturation Number for $\mathcal{V}_3$ is Linear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a poset $\mathcal{P}$, a family $\mathcal{F}$ of elements in the Boolean lattice is said to be $\mathcal{P}$-saturated if $\mathcal{F}$ does not contain an induced copy $\mathcal P$, but every proper superset of $\mathcal{F}$ contains one. The minimum size of a $\mathcal P$-saturated family in the $n$-dimensional Boolean lattice is denoted by $sat^*(n,\mathcal{P})$.\par In this paper, we consider the poset $\mathcal V_3$ (the four element poset with one minimal element and three incomparable maximal elements) and show that $sat^*(n,\mathcal{V}_3)\geq \frac{n}{2}$. This represents the first linear lower bound for $sat^*(n,\mathcal{V}_3)$, improving upon the previously best-known bound of $2\sqrt{n}$. Our result establishes that $sat^*(n,\mathcal{V}_3) = \Theta(n)$.</description>

      <title>Doubly transitive equiangular tight frames that contain regular simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An equiangular tight frame (ETF) is a finite sequence of equal norm vectors in a Hilbert space that achieves equality in the Welch bound, and so has minimal coherence. The binder of an ETF is the set of all subsets of its indices whose corresponding vectors form a regular simplex. An ETF achieves equality in Donoho and Elad's spark bound if and only if its binder is nonempty. When this occurs, its binder is the set of all linearly dependent subsets of it of minimal size. Moreover, if members of the binder form a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) then its incidence matrix can be phased to produce a sparse representation of its dual (Naimark complement). A few infinite families of ETFs are known to have this remarkable property. In this paper, we relate this property to the recently introduced concept of a doubly transitive equiangular tight frame (DTETF), namely an ETF for which the natural action of its symmetry group is doubly transitive. In particular, we show that the binder of any DTETF is either empty or forms a BIBD, and moreover that when the latter occurs, any member of the binder of its dual is an oval of this BIBD. We then apply this general theory to certain known infinite families of DTETFs. Specifically, any symplectic form on a finite vector space yields a DTETF, and we compute the binder of it and its dual, showing that the former is empty except in a single notable case, and that the latter consists of affine Lagrangian subspaces. This unifies and generalizes several results from the existing literature. We then consider the binders of four infinite families of DTETFs that arise from quadratic forms over the field of two elements, showing that two of these are empty except in a finite number of cases, whereas the other two form BIBDs that relate to each other, and to Lagrangian subspaces, in nonobvious ways.</description>

      <title>Uniform finite presentation for groups of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative refinement of the statement that groups of polynomial growth are finitely presented. Let $G$ be a group with finite generating set $S$ and let $\operatorname{Gr}(r)$ be the volume of the ball of radius $r$ in the associated Cayley graph. For each $k \geq 0$, let $R_k$ be the set of words of length at most $2^k$ in the free group $F_S$ that are equal to the identity in $G$, and let $\langle \langle R_k \rangle\rangle$ be the normal subgroup of $F_S$ generated by $R_k$, so that the quotient map $F_S/\langle\langle R_k\rangle\rangle \to G$ induces a covering map of the associated Cayley graphs that has injectivity radius at least $2^{k-1}-1$. Given a non-negative integer $k$, we say that $(G,S)$ has a new relation on scale k if $\langle\langle R_{k+1} \rangle\rangle \neq \langle\langle R_{k} \rangle\rangle$. We prove that for each $K&lt;\infty$ there exist constants $n_0$ and $C$ depending only on $K$ and $|S|$ such that if $\operatorname{Gr}(3n)\leq K \operatorname{Gr}(n)$ for some $n\geq n_0$, then there exist at most $C$ scales $k\geq \log_2 (n)$ on which $G$ has a new relation. We apply this result in a forthcoming paper as part of our proof of Schramm's locality conjecture in percolation theory.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>Long induced paths and forbidden patterns: Polylogarithmic bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a graph $G$ with a long path $P$. When is it the case that $G$ also contains a long induced path? This question has been investigated in general as well as within a number of different graph classes since the 80s. We have recently observed in a companion paper (Long induced paths in sparse graphs and graphs with forbidden patterns, arXiv:2411.08685, 2024) that most existing results can recovered in a simple way by considering forbidden ordered patterns of edges along the path $P$. In particular we proved that if we forbid some fixed ordered matching along a path of order $n$ in a graph $G$, then $G$ must contain an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$. Moreover, we completely characterized the forbidden ordered patterns forcing the existence of an induced path of polynomial size.
  The purpose of the present paper is to completely characterize the ordered patterns $H$ such that forbidding $H$ along a path $P$ of order $n$ implies the existence of an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$. These patterns are star forests with some specific ordering, which we called constellations.
  As a direct consequence of our result, we show that if a graph $G$ has a path of length $n$ and does not contain $K_t$ as a topological minor, then $G$ contains an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1/t \log^2 t)}$. The previously best known bound was $(\log n)^{f(t)}$ for some unspecified function $f$ depending on the Topological Minor Structure Theorem of Grohe and Marx (2015).</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of real algebraic functions into curves with prescribed Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss reconstructing smooth real algebraic maps onto curves whose Reeb graph is as prescribed. This can be contributed to real algebraic geometry, especially in explicit examples in real algebraic geometry in a new way. The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of all single points and a natural quotient space of the manifold with the vertex set being all connected components containing some singular points of it. This gives a strong tool in geometry of manifolds and appeared already in 1950 with Morse functions.
  The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least 2 is a graph with exactly two vertices and one edge. We reconstruct functions, from general finite graphs, conversely. In the differentiable situations, Sharko pioneered this in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki and Michalak, mainly. Related real algebraic situations have been launched and studied by the author. The curve-valued case is first considered here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:math/0405083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give two expressions for tau(n+1) in terms of the sum-of divisors function. One is a determinant, from which we fashion a condition equivalent to the non-vanishing of tau(n+1). The other is a sum over partitions, which we interpret it in terms of automorphisms of the graphs attached to them. We build a matrix from the initial values of tau, and show that it is non-singular.</description>
