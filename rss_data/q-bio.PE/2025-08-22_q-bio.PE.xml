      <title>Yeast growth is controlled by the proportional scaling of mRNA and ribosome concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growth being fundamental to all aspects of cell biology, we do not yet know its organizing principles in eukaryotic cells. Classic models derived from the bacteria E. coli posit that protein-synthesis rates are set by mass-action collisions between charged tRNAs produced by metabolic enzymes and mRNA-bound ribosomes. These models show that faster growth is achieved by simultaneously raising both ribosome content and peptide elongation speed. Here, we test if these models are valid for eukaryotes by combining single-molecule tracking, spike-in RNA sequencing, and proteomics in 15 carbon- and nitrogen-limited conditions using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Ribosome concentration increases linearly with growth rate, as in bacteria, but the peptide elongation speed remains constant (~9 amino acids/s) and charged tRNAs are not limiting. Total mRNA concentration rises in direct proportion to ribosomes, driven by enhanced RNA polymerase II occupancy of the genome. We show that a simple kinetic model of mRNA-ribosome binding predicts both the fraction of active ribosomes, the growth rate, and responses to transcriptional perturbations. Yeast accelerate growth by coordinately and proportionally co-up-regulating total mRNA and ribosome concentrations, not by speeding elongation. Taken together, our work establishes a new framework for eukaryotic growth control and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Modelling the transmission and impact of Omicron variants of Covid-19 in different ethnicity groups in Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous pandemics, including influenza pandemics and Covid-19, have disproportionately impacted M\=aori and Pacific populations in Aotearoa New Zealand. The reasons for this are multi-faceted, including differences in socioeconomic deprivation, housing conditions and household size, vaccination rates, access to healthcare, and prevalence of pre-existing health conditions. Many mathematical models that were used to inform the response to the Covid-19 pandemic did not explicitly include ethnicity or other socioeconomic variables. This limited their ability to predict, understand and mitigate inequitable impacts of the pandemic. Here, we extend a model that was developed during the Covid-19 pandemic to support the public health response by stratifying the population into four ethnicity groups: M\=aori, Pacific, Asian and European/other. We include three ethnicity-specific components in the model: vaccination rates, clinical severity parameters, and contact patterns. We compare model results to ethnicity-specific data on Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths between 1 January 2022 and 30 June 2023, under different model scenarios in which these ethnicity-specific components are present or absent. We find that differences in vaccination rates explain only part of the observed disparities in outcomes. While no model scenario is able to fully capture the heterogeneous temporal dynamics, our results suggest that differences between ethnicities in the per-infection risk of clinical severe disease is an important factor. Our work is an important step towards models that are better able to predict inequitable impacts of future pandemic and emerging disease threats, and investigate the ability of interventions to mitigate these.</description>

      <title>Defining a phylogenetic tree with the minimum number of small-state characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees represent evolutionary relationships and can be uniquely defined by sets of finite-state biological characteristics. Despite prior work showing that sufficiently large trees can be determined by $r$-state character sets, the minimal leaf thresholds $n_r$ remain largely unknown. In this work, we establish the 3-state case as $n_3 = 8$, providing a concrete base for higher-state analyses. We then resolve the 5-state problem by constructing a counterexample for $n=15$ and proving that for $n \geq 16$, $\lceil (n-3)/4 \rceil$ 5-state characters suffice to uniquely define any tree. Our approach relies on rigorous mathematical induction with complete verification of base cases and logically consistent inductive steps, offering new insights into the minimal conditions for character-based tree identification.</description>

      <title>Beyond Traditional Surveillance: Harnessing Expert Knowledge for Public Health Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downsizing the US public health workforce throughout 2025 amplifies potential risks during public health crises. Expert judgment from public health officials represents a vital information source, distinct from traditional surveillance infrastructure, that should be valued -- not discarded. Understanding how expert knowledge functions under constraints is essential for understanding the potential impact of reduced capacity. To explore expert forecasting capabilities, 114 public health officials at the 2024 CSTE workshop generated 103 predictions plus 102 rationales of peak hospitalizations and 114 predictions of influenza H3 versus H1 dominance in Pennsylvania for the 2024/25 season. We compared expert predictions to computational models and used rationales to analyze reasoning patterns using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experts better predicted H3 dominance and assigned lower probability to implausible scenarios than models. Expert rationales drew on historical patterns, pathogen interactions, vaccine data, and cumulative experience. Expert public health knowledge constitutes a critical data source that should be valued equally with traditional datasets. We recommend developing a national toolkit to systematically collect and analyze expert predictions and rationales, treating human judgment as quantifiable data alongside surveillance systems to enhance crisis response capabilities.</description>

      <title>Spatial Super-Infection and Co-Infection Dynamics in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding interactions between the spread of multiple pathogens during an epidemic is crucial to assessing the severity of infections in human communities. In this paper, we introduce two new Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion models (MBRD) on multiplex metapopulation networks: the super-infection model (MBRD-SI) and the co-infection model (MBRD-CI). These frameworks capture two-pathogen dynamics with spatial diffusion and cross-diffusion, allowing the prediction of infection clustering and large-scale spatial distributions. We establish conditions for Turing and Turing-Hopf instabilities in both models and provide experimental evidence of epidemic pattern formation. Beyond epidemiology, we discuss applications of the MBRD framework to information propagation, malware diffusion, and urban transportation networks.</description>

      <title>A theory of ecological invasions and its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.</description>
