      <title>FRB 20200428 and potentially associated hard X-ray bursts: Maser emission and synchrotron radiation of electrons in a weakly magnetized plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal and spatial coincidence between FRB 20200428 and hard peaks of the X-ray burst from SGR 1935+2154 suggests their potential association. We attributed them to the plasma synchrotron maser emission and synchrotron radiation of electrons in weakly magnetized, relativistically moving plasma blobs, and Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows that our model can predict observable fast radio burst outbursts and associated hard X-ray bursts with current telescopes. We constrained the properties of the blobs, including the Lorentz factor $\Gamma=5-30$, the magnetization factor $\sigma=6\times10^{-5}\sim 2\times 10^{-4}$, the electron Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\rm e,s}=(1.8-3.3)\times10^4$, and the plasma frequency $\nu_P=2.48 -42.61$ MHz. The inferred size of the blobs is $\sim 10^{9-10}$ cm, and it is located $\sim 10^{12-14}$ cm from the central engine. By adopting fine-tuned parameter sets, the observed spectra of both the FRB 20200428 outbursts and X-ray bursts can be well represented. The peak flux density ($F_{\rm\nu_{ pk}}$) of plasma maser emission is sensitive to $\sigma$ and $\nu_P$. Variation in $F_{\rm \nu_{pk}}$ can be more than 10 orders of magnitude, while the flux density of the synchrotron emission only varies by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This can account for the observed sub-energetic radio bursts or giant radio pulses from SGR 1935+2154.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GammaPBHPlotter, a public Python code for calculating and plotting the Hawking radiation gamma-ray spectra of primordial black holes in the mass range of $10^{14}$ to $10^{18}$ grams. This tool allows users to compute the monochromatic and mass-averaged spectra of black holes over a range of parameters. We include the primary/direct Hawking emission, the secondary emission from the decay and hadronization of unstable particles, the final state radiation, and the in-flight annihilation gamma-ray emission components.</description>

      <title>Exploring the astrophysical origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of gravitational-wave detections from binary black holes enables increasingly precise measurements of their population properties. The observed population is most likely drawn from multiple formation channels. Population-synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of each of these channels, and comparing population-synthesis models with the observations allows us to constrain the uncertain physics of binary black hole formation and evolution. However, the most detailed population-synthesis codes are computationally expensive. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate five different population synthesis models, reducing the computational expense, and allowing interpolation between the populations predicted for different simulation inputs. With the trained normalising flows, we measure the branching ratios of different formation channels and details of binary stellar evolution, using the current catalogue of gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Configurations in Binary Neutron Star Mergers II: Inspiral, Merger and Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a series of simulations of magnetised Binary Neutron Star mergers, with varying magnetic field topologies in the initial data, as well as varying Equations of State, and mass ratios. In this paper, a companion paper to arXiv:2506.18995, we analyse the impact of the initial field configuration on the gravitational wave signal, the amplification of the magnetic field, and the ejected material. We investigate the dependence of the phase evolution of the gravitational wave in the post-merger on the initial magnetic field, finding that dephasing between the $(\ell=2,m=2)$ mode of the gravitational wave, and the $(2,1)$ and $(3,3)$ modes may be strongly impacted by the numerical reconstruction scheme. The magnetic field amplification during the Kelvin-Helmholtz dominated phase may be considerably enhanced by anti-aligned fields, or suppressed by toroidal fields. The post-merger amplification of the field due to winding may be suppressed by toroidal fields, and enhanced by asymmetries or mixtures of poloidal and toroidal fields. The field strength in the ejecta may be impacted by the initial magnetic field, with configurations which lead to large amplifications and those with mixtures of poloidal and toroidal fields preferentially emitting highly magnetised material in the polar regions, showing a weaker dependence of the magnetic field on the density of the ejecta than in cases that amplify the magnetic field less. We find that the magnetic field is largely randomly oriented in the ejected material, supporting such models used to estimate thermalisation timescales of ejected material. We find that configurations which begin with an initial bitant symmetry break this symmetry uniformly, independent of the initial configuration, when evolved without an enforced symmetry. This behaviour suggests the presence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking bifurcation in the solution.</description>

      <title>A Linearly Polarized Merger Shock Down to 550 MHz: A uGMRT Study of the Merging Cluster Abell 746</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio relics, arc-like polarized sources with highly aligned magnetic fields, are typically found on the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. The magneto-ionic media responsible for the significant coherence observed in radio relics remain poorly understood. Low-frequency measurements of radio relics are essential for constraining depolarization models, which provide crucial insights into the magnetic field distribution. However, these measurements are challenging due to the emission properties and interferometer systematics. We have detected polarization signals from the northwest radio relic in Abell 746 at 650 MHz with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, marking the first-ever detection of polarisation from radio relics below 1 GHz. At this frequency, the average Rotation Measure (RM) corrected magnetic fields align well with shock radio emission, typical of radio relics. The fractional polarization at 650 MHz is $\sim 18\pm4 \%$. Our results indicate that a single internal depolarization model cannot explain the observed depolarization spectra, suggesting a non-uniform magnetic field distribution or complex contribution of different polarized regions in the radio relic. Our detection of polarization signals at 650 MHz reveals critical insights into radio relic magnetic field structures, offering a low-frequency approach to understanding ICM magnetic fields in merging galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Sensitive Constraints on Coherent Radio Emission from Five Isolated White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent, periodic radio emission from pulsars has been widely interpreted as evidence of neutron stars as strongly magnetized compact objects. In recent years, radio pulses have also been detected from white dwarfs (WDs) in tight binary systems, raising the question of whether isolated WDs could similarly host pulsar-like emission. We conducted the most sensitive search to date for coherent radio signals from five isolated, rapidly rotating, and magnetized WDs, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). No pulsed or continuum radio emission was detected down to $\mu$Jy levels. These non-detections place the most stringent observational constraints yet on the existence of isolated WD pulsars. Our results suggest that either such emission is intrinsically weak, narrowly beamed, or requires binary-induced magnetospheric interactions absent in solitary systems. Comparison with the known radio-emitting WDs highlights the critical role of companion interaction in enabling detectable emission. This work expands on prior surveys by targeting sources with the most favorable physical conditions for WD pulsar-like activity and employing highly sensitive, targeted observations. Future observations with next-generation facilities such as the SKA will be essential to explore fainter or sporadic emission from massive, magnetic WDs and to investigate their potential as compact radio transients further.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Microlensing of the Galactic Centre $\gamma$-Ray Excess: A New Test for Point-Like or Extended Emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a potential test of the origin of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass objects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between the possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from more prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an astrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small, currently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother emission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of gravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass lenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the size of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in the emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\gamma$-ray emission from dark matter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we find that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly greater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\gamma$-ray detectors. For a small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude increase in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events remaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would occur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a four-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a definitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove useful in determining the properties of any point-like source population.</description>

      <title>On the optical emission in the mini-outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study on the mini-outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 to investigate the origin of its optical emission. Using the X-ray data from Insight-HXMT and the optical observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory, we find a powerlaw correlation between the optical and X-ray fluxes with slopes of about 0.4, indicating a hybrid contribution to the optical emission from both viscously heated disk and irradiation of the outer disk illuminated by the inner X-ray emission, but inconsistent with jet-dominated optical emission. Time delay analysis shows that the optical emission precedes the X-ray by about 8.5 days, which can be naturally interpreted by the disk instability model (DIM). Meanwhile, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with an irradiated disk model successfully reproduces the observed optical and X-ray emission, with negligible contribution from the jet. The color-magnitude diagram further supports the disk-dominated optical origin of MAXI J1348-630 during its mini-outburst. Our results suggest that the DIM plays a central role in understanding mini-outbursts of X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>On Ultra-long Period (53.8 min) Pulsar ASKAP J1935+2148: Coherent Radio Emission Triggered by Local Superstrong Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eight ultra-long period pulsars (ULPPs) in radio bands have been discovered recently, e.g., ASKAP J1935+2148 with a spin period of 53.8\,min, which are much longer than those of normal pulsars, spanning from 0.016\,s to 23.5\,s, however the origins, spin evolutions and emission mechanisms of these sources are still puzzling. We investigate how the ultra-long period of ASKAP J1935+2148 is evolved by the braking of relativistic particle wind, in a time scale of about 0.1 - 1 Myr, from a normal pulsar with local superstrong magnetic fields. In addition, it is noticed that the ULPPs in the period versus period derivative diagram are much below the ``death line", implying their different characteristics from the normal pulsars. Five sources (including ASKAP J1935+2148) in total eight ULPPs share the rotational energy loss rates to be lower than their respective radio emission luminosities, a phenomenon that can be accounted for by the sustainable radio bursts induced through the reconnection of locally concentrated magnetic field lines.The diversity and complexity of ULPP radio emissions should be closely related to the presence of magnetic reconnection rather than rotational powered discharges in the gaps. Furthermore, it is suggested that the coherent radio emissions of pulsars may have two origins, one from the rotation-powered electric voltage that accounts for the normal pulsar phenomena and the other from the magnetic reconnection-induced continual radio bursts that account for the ULPP observations.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for the Supermassive Black Hole Binary in 3C 66B with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sub-parsec supermassive black hole binary at the center of the galaxy 3C 66B is a promising candidate for continuous gravitational wave searches with Pulsar Timing Arrays. In this work, we search for such a signal in the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Matching our priors to estimates of binary parameters from electromagnetic observations, we find log Bayes factor of 0.22, highlighting that the source can be neither confirmed nor ruled out. We place upper limits at 95% credibility on the chirp mass $M &lt; 6.05 \times 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$, and on the characteristic strain amplitude $\textrm{log}_{10}(h_0)&lt; -14.44$. This partially rules out the parameter space suggested by electromagnetic observations of 3C 66B. We also independently reproduce the calculation of the chirp mass with the 3-mm flux monitor data from the unresolved core of 3C 66B. Based on this, we outline a new methodology for constructing a joint likelihood of electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data from supermassive black hole binaries. Finally, we suggest that firmly established SMBHB candidates may be treated as standard sirens for complementary constraints on the universe expansion rate. With this, we obtain constraints on the Hubble constant with 3C 66B.</description>

      <title>Constraining the TeV gamma-ray emission of SN 2024bch, a possible type IIn-L from a red supergiant progenitor. Multiwavelength observations and analysis of the progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present very high-energy optical photometry and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024bch in the nearby galaxy NGC 3206 (\sim 20 Mpc). We used gamma-ray observations performed with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and optical observations with the Liverpool Telescope (LT) combined with data from public repositories to evaluate the general properties of the event and the progenitor star. No significant emission above the LST-1 energy threshold for this observation (\sim 100 GeV) was detected in the direction of SN 2024bch, and we computed an integral upper limit on the photon flux of F_\gamma(&gt;100 GeV) \le 3.61 \times 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} based on six nonconsecutive nights of observations with the LST-1, between 16 and 38 days after the explosion. Employing a general model for the gamma-ray flux emission, we found an upper limit on the mass-loss-rate to wind-velocity ratio of \dot M/u_{w} \le 10^{-4} \frac{M_\odot}{yr}\frac{s}{km}, although gamma-gamma absorption could potentially have skewed this estimation, effectively weakening our constraint. From spectro-photometric observations we found progenitor parameters of M_{pr} = 11 - 20 M_\odot and R_{pr} = 531 \pm 125 R_\odot. Finally, using archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope, we constrained the luminosity of the progenitor star to log(L_{pr}/L_\odot) \le 4.82 and its effective temperature to T_{pr} \le 4000 K. Our results suggest that SN 2024bch is a type IIn-L supernova that originated from a progenitor star consistent with a red supergiant. We show how the correct estimation of the mass-loss history of a supernova will play a major role in future multiwavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Probing Evolution of Long Gamma-Ray Burst Properties through Their Cosmic Formation History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysics of Long GRB (LGRB) progenitors as well as possible cosmological evolution in their properties still poses many open questions. Previous studies suggest that the LGRB rate density (LGRB-RD) follows the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) only at high-z and attribute this to the metallicity evolution of progenitor stars. For low z, opinions differ on whether the uptick in the LGRB RD is due to a distinct class of low-luminosity GRBs or perhaps even a different progenitor subclass. To investigate these questions, we utilize data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based observatories (redshift). To test the hypothesis that the observations can be mapped (with/without evolution) to the well-established cosmic SFRD, we consider three cases: no evolution, beaming angle evolution, and a simple power-law evolution. The comparison shows that the 'no evolution' case can be ruled out. Our study highlights that the beaming angle evolution or the simple power law evolution are also not sufficient to obtain a good match between the LGRB-RD and SFRD. Rather, the inclusion of multiple evolving properties of LGRBs in combination appears to be required to match the two rate densities in their entirety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'' corresponding to the peak of the mass distribution can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.</description>

      <title>Conformal Weyl Tensor Dynamics and Stability Analysis in Rotating Black Hole Spacetimes: A Novel Approach to Quasinormal Mode Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework for analysing the stability of rotating black hole spacetimes through the conformal properties of the Weyl tensor. By introducing a new conformal invariant constructed from the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, we derive a master equation governing perturbations that unifies the Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler- Zerilli formalisms. Our approach reveals previously unrecognised relationships between quasinormal mode frequencies and the conformal structure of the spacetime.We prove two fundamental theorems: (i) the conformal stability criterion, which relates mode stability to the sign-definiteness of our conformal invariant, and (ii) the isospectrality theorem for conformally related black hole spacetimes. Numerical calculations for Kerr black holes demonstrate that our formalism predicts new branches in the quasinormal mode spectrum, with frequencies differing from standard predictions by up to 3.7% in the near-extremal regime. These results have significant implications for gravitational wave astronomy and tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Observational bounds on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars from Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational-wave (GW) observations offer a unique opportunity to probe the fundamental nature of compact objects. A growing body of research has focused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of DM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly alter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal deformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during binary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that, for the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using real GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115, and GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\chi}$, and particle mass, $m_{\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a scalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on $F_{\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating that different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in different ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM halo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105 and GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding strong upper bounds on $F_{\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale $m_{\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to probing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations.</description>

      <title>Coincident morphological transitions in precessing black-hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new insights into the phenomenology of post-Newtonian spin precession in black-hole binaries. Using multi-timescale methods, previous work has shown that the precession and nutation dynamics in such systems can be classified into so-called spin morphologies --mutually exclusive regions that partition the configuration space and characterize the motion of the black-hole spins relative to the binary's angular momentum. Radiation reaction can induce secular transitions between different morphology classes, which are generic occurrences during the inspiral of black-hole binaries. In this contribution, we systematically explore a more restrictive class of solutions in which multiple morphological transitions occur concurrently, i.e., within the same precession cycle. We find that all such cases can be mapped and characterized analytically, and we confirm these findings through numerical integrations. These coincident transitions correspond to extreme spin configurations in black-hole binaries with potential observational signatures in gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Astrometric and polarimetric imprints of hot-spots orbiting parametrized black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the observational features of hot-spots orbiting parametrized black hole (BH) spacetimes. We select a total of four BH spacetimes, two from the Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) parametrization, and two from the Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) parametrization, corresponding to the most extreme configurations whose shadow sizes are within the $2\sigma$-constraints of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). We use the ray-tracing software GYOTO to simulate the orbit of a spherically symmetric hot-spot emitting synchrotron radiation close to a central parametrized BH object, in a vertical magnetic field configuration, and we extract the corresponding astrometric and polarimetric observables for the Stokes parameters I, Q and U, namely the time integrated fluxes, temporal fluxes and magnitudes, temporal centroid, temporal QU-loops, and temporal Electric Field Position Angle (EVPA). Our results indicate that at low inclination the astrometric observables extracted from the parametrized BH spacetimes considered are qualitatively similar to those extracted from the Schwarzschild one, with minor quantitative deviations caused by differences in the size and position of the secondary images. On the other hand, the polarimetric observables at high inclination present qualitative differences, but these are only visible for a short portion of the whole hot-spot orbit. Furthermore, the observables extracted from the JP parametrized BH models deviate more prominently from those of the Schwarzschild model than the ones extracted from the KZ parametrized BH models, with the JP model with a positive free parameter deviating the most among all models tested. Given the strong similarity among the observables extracted from all models tested, we point out that more precise observations are needed to successfully impose constraints on parametrized BH models via this method.</description>

      <title>Effective resistivity in relativistic collisionless plasmoid-mediated reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection can power spectacular high-energy astrophysical phenomena by producing non-thermal energy distributions in highly magnetized regions around compact objects. By means of two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations we investigate relativistic collisionless plasmoid-mediated reconnection in magnetically dominated pair plasmas with and without guide field. In X-points, where diverging flows result in a non-diagonal thermal pressure tensor, a finite residence time for particles gives rise to a localized collisionless effective resistivity. Here, for the first time for relativistic reconnection in a fully developed plasmoid chain we identify the mechanisms driving the non-ideal electric field using a full Ohm's law by means of a statistical analysis based on our PIC simulations. We show that the non-ideal electric field is predominantly driven by gradients of nongyrotropic thermal pressures. We propose a kinetic physics motivated non-uniform effective resistivity model, which is negligible on global scales and becomes significant only locally in X-points, that captures the properties of collisionless reconnection with the aim of mimicking its essentials in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic descriptions. This effective resistivity model provides a viable opportunity to design physically grounded global models for reconnection-powered high-energy emission.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal analysis of ultra-fast radio bursts using per-channel arrival times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs), especially those from repeating sources, exhibit a rich variety of morphologies in their dynamic spectra (or waterfalls). Characterizing these morphologies and spectro-temporal properties is a key strategy in investigating the underlying unknown emission mechanism of FRBs. This type of analysis has been typically accomplished using two-dimensional Gaussian techniques and the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the waterfall. These techniques are effective and precise at all duration scales, but can be limited in the presence of scattered tails, complex morphologies, or recently observed microshot forests. Here, we present a technique that involves the tagging of per-channel arrival times of an FRB to perform spectro-temporal measurements using a Gaussian profile model for each channel. While scattering and dispersion remain important and often dominating sources of uncertainty in measurements, this technique provides an adaptable and firm foundation for obtaining spectro-temporal properties from all types of FRB morphologies. We present measurements using this technique of several hundred bursts across 12 repeating sources, including over 400 bursts from the repeating sources FRB 20121102A, FRB 20220912A, and FRB 20200120E, all of which exhibit recently observed microsecond-long ultra-FRBs, as well as 143 drift rates. In addition to retrieving the known relationship between sub-burst slope and duration, we explore other correlations between burst properties. We find that the sub-burst slope law extends smoothly to ultra-FRBs, and that ultra-FRBs appear to form a distinct population in the duration-frequency relation.</description>

      <title>Early and Extensive Ultraviolet Through Near Infrared Observations of the Intermediate-Luminosity Type Iax Supernovae 2024pxl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.</description>

      <title>XRISM Reveals Complex Multi-Temperature Structures in the Abell 2029 Galaxy Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $\sim$500 ks XRISM observations covering the central and two northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron (Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029 using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61 keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions, respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions. Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4 keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However, Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a 2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower temperatures and form stars.</description>

Abstract: Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$) compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1 source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the eRASS1 footprint.</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Ionization of Kilonova Ejecta: Observable Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characteristic rapid rise and decline at optical wavelengths of a kilonova is the product of the low ejecta mass ($\lesssim 0.05 M_\odot$) and high ejecta velocity ($\gtrsim 0.1$c). We show that, even at very early times ($\lesssim 2$ days), regions of ejecta fall below critical density and temperature thresholds at which non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects become important. Here, we present an approximate method for calculating the ionization state of the ejecta that accounts for the NLTE impact of high-energy electrons produced in the beta decay of freshly synthesized $r$-process elements. We find that incorporating ionization from high-energy electrons produces an ``inverted" and ``blended" ionization structure, where the most highly ionized species are located in the fastest moving homologous ejecta and multiple ionization states coexist. In radiation transport calculations, the higher degree of ionization reduces line blanketing in optical bands, leading to improved agreement with the light curve properties of AT\,2017gfo such as the duration, decay rates, brightness, and colors. Our quasi-NLTE implementation helps to alleviate tensions in kilonova modeling: for high-velocity ($\sim 0.3c$) ejecta components our models require less mass for a given peak brightness in optical bands, by as much as a factor of 3; our models can explain the presence of observed features associated to Sr II, W III, Se III, and Te III under conditions where LTE models would predict only neutral species; and we naturally predict the coexistence of species like Sr II and Ce III without the need for fine-tuning of the ejecta properties.</description>

      <title>Return of the Clocked Burster: Exceptionally Short Recurrence Time in GS 1826-238</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an exceptionally short burst recurrence time in the well-known clocked burster GS 1826$-$238, observed with the CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat. The source had remained in a persistent soft spectral state since its hard-to-soft transition in 2015 July until a soft-to-hard transition occurred in 2025 May. On 2025 June 23, NinjaSat began monitoring GS 1826$-$238 in the hard state and continued until the source returned to a steady soft state. During this period, we detected 19 X-ray bursts: 14 during the hard state, 4 in the transitional state, and 1 in the soft state. In the hard state, we identified a new clocked bursting epoch, during which the burst recurrence time remained highly stable and unprecedentedly short among the clocked bursting phases of GS 1826$-$238, with $t_{\rm rec} = 1.603 \pm 0.040$ hr ($1\sigma$ error). Furthermore, this recurrence time deviates significantly by approximately 37% from the previously established empirical relation $t_{\rm rec} \propto F_{\rm bol}^{-1.05}$, where $F_{\rm bol}$ is the bolometric persistent flux. These results suggest that the ignition conditions for X-ray bursts differed from those in earlier epochs. We explore possible explanations for this discrepancy and propose a scenario in which a smaller fraction of the neutron star surface was involved in fuel accumulation and nuclear burning. This situation leads to a high local accretion rate compared to earlier epochs, which naturally results in the exceptionally short recurrence time, as well as the observed reductions of approximately 38% in blackbody normalization (proportional to the emitting area) and 29% in burst fluence.</description>

      <title>Effect of generic dark matter halo on transonic accretion onto galactic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The environment surrounding a black hole or black hole binaries is generally expected to play an important role in understanding various astrophysical phenomena around them. In this paper, we study relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic supermassive black hole dressed with a cold dark matter halo. Focusing on different relativistic dark matter distributions with an inner density spike, we analyze the effect of the dark matter halo on the topology and properties of the accretion flow. Our results show enhancement of disk luminosity in the presence of dark matter, which depends on the nature and properties (halo mass and compactness) of the dark matter distribution. Under the assumptions of our accretion model, the dominant contribution to the disk luminosity for compact and massive halos arises from the inner regions of the accretion flow. Consequently, our analysis indicates that luminosity measurements can serve as an effective probe of the underlying dark matter density spike.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of nonlocal gravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the quasinormal modes of a new class of nonlocal static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard theory of gravity. These solutions are constructed as linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime and are characterized by an inverse power-law behavior of the lapse metric function. We derive the radial profiles of the effective potentials corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic and axial gravitational fluctuations on the BH background. Using the WKB method, complemented by Pad\'e approximants to regularize the trend of the effective potential near its peak, we compute the complex quasinormal mode frequencies associated with each type of perturbation. Our results are examined from both mathematical and physical perspectives, and are substantiated with references to existing literature. In particular, we compare the numerical outcomes with the predictions of the Schwarzschild metric to quantify deviations from the framework of general relativity. When all types of perturbations are combined, the relative deviations of the fundamental modes can reach up to $\sim 12\%$. Finally, we discuss the possibility to place observational bounds in the BH parameter space, based on the predicted sensitivities of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>
