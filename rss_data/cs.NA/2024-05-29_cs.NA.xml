      <title>Unisolvence of unsymmetric random Kansa collocation by Gaussians and other analytic RBF vanishing at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short proof of almost sure invertibility of unsymmetric random Kansa collocation matrices by a class of analytic RBF vanishing at infinity, for the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Such a class includes popular Positive Definite instances such as Gaussians, Generalized Inverse MultiQuadrics and Matern RBF. The proof works on general domains in any dimension, with any distribution of boundary collocation points and any continuous random distribution of internal collocation points.</description>

      <title>Locally different models in a checkerboard pattern with mesh adaptation and error control for multiple quantities of interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply multi-goal oriented error estimation to the finite element method. In particular, we use the dual weighted residual method and apply it to a model problem. This model problem consist of locally different coercive partial differential equations in a checkerboard pattern, where the solution is continuous across the interface. In addition to the error estimation, the error can be localized using a partition of unity technique. The resulting adaptive algorithm is substantiated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Rao-Nakra sandwich beam with a dissipation of fractional derivative type: theoretical and numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the solution and stability of a one-dimensional model depicting Rao--Nakra sandwich beams, incorporating damping terms characterized by fractional derivative types within the domain, specifically a generalized Caputo derivative with exponential weight. To address existence, uniqueness, stability, and numerical results, fractional derivatives are substituted by diffusion equations relative to a new independent variable, $\xi$, resulting in an augmented model with a dissipative semigroup operator. Polynomial decay of energy is achieved, with a decay rate depending on the fractional derivative parameters. Both the polynomial decay and its dependency on the parameters of the generalized Caputo derivative are numerically validated. To this end, an energy-conserving finite difference numerical scheme is employed.</description>

      <title>Diagonalization-Based Parallel-in-Time Preconditioners for Instationary Fluid Flow Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a new parallel-in-time approach for solving large-scale optimization problems constrained by time-dependent partial differential equations arising from fluid dynamics. The solver involves the use of a block circulant approximation of the original matrices, enabling parallelization-in-time via the use of fast Fourier transforms, and we devise bespoke matrix approximations which may be applied within this framework. These make use of permutations, saddle-point approximations, commutator arguments, as well as inner solvers such as the Uzawa method, Chebyshev semi-iteration, and multigrid. Theoretical results underpin our strategy of applying a block circulant strategy, and numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach on Stokes and Oseen problems. Noteably, satisfying results for the strong and weak scaling of our methods are provided within a fully parallel architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a matrix-free multigrid method for high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods with GPU acceleration. A performance analysis is conducted, comparing various data and compute layouts. Smoother implementations are optimized through localization and fast diagonalization techniques. Leveraging conflict-free access patterns in shared memory, arithmetic throughput of up to 39% of the peak performance on Nvidia A100 GPUs are achieved. Experimental results affirm the effectiveness of mixed-precision approaches and MPI parallelization in accelerating algorithms. Furthermore, an assessment of solver efficiency and robustness is provided across both two and three dimensions, with applications to Poisson problems.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving scheme for computing effective diffusivity and anomalous diffusion phenomena of random flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the diffusion behavior of particles moving in stochastic flows under a structure-preserving scheme. We compute the effective diffusivity for normal diffusive random flows and establish the power law between spatial and temporal variables for cases with anomalous diffusion phenomena. From a Lagrangian approach, we separate the corresponding stochastic differential equations (SDEs) into sub-problems and construct a one-step structure-preserving method to solve them. Then by modified equation systems, the convergence analysis in calculating the effective diffusivity is provided and compared between the structure-preserving scheme and the Euler-Maruyama scheme. Also, we provide the error estimate for the structure-preserving scheme in calculating the power law for a series of super-diffusive random flows. Finally, we calculate the effective diffusivity and anomalous diffusion phenomena for a series of 2D and 3D random fields.</description>

      <title>An implementation of tensor product patch smoothers on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a GPU implementation of vertex-patch smoothers for higher order finite element methods in two and three dimensions. Analysis shows that they are not memory bound with respect to GPU DRAM, but with respect to on-chip scratchpad memory. Multigrid operations are optimized through localization and reorganized local operations in on-chip memory, achieving minimal global data transfer and a conflict free memory access pattern. Performance tests demonstrate that the optimized kernel is at least 2 times faster than the straightforward implementation for the Poisson problem, across various polynomial degrees in 2D and 3D, achieving up to 36% of the peak performance in both single and double precision on Nvidia A100 GPU.</description>

      <title>On adaptive stochastic extended iterative methods for solving least squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive stochastic extended iterative method, which can be viewed as an improved extension of the randomized extended Kaczmarz (REK) method, for finding the unique minimum Euclidean norm least-squares solution of a given linear system. In particular, we introduce three equivalent stochastic reformulations of the linear least-squares problem: stochastic unconstrained and constrained optimization problems, and the stochastic multiobjective optimization problem. We then alternately employ the adaptive variants of the stochastic heavy ball momentum (SHBM) method, which utilize iterative information to update the parameters, to solve the stochastic reformulations. We prove that our method converges linearly in expectation, addressing an open problem in the literature related to designing theoretically supported adaptive SHBM methods. Numerical experiments show that our adaptive stochastic extended iterative method has strong advantages over the non-adaptive one.</description>

      <title>Greedy Kernel Methods for Approximating Breakthrough Curves for Reactive Flow from 3D Porous Geometry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenging application of 3D pore scale reactive flow under varying geometry parameters. The task is to predict time-dependent integral quantities, i.e., breakthrough curves, from the given geometries. As the 3D reactive flow simulation is highly complex and computationally expensive, we are interested in data-based surrogates that can give a rapid prediction of the target quantities of interest. This setting is an example of an application with scarce data, i.e., only having available few data samples, while the input and output dimensions are high. In this scarce data setting, standard machine learning methods are likely to ail. Therefore, we resort to greedy kernel approximation schemes that have shown to be efficient meshless approximation techniques for multivariate functions. We demonstrate that such methods can efficiently be used in the high-dimensional input/output case under scarce data. Especially, we show that the vectorial kernel orthogonal greedy approximation (VKOGA) procedure with a data-adapted two-layer kernel yields excellent predictors for learning from 3D geometry voxel data via both morphological descriptors or principal component analysis.</description>

      <title>A numerical algorithm with linear complexity for Multi-marginal Optimal Transport with $L^1$ Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerically solving multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) problems is computationally prohibitive, even for moderate-scale instances involving $l\ge4$ marginals with support sizes of $N\ge1000$. The cost in MMOT is represented as a tensor with $N^l$ elements. Even accessing each element once incurs a significant computational burden. In fact, many algorithms require direct computation of tensor-vector products, leading to a computational complexity of $O(N^l)$ or beyond. In this paper, inspired by our previous work [$Comm. \ Math. \ Sci.$, 20 (2022), pp. 2053 - 2057], we observe that the costly tensor-vector products in the Sinkhorn Algorithm can be computed with a recursive process by separating summations and dynamic programming. Based on this idea, we propose a fast tensor-vector product algorithm to solve the MMOT problem with $L^1$ cost, achieving a miraculous reduction in the computational cost of the entropy regularized solution to $O(N)$. Numerical experiment results confirm such high performance of this novel method which can be several orders of magnitude faster than the original Sinkhorn algorithm.</description>

      <title>A simple inverse power method for balanced graph cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existing inverse power ($\mathbf{IP}$) method for solving the balanced graph cut lacks local convergence and its inner subproblem requires a nonsmooth convex solver. To address these issues, we develop a simple inverse power ($\mathbf{SIP}$) method using a novel equivalent continuous formulation of the balanced graph cut, and its inner subproblem allows an explicit analytic solution, which is the biggest advantage over $\mathbf{IP}$ and constitutes the main reason why we call it $\mathit{simple}$. By fully exploiting the closed-form of the inner subproblem solution, we design a boundary-detected subgradient selection with which $\mathbf{SIP}$ is proved to be locally converged. We show that $\mathbf{SIP}$ is also applicable to a new ternary valued $\theta$-balanced cut which reduces to the balanced cut when $\theta=1$. When $\mathbf{SIP}$ reaches its local optimum, we seamlessly transfer to solve the $\theta$-balanced cut within exactly the same iteration algorithm framework and thus obtain $\mathbf{SIP}$-$\mathbf{perturb}$ -- an efficient local breakout improvement of $\mathbf{SIP}$, which transforms some ``partitioned" vertices back to the ``un-partitioned" ones through the adjustable $\theta$. Numerical experiments on G-set for Cheeger cut and Sparsest cut demonstrate that $\mathbf{SIP}$ is significantly faster than $\mathbf{IP}$ while maintaining approximate solutions of comparable quality, and $\mathbf{SIP}$-$\mathbf{perturb}$ outperforms $\mathtt{Gurobi}$ in terms of both computational cost and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Weak Generative Sampler to Efficiently Sample Invariant Distribution of Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples. Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>Entropy-stable positivity-preserving DG schemes for Boltzmann-Poisson models of collisional electronic transport along energy bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.00593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is related to developing entropy-stable positivity-preserving Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods as a computational scheme for Boltzmann-Poisson systems modeling the probability density of collisional electronic transport along semiconductor energy bands. In momentum coordinates representing spherical / energy-angular variables, we pose the respective Vlasov-Boltzmann equation with a linear collision operator and a singular measure, modeling scatterings as functions of the band structure appropriately for hot electron nanoscale transport.
  We show stability results of semi-discrete DG schemes under an entropy norm for 1D-position (2D-momentum) and 2D-position (3D-momentum), using dissipative properties of the collisional operator given its entropy inequality. The latter depends on an exponential of the Hamiltonian rather than the Maxwellian associated with only kinetic energy. For the 1D problem, knowing the analytic solution to the Poisson equation and convergence to a constant current is crucial to obtaining full stability (weighted entropy norm decreasing over time). For the 2D problem, specular reflection boundary conditions and periodicity are considered in estimating stability under an entropy norm. Regarding the positivity-preservation proofs in the DG scheme for the 1D problem, inspired by \cite{ZhangShu1}, \cite{ZhangShu2}, and \cite{CGP}, \cite{EECHXM-JCP}, we treat collisions as a source and find convex combinations of the transport and collision terms which guarantee positivity of the cell average of our numerical probability density at the next time. The positivity of the numerical solution to the probability density in the domain is guaranteed by applying the limiters in \cite{ZhangShu1} and \cite{ZhangShu2} that preserve the cell average modifying the slope of the piecewise linear solutions to make the function non-negative.</description>

      <title>Variable Transformations in combination with Wavelets and ANOVA for high-dimensional approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use hyperbolic wavelet regression for the fast reconstruction of high-dimensional functions having only low dimensional variable interactions. Compactly supported periodic Chui-Wang wavelets are used for the tensorized hyperbolic wavelet basis on the torus. With a variable transformation we are able to transform the approximation rates and fast algorithms from the torus to other domains. We perform and analyze scattered-data approximation for smooth but arbitrary density functions by using a least squares method. The corresponding system matrix is sparse due to the compact support of the wavelets, which leads to a significant acceleration of the matrix vector multiplication. For non-periodic functions we propose a new extension method. A proper choice of the extension parameter together with the piece-wise polynomial Chui-Wang wavelets extends the functions appropriately. In every case we are able to bound the approximation error with high probability. Additionally, if the function has low effective dimension (i.e. only interactions of few variables), we qualitatively determine the variable interactions and omit ANOVA terms with low variance in a second step in order to decrease the approximation error. This allows us to suggest an adapted model for the approximation. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Algorithmically Designed Artificial Neural Networks (ADANNs): Higher order deep operator learning for parametric partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we propose a new deep learning approach to approximate operators related to parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we introduce a new strategy to design specific artificial neural network (ANN) architectures in conjunction with specific ANN initialization schemes which are tailor-made for the particular approximation problem under consideration. In the proposed approach we combine efficient classical numerical approximation techniques with deep operator learning methodologies. Specifically, we introduce customized adaptions of existing ANN architectures together with specialized initializations for these ANN architectures so that at initialization we have that the ANNs closely mimic a chosen efficient classical numerical algorithm for the considered approximation problem. The obtained ANN architectures and their initialization schemes are thus strongly inspired by numerical algorithms as well as by popular deep learning methodologies from the literature and in that sense we refer to the introduced ANNs in conjunction with their tailor-made initialization schemes as Algorithmically Designed Artificial Neural Networks (ADANNs). We numerically test the proposed ADANN methodology in the case of several parametric PDEs. In the tested numerical examples the ADANN methodology significantly outperforms existing traditional approximation algorithms as well as existing deep operator learning methodologies from the literature.</description>

      <title>Double-loop randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator for nested integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterized by an outer integral connected to an inner integral through a nonlinear function, nested integration is a challenging problem in various fields, such as engineering and mathematical finance. The available numerical methods for nested integration based on Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be prohibitively expensive owing to the error propagating from the inner to the outer integral. Attempts to enhance the efficiency of these approximations using the quasi-MC (QMC) or randomized QMC (rQMC) method have focused on either the inner or outer integral approximation. This work introduces a novel nested rQMC method that simultaneously addresses the approximation of the inner and outer integrals. This method leverages the unique nested integral structure to offer a more efficient approximation mechanism. By incorporating Owen's scrambling techniques, we address integrands exhibiting infinite variation in the Hardy--Krause sense, enabling theoretically sound error estimates. As the primary contribution, we derive asymptotic error bounds for the bias and variance of our estimator, along with the regularity conditions under which these bounds can be attained. In addition, we provide nearly optimal sample sizes for the rQMC approximations underlying the numerical implementation of the proposed method. Moreover, we derive a truncation scheme to make our estimator applicable in the context of expected information gain estimation and indicate how to use importance sampling to remedy the measure concentration arising in the inner integral. We verify the estimator quality through numerical experiments by comparing the computational efficiency of the nested rQMC method against standard nested MC integration for two case studies: one in thermomechanics and the other in pharmacokinetics. These examples highlight the computational savings and enhanced applicability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Mixed finite elements for Kirchhoff-Love plate bending</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mixed finite element method with triangular and parallelogram meshes for the Kirchhoff-Love plate bending model. Critical ingredient is the construction of low-dimensional local spaces and appropriate degrees of freedom that provide conformity in terms of a sufficiently large tensor space and that allow for any kind of physically relevant Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For Dirichlet boundary conditions and polygonal plates, we prove quasi-optimal convergence of the mixed scheme. An a posteriori error estimator is derived for the special case of the biharmonic problem. Numerical results for regular and singular examples illustrate our findings. They confirm expected convergence rates and exemplify the performance of an adaptive algorithm steered by our error estimator.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares Neural Network (LSNN) Method For Linear Advection-Reaction Equation: Non-constant Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The least-squares ReLU neural network (LSNN) method was introduced and studied for solving linear advection-reaction equation with discontinuous solution in \cite{Cai2021linear,cai2023least}. The method is based on an equivalent least-squares formulation and \cite{cai2023least} employs ReLU neural network (NN) functions with $\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil+1$-layer representations for approximating solutions. In this paper, we show theoretically that the method is also capable of accurately approximating non-constant jumps along discontinuous interfaces that are not necessarily straight lines. Theoretical results are confirmed through multiple numerical examples with $d=2,3$ and various non-constant jumps and interface shapes, showing that the LSNN method with $\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil+1$ layers approximates solutions accurately with degrees of freedom less than that of mesh-based methods and without the common Gibbs phenomena along discontinuous interfaces having non-constant jumps.</description>

      <title>Reflectionless discrete perfectly matched layers for higher-order finite difference schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces discrete-holomorphic Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) specifically designed for high-order finite difference (FD) discretizations of the scalar wave equation. In contrast to standard PDE-based PMLs, the proposed method achieves the remarkable outcome of completely eliminating numerical reflections at the PML interface, in practice achieving errors at the level of machine precision. Our approach builds upon the ideas put forth in a recent publication [Journal of Computational Physics 381 (2019): 91-109] expanding the scope from the standard second-order FD method to arbitrary high-order schemes. This generalization uses additional localized PML variables to accommodate the larger stencils employed. We establish that the numerical solutions generated by our proposed schemes exhibit an exponential decay rate as they propagate within the PML domain. To showcase the effectiveness of our method, we present a variety of numerical examples, including waveguide problems. These examples highlight the importance of employing high-order schemes to effectively address and minimize undesired numerical dispersion errors, emphasizing the practical advantages and applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient solution of sequences of parametrized Lyapunov equations with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequences of parametrized Lyapunov equations can be encountered in many application settings. Moreover, solutions of such equations are often intermediate steps of an overall procedure whose main goal is the computation of $\text{trace}(EX)$ where $X$ denotes the solution of a Lyapunov equation and $E$ is a given matrix. We are interested in addressing problems where the parameter dependency of the coefficient matrix is encoded as a low-rank modification to a \emph{seed}, fixed matrix. We propose two novel numerical procedures that fully exploit such a common structure. The first one builds upon the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) formula and recycling Krylov techniques, and it is well-suited for small dimensional problems as it makes use of dense numerical linear algebra tools. The second algorithm can instead address large-scale problems by relying on state-of-the-art projection techniques based on the extended Krylov subspace. We test the new algorithms on several problems arising in the study of damped vibrational systems and the analyses of output synchronization problems for multi-agent systems. Our results show that the algorithms we propose are superior to state-of-the-art techniques as they are able to remarkably speed up the computation of accurate solutions.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation via vortex tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation, for which a well-known feature is the appearance of quantized vortices with core size of the order of a small parameter $\varepsilon$. Without a magnetic field and with suitable initial conditions, these vortices interact, in the singular limit $\varepsilon\to0$, through an explicit Hamiltonian dynamics. Using this analytical framework, we develop and analyze a numerical strategy based on the reduced-order Hamiltonian system to efficiently simulate the infinite-dimensional GP equation for small, but finite, $\varepsilon$. This method allows us to avoid numerical stability issues in solving the GP equation, where small values of $\varepsilon$ typically require very fine meshes and time steps. We also provide a mathematical justification of our method in terms of rigorous error estimates of the error in the supercurrent, together with numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Low-SWaP 1024-beam Digital Array: A 32-beam Sub-system at 5.8 GHz</title>

Abstract: Millimeter wave communications require multibeam beamforming in order to utilize wireless channels that suffer from obstructions, path loss, and multi-path effects. Digital multibeam beamforming has maximum degrees of freedom compared to analog phased arrays. However, circuit complexity and power consumption are important constraints for digital multibeam systems. A low-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a multiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple simultaneous RF beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic complexity due to multiplication is reduced from the FFT complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\: \log N)$ for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a 46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively, for the $N=32$ case considered. The paper describes the proposed 32-point DFT approximation targeting a 1024-beams using a 2D array, and shows the multiplierless approximation and its mapping to a 32-beam sub-system consisting of 5.8 GHz antennas that can be used for generating 1024 digital beams without multiplications. Real-time beam computation is achieved using a Xilinx FPGA at 120 MHz bandwidth per beam. Theoretical beam performance is compared with measured RF patterns from both a fixed-point FFT as well as the proposed multiplier-free algorithm and are in good agreement.</description>

      <title>GPLaSDI: Gaussian Process-based Interpretable Latent Space Dynamics Identification through Deep Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be challenging and computationally expensive. This has led to the development of reduced-order models (ROMs) that are accurate but faster than full order models (FOMs). Recently, machine learning advances have enabled the creation of non-linear projection methods, such as Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI). LaSDI maps full-order PDE solutions to a latent space using autoencoders and learns the system of ODEs governing the latent space dynamics. By interpolating and solving the ODE system in the reduced latent space, fast and accurate ROM predictions can be made by feeding the predicted latent space dynamics into the decoder. In this paper, we introduce GPLaSDI, a novel LaSDI-based framework that relies on Gaussian process (GP) for latent space ODE interpolations. Using GPs offers two significant advantages. First, it enables the quantification of uncertainty over the ROM predictions. Second, leveraging this prediction uncertainty allows for efficient adaptive training through a greedy selection of additional training data points. This approach does not require prior knowledge of the underlying PDEs. Consequently, GPLaSDI is inherently non-intrusive and can be applied to problems without a known PDE or its residual. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Burgers equation, Vlasov equation for plasma physics, and a rising thermal bubble problem. Our proposed method achieves between 200 and 100,000 times speed-up, with up to 7% relative error.</description>

      <title>PT-symmetry enabled stable modes in multi-core fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open systems with balanced gain and loss, described by parity-time PT-symmetric Hamiltonians have been deeply explored over the past decade. Most explorations are limited to finite discrete models (in real or reciprocal spaces) or continuum problems in one dimension. As a result, these models do not leverage the complexity and variability of two-dimensional continuum problems on a compact support. Here, we investigate eigenvalues of the Schrodinger equation on a disk with zero boundary condition, in the presence of constant, PT-symmetric, gain-loss potential that is confined to two mirror-symmetric disks. We find a rich variety of exceptional points, re-entrant PT-symmetric phases, and a non-monotonic dependence of the PT-symmetry breaking threshold on the system parameters. By comparing results of two model variations, we show that this simple model of a multi-core fiber supports propagating modes in the presence of gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Regularized Nonnegative Scale-invariant Low-rank Approximation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations such as sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization or sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition are an important branch of dimensionality reduction models with enhanced interpretability. However, from a practical perspective, the choice of regularizers and regularization coefficients, as well as the design of efficient algorithms, is challenging because of the multifactor nature of these models and the lack of theory to back these choices. This paper aims at improving upon these issues. By studying a more general model called the Homogeneous Regularized Scale-Invariant, we prove that the scale-invariance inherent to low-rank approximation models causes an implicit regularization with both unexpected beneficial and detrimental effects. This observation allows to better understand the effect of regularization functions in low-rank approximation models, to guide the choice of the regularization hyperparameters, and to design balancing strategies to enhance the convergence speed of dedicated optimization algorithms. Some of these results were already known but restricted to specific instances of regularized low-rank approximations. We also derive a generic Majorization Minimization algorithm that handles many regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations, with convergence guarantees. We showcase our contributions on sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, ridge-regularized Canonical Polyadic decomposition and sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>
