      <title>Dynamic topological exciton-polaritons enabling ultrafast logic operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological active materials have emerged as powerful paradigm bridging the discovery of exotic topological phases of matter with the development of functional topological devices. The recent extension of these material systems into dynamic regime, where topological properties can be actively manipulated at ultrafast timescales, promises unprecedented control over topological states and their functionalities. However, translating the static topological lasing signals into high-performance logic functions remain highly challenging, which imposes a far more stringent set of materials attributes. Here, leveraging the strong nonlinearity and pronounced spectral isolation of perovskite exciton-polaritons embedded in a Dirac vortex microcavity, we experimentally demonstrate the dynamic topological Majorana-like state polariton condensation with its ultrafast logic operations at room temperature. By actively coordinating pump and control beams in both spectral and temporal domain, we dynamically steer the topological polariton condensation process and demonstrate AND and NOT logic operations, achieving record extinction ratio (~20 dB), extremely low control fluence (~0.2 nJ/cm2) and sub-picosecond response time (~500 fs). Our results expand the frontier of dynamic topology and establish a novel pathway towards robust, ultrafast, and reconfigurable on-chip polaritonic logic circuits.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Optical Encoders for Generalizable Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the utility of meta-optical encoders for generalizable image compression by leveraging their intrinsic shift-invariant point spread functions (PSFs). Compared with purely digital approaches, such optical encoders offer parallel and energy-efficient compression, enabling early data reduction prior to electronic processing and transmission, which is particularly attractive for resource-constrained and compact imaging systems. Although the operations realizable by a single passive optical layer remain fundamentally constrained, we systematically study several PSF encoding strategies combined with a total-variation (TV) digital reconstruction backend. Specifically, under identical compression ratios, we compare spatial binning, multi-channel random, and multi-channel orthogonal PSF based designs. Our results show that, at the same compression ratios, spatial binning achieves the highest reconstruction quality among all encoding strategies; however, it exhibits limited robustness to noise compared with multi-channel methods.</description>

      <title>Rigorous electromagnetic quasinormal-mode method made easy for users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-wave numerical methods based on quasinormal modes (QNMs) offer valuable physical insights and computational efficiency for analyzing electromagnetic resonators. However, despite their advantages, many researchers in electromagnetism continue to favor real-frequency domain or time-domain approaches, often using finite element or finite-difference time-domain methods. This preference stems from various factors, including the perception that QNM theory is still developing or requires advanced mathematical tools from complex analysis. In this work, we combine numerical techniques with accurate ap-proximations to simplify the computation of QNMs and enable ultrafast reconstructions us-ing QNM expansions. The result is a new approach that is straightforwardly accessible to users familiar with real-frequency methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our ap-proach through an open-source package [Doi: 10.5281/zenodo.18708748] implemented within a widely-used commercial photonics software.</description>

      <title>Cavity Solitons as a Nonlinear Substrate for Photonic Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing leverages nonlinear dynamics of physical systems to process temporal information with minimal training cost. Here, we demonstrate that cavity solitons sustained in a fiber optical cavity provide an optical platform for photonic reservoir computing. Our methodology exploits the use of a phase-modulated drive laser to encode the input, while the reservoir states are accessed through frequency-resolved readout. Numerical simulations indicate that the emission of Kelly waves enriches the dynamics and enhances performance for machine learning tasks. We evaluate the performance of the cavity-soliton reservoir computer on several standard benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>BONNI: Gradient-Informed Bayesian and Interior Point Optimization for Efficient Inverse Design in Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design, particularly geometric shape optimization, provides a systematic approach for developing high-performance nanophotonic devices. While numerous optimization algorithms exist, previous global approaches exhibit slow convergence and conversely local search strategies frequently become trapped in local optima. To address the limitations inherent to both local and global approaches, we introduce BONNI: Bayesian optimization through neural network ensemble surrogates with interior point optimization. It augments global optimization with an efficient incorporation of gradient information to determine optimal sampling points. This capability allows BONNI to circumvent the local optima found in many nanophotonic applications, while capitalizing on the efficiency of gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate BONNI's capabilities in the design of a distributed Bragg reflector as well as a dual-layer grating coupler through an exhaustive comparison against other optimization algorithms commonly used in literature. Using BONNI, we were able to design a 10-layer distributed Bragg reflector with only 4.5% mean spectral error, compared to the previously reported results of 7.8% error with 16 layers. Further designs of a broadband waveguide taper and photonic crystal waveguide transition validate the capabilities of BONNI.</description>

      <title>Nanoscopy of surface polarization with oblique dipole orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general electromagnetic description for dipoles confined to surfaces with oblique dipole moment orientations, extending the conventional in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) treatments. This description is useful for describing localized polarization in, \textit{e.g.}, van der Waals heterostructures, thin films of molecular aggregates, and metal-dielectric interfaces. The theory is suitable for any material with vanishingly thin thickness relative to the light wavelength, independent of the geometry of the material and the media interfacing it. We apply the formalism to a uniaxial excitonic sheet, covering a large number of two-dimensional (2D) materials and organic thin films. Our theory reveals pairs of polaritonic resonances originating from the IP and OOP components of the excitonic dipole moment. The formalism suggests experimentally accessible signatures of dipole moment orientation, enhanced by near-field probes. This work proposes a unified language for the description of 2D materials, thin films and interfaces with anisotropic dipolar responses.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Raman scattering in SDM fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) is a weak non-linear effect, particularly relevant to classical-quantum coexistence transmission and sensing applications. In classical transmission, the relevant Raman effect is stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and recent studies have examined it in space-division multiplexing (SDM) fibers. An intrinsic relation between SpRS and SRS allows previous SRS results to inform SpRS models. In this work, we extend SpRS models derived for single-mode fibers (SMFs) to SDM fibers with multiple mode groups of degenerate modes, covering both Stokes and anti-Stokes bands. The proposed model is a useful, fiber-design-independent tool for evaluating scattered noise in optical links, and it is validated through experimental measurements in field-deployed multi-core fibers (MCFs) and multi-mode fiber (MMF), showing good agreement.</description>

      <title>Photonic-computing error correction through optical en-/decoder calibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic processors have emerged as an attractive platform for fast and energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplication. However, they are susceptible to error due to their analog nature. Here, we present an error-correction technique that implements a correction offset to the optical en-/decoders of photonic processors. Our proposed method is general-purpose, does not require introducing any additional components to the photonic network, and can address errors stemming from unbalanced losses, 50/50 beamsplitter deviations, digital-to-analog conversion inaccuracies, and any unknown sources. In particular, we show that our method is highly effective in mitigating unbalanced-loss errors, a problem that has not previously been addressed by any error-correction technique. Using this approach, we achieve over 90% error reduction in large triangular meshes, overcoming a key obstacle to highly accurate photonic processors for information processing.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Structured-Illumination X-Ray Microscopy based on Fourier Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structured-illumination technique for full-field super-resolution transmission X-ray microscopy, which employs Fourier spectral decomposition inspired by established methods in visible-light microscopy. A 2D grating creating this illumination is stepped across one period to acquire a set of images at unique illumination positions. The Fourier domain of each image is described as a linear combination of replicated sample information at each frequency harmonic. As this superposition is created independently of detection, it contains spatial information exceeding native detector resolution. Recovering the encoded high-frequency components enables the population of an expanded frequency space. We demonstrate the presence of additional sample information in the Fourier spectrum and introduce a method to recover it. We achieve a resolution improvement by a factor of 2.1 for the projection image of a resolution test pattern. We further demonstrate seamless integration into standard X-ray tomography acquisition schemes. The acquisition is inherently multimodal, as phase-contrast and dark-field images can be computed from the same data using methods such as unified modulated pattern analysis, while providing an additional super-resolved transmission channel. These results indicate broad potential for non-destructive testing and biomedical imaging, as they alleviate pixel-size limitations in photon-counting detectors and sample-size restrictions imposed by optical magnification.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Driven Ground-State Search in Coupled Laser Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimisation problems, which appear in numerous fields of science and industry, are challenging to solve even with modern supercomputers. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state searches of spin Hamiltonians, implemented on various physical platforms whose intrinsic dynamics are analogous to spin systems. However, the complex energy landscape of spin Hamiltonians often traps the system in local minima, preventing the system from reaching the ground-state (global minimum). We demonstrate an intrinsic feedback-driven annealing mechanism in class-B semiconductor laser arrays arising from the interplay of internal ($\alpha$) and external ($\eta$) coupling. The instantaneous phase configuration self-modulates amplitude fluctuations, which act as an effective temperature, dynamically reshaping the potential and enabling the system to escape from local minima. Using a one-dimensional ring laser array, we analyze defect formation in the $\alpha$-$\eta$ parameter space and identify an optimal regime achieving nearly 100% ground-state probability. Although both $\alpha$ and $\eta$ are essential for the feedback loop, defect suppression results from modifying two competing timescales: amplitude stabilization (t_amp) and phase locking (t_phase), analogous to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. These timescales can be tuned independently via $\alpha$ or $\eta$. Identical timescale ratios yield identical defect probabilities, confirming that relative timescales, not specific parameters, govern defect formation. Our findings establish internal feedback-driven annealing as a practical route to ground-state search in semiconductor laser arrays, providing a foundation for efficient and scalable laser-based spin simulators for tackling hard optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Pole-Expansion of the T-Matrix Based on a Matrix-Valued AAA-Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition matrix (T-matrix) is a complete description of an object's linear scattering response. As such, it has found wide adoption for the theoretical and computational description of multiple-scattering phenomena. In its original form, the T-matrix describes the interaction of a scatterer with a monochromatic source. In practice, however, information about the T-matrix is usually needed in an extended spectral domain. To access the frequency-dispersion, one might naively sample T-matrices over a finely resolved set of discrete frequencies and store one T-matrix per frequency. This approach has multiple drawbacks: it is computationally expensive, requires excessive memory, and it disregards the physical origin of the spectral features, weakening physical interpretability. To overcome these major limitations, we leverage a pole-expansion technique to represent the T-matrix with arbitrary frequency resolution within a selected frequency domain via a set of resonant contributions. A matrix-valued variant of the recently established adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational approximation enables us to compute the pole-expansion at minimal computational cost using only a small number of direct evaluations. We demonstrate the benefits of such a representation with examples ranging from semi-analytically accessible scatterers to quasi-dual bound states in the continuum. To allow the wider community to capitalize on these findings, we provide open-source tools to perform the presented pole-expansion of the T-matrix.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Geometric Phase Matching by Multilayered Nonlinear Thin-Film Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase matching is essential for efficient energy transfer in nonlinear wave-mixing processes. Traditional methods, such as birefringent and quasi-phase matching, have remained conceptually unchanged since their discovery over 60 years ago, each posing inherent constraints and limitations. Here, we demonstrate the concept of geometric phase matching as a new paradigm for tunable nonlinear wave mixing, based on a multilayered platform of nonlinear thin-film crystals. We leverage this concept to experimentally show reconfigurable and spin-controlled phase matching for second-harmonic generation (SHG), opening new avenues for real-time manipulation of nonlinear interactions in photonic devices. We specifically demonstrate full modulation of SHG from a bilayer structure, nearly perfect and tunable geometric phase matching from an eight-layer structure, and polarization tomography that reveals the evolution of the spin dependent interaction. This approach not only expands the design space for nonlinear optical processes but also paves the way for highly robust, tunable and efficient frequency conversion, for next-generation adaptive nonlinear photonic, quantum photonic and nonlinear optical metamaterial technologies based on thin-film crystals.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of a topological nematic phase in a spin-compensated magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density waves conventionally describe the periodic modulation of charge or spin, yet the spatial modulation of electronic topology has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a Berry-curvature density wave in the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3NiN with compensated spins. Using high-precision Sagnac Kerr microscopy, we directly image micrometer-scale modulations of the Berry curvature. These topological ripples exhibit orientations unpinned to the crystal lattice, forming a nematic phase that spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry. We attribute this instability to field-induced spatial variations of the spin texture driven by competing magnetic interactions. This discovery unveils a new class of collective order in spin-compensated magnets arising from the geometric phase of the wavefunction itself and offering a tunable degree of freedom for topological spintronics based on antiferromagnets and altermagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving near-unity fidelity in conventional continuous-variable quantum teleportation schemes based on two-mode squeezed vacuum states is fundamentally unattainable. To overcome this limitation, alternative approaches utilizing ensembles of two-dimensional entangled qubits have been proposed. In this work, we investigate continuous-variable quantum teleportation employing entangled qutrit resources under realistic noise effects. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well in both ideal and noisy conditions, enabling high-fidelity teleportation with a reasonable success probability.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of swift-electron momentum transfer to a large spherical nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swift electrons from highly focused beams produced in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes offer a powerful route for probing and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion. Our work establishes a robust reference framework for momentum transfer calculations and provides quantitative benchmarks relevant for electron-beam-based nanoscale manipulation.</description>

Abstract: C.V. Raman (1888-1970) was one of the pioneering scientists to have emerged from India during the colonial era. His scientific explorations were driven by his curiosity to understand wave phenomena. Naturally, optics and related physical effects were at the heart of such an exploration. Apart from his Nobel prize-winning discovery of the Raman effect, his research included topics such as oblique diffraction, light scattering from liquids and amorphous solids, classical and quantum nature of light, acousto-optics, haloes and coronae (speckles), crystal dynamics and soft modes, optics of minerals, floral colors, physiology of vision and many other aspects related to light in natural settings. In this article, I give a historical overview of some of the work by C.V. Raman and his group that had a direct connection to optics and optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Digital defocus aberration interference for automated optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automation in optical microscopy is critical for enabling high-throughput imaging across a wide range of biomedical applications. Among the essential components of automated systems, robust autofocusing plays a pivotal role in maintaining image quality for both single-plane and volumetric imaging. However, conventional autofocusing methods often struggle with implementation complexity, limited generalizability across sample types, incompatibility with thick specimens, and slow feedback. We observed that the digitally summed Fourier spectrum of two images acquired from two-angle illumination exhibits interference-like fringe modulation when the sample is defocused. These digital fringes correlate directly with defocus through a physics-based relation. Based on this principle, we developed an automatic, efficient, and generalizable defocus detection method termed digital defocus aberration interference (DAbI). Implemented with a simple two-LED setup, DAbI can quantify the defocus distance over a range of 443 times the depth-of-field (DoF) for thin samples and 296 times for thick specimens. It can additionally extend the natural DoF of the imaging system by 20 folds when integrated with complex-field imaging. We demonstrated the versatile applications of DAbI on brightfield, complex-field, refractive index, confocal, and widefield fluorescence imaging, establishing it as a promising solution for automated, high-throughput optical microscopy.</description>

      <title>Programmable Photonic Circuit for Optical Logic Operations and 2-Bit Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a programmable silicon photonic circuit composed of cascaded multiport directional couplers interleaved with thermo-optic phase shifters. The device forms a reconfigurable interferometric network capable of realizing arbitrary $N \times N$ unitary transformations. By tuning the phase shifters, the same circuit can be configured to perform both optical logic gates and 2-bit decoding functions. Optimal phase settings are determined through Bayesian optimization. The circuit maintains stable operation across multiple wavelengths with 50 GHz spacing, suggesting potential for wavelength-parallel optical processing. These results highlight a pathway toward programmable and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Galvanometer-scanning transient phase microscopy with balanced detection and arbitrary pump polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient absorption microscopy measures excited-state kinetics based on the imaginary part of the pump-induced perturbation to the complex refractive index, i.e. $\Im \{\Delta\mathcal N\}$, with applications in both materials and biomedical sciences. Its complement, transient phase microscopy, enabled by stable inline birefringent interferometry, measures the real part $\Re\{\Delta \mathcal N\}$. The ability to switch between absorption and phase measurements may yield a stronger signal, depending on the sample and probe wavelength. To date, however, transient phase has not been coupled with galvanometer scanners, thus limiting it to materials science applications and non-imaging spectroscopy. Here, we extend transient phase microscopy to operate in a galvanometer-scanning microscope with balanced detection, comparing amplitude and phase measurements in graphene (in which amplitude detection has the advantage), hemoglobin and red blood cells (in which phase detection has the advantage). We examine the impacts and limitations introduced by galvanometer scanning, in addition to relocation of the pump-probe combining dichroic to permit arbitrary polarization of the pump.</description>

      <title>A fast, large-scale optimal transport algorithm for holographic beam shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport methods have recently established state of the art accuracy and efficiency for holographic laser beam shaping. However, use of such methods is hindered by severe $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time requirements for large scale input or output images with $N$ total pixels. Here we leverage the dual formulation of the optimal transport problem and the separable structure of the cost to implement algorithms with greatly reduced $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ time complexity. These algorithms are parallelizable and can solve megapixel-scale beam shaping problems in tens of seconds on a CPU or seconds on a GPU.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Multijunction Solar Cells Toward the Multicolor Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors enable transfer-printed, lattice-mismatch-free stacking of many photovoltaic junctions, motivating a re-examination of multijunction detailed-balance limits under realistic material and optical constraints. Here, we develop a unified thermodynamic framework for a multijunction photovoltaic device, which can define a clear set of device-window constraints, optical boundary conditions, and luminescence/entropy penalties and therefore define how closely any realistic multijunction photovoltaic device can approach multicolor limit. By applying it to a conservative TMD bandgap window (1.0-2.1~eV), we show that the accessible bandgap window imposes a large-junction number (N) efficiency limit: under full concentration, unconstrained ladders approach 84.5% at N=50, whereas the TMD window plateaus near 63.4%. This efficiency plateau is set by photons outside the bandgaps, so radiative quality and optics dominate beyond N=5 junctions for realistic transfer-printed device stacks. We identify an experimentally achievable N=5 ladder Eg~(2.10,1.78,1.50,1.24, 1.00)eV and map each rung to candidate vdW/TMD absorbers. Using reciprocity and luminescence thermodynamics, we quantify penalties from finite external radiative efficiency, two-sided emission, and luminescent coupling, and introduce the upward-emitted luminescence power as an indicator of entropy-loss proxy. Incorporating excitonic absorptance and nanophotonic thickness bounds yields practical thickness and light-management targets for transfer-printed stacks. Finally, inserting an idealized nonreciprocal multijunction model into the reciprocity-optimized ladders provides conservative efficiency advantage estimates, which are consistent with negligible benefit for single junctions but measurable efficiency gains for multijunction TMD devices.</description>

      <title>Global Self-Attention with Exact Fourier Propagation for Phase-Only Far-Field Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-only computer-generated holography (CGH) seeks a phase pattern for a spatial light modulator (SLM) whose propagated optical field reproduces a desired intensity distribution. In the far-field (Fraunhofer) regime, optical propagation reduces to a Fourier transform, such that each hologram pixel contributes to the entire reconstructed intensity distribution. When restricted to phase-only modulation, intensity must be shaped through global phase interference effects, making the inverse mapping from target intensity to phase highly non-linear and sensitive to local minima. We present a proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop approach in which a transformer maps a target intensity image to a phase-only SLM field and is trained end-to-end through exact FFT-based propagation embedded directly within optimization. We further observe that patch tokenization strongly shapes the optimization geometry: coarse tokenization acts as an implicit spectral regularizer that stabilizes training and suppresses checkerboard-like attractors, while finer tokenization increases spatial degrees of freedom but benefits from curriculum or hierarchical refinement. Despite training on limited primitives and a single digit class (only digit 6), the learned generator exhibits out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen digits and hand-drawn target patterns. These results suggest that transformer architectures, whose self-attention enables global token interactions, are a natural fit for far-field holography and provide a viable foundation for scalable physics-grounded hologram generation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dark Matter Searches Using Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) with masses of order an electronvolt or below can have a non-zero coupling to electromagnetism while being compatible with cosmological observations. In these models, the ambient DM behaves as a new classical source in Maxwell's equations, which can excite potentially detectable electromagnetic (EM) fields in the laboratory. We propose a new integrated photonics-based approach to search for DM candidates in the 0.1 - few eV mass range. This approach offers a wide range of wavelength-scale devices like resonators and waveguides that are readily fabricated in large quantities, enabling a scalable and novel search. In particular, we demonstrate that refractive index-modulated resonators, such as etched/grooved microrings, or patterned slabs, support EM modes with efficient coupling to DM. When excited by DM, these modes are read out by coupling the resonators to a waveguide that terminates on a micron-scale-sized single photon detector, such as a single pixel of a low-noise charge-coupled device or a superconducting nanowire. We then estimate the sensitivity of this experimental concept in the context of axion-like particle and dark photon models of DM, demonstrating that nanophotonic confinement and scalability can extend dark matter sensitivity into previously unexplored parameter space.</description>
