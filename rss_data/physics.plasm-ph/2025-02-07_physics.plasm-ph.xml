      <title>Numerical study on wave attenuation via 2D fully kinetic electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation and absorption of electromagnetic waves in plasma is one of the fundamental issues in plasma physics. The electromagnetic particle-in-cell method with the finite-difference time-domain solver plus Monte Carlo collision model would be the most accurate method to simulate the wave-plasma interaction. However, the numerical effects of this method have not been carefully investigated especially in two dimensions. In this paper, the 2D PIC method is used to study the electromagnetic wave attenuation by fluorescent lamp plasma tubes. The study finds that the number of macro-particles and the incident electromagnetic wave amplitude have minor effects on the wave attenuation within a certain appropriate parameter range. Furthermore, the effects of electromagnetic wave frequency, the plasma distribution structures, and collision types on wave attenuation are investigated. Particularly, it is found that the staggered way of arranging the plasma tubes can achieve better wave attenuation than the parallel way, which agrees with our recent experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Inhibition and promotion of quasi-uniform to filamentary discharge transition in negative repetitive nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from quasi-uniform to filamentary modes in a repetitive nanosecond Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge(SDBD) under atmospheric pressure was studied. Our focus encompassed both discharge morphology and electrical characteristics, revealing two pivotal findings. Firstly, by analyzing the current and the deposited energy waveforms, three characteristic frequency ranges respectively corresponding to the discharge modes are identified. Notably, within the 5 kHz to 8 kHz range, we observed non-monotonic changes in the propagation distance, the current amplitude, and the deposited energy - a crucial insight linked to the discharge transition. Secondly, the count of current extrema in the primary discharge process changes only during the transition to filamentary mode, remaining stable in the steady discharge mode. This variation may be attributed to secondary Surface Ionization Waves (SIWs). The interplay of these two findings with the discharge transition requires deeper investigation. Additionally, we present a discharge modes control curve outlining parameter windows for the discharge modes. This curve facilitates the optimization of pulse power supply and control schemes in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Fundamental mechanisms of high-electric-field vacuum arc initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review brings together a body of experimental, theoretical, and simulation work addressing the behaviour of high-field devices and the fundamental process of vacuum arcing, also referred to as vacuum breakdown. Detailed experimental observations and results relating to a wide range of aspects of high-field devices including conditioning, field and temperature dependence of breakdown rate, and the field-holding capability as a function of device geometry and of different materials are presented. The different observations are then addressed theoretically, and with simulation, capturing the sequence of processes that lead to vacuum breakdown and explaining the major observed experimental dependencies. The core of the work described in this review was carried out by a broad multi-disciplinary collaboration in an over a decade-long program to develop high-gradient, 100 MV/m-range, accelerating structures for the CLIC project, a possible future linear-collider high-energy physics facility. Connections are made to the broader linear collider, high-field, and breakdown communities.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection in a Compact Magnetic Dome: Peculiar Emissions and High-velocity Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales is a fundamental driver of energy release and plasma dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere. We present novel observations of a brightening in an active region, captured in high-resolution data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) using the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). The event exhibits Ellerman bomb-like morphology in the H$\beta$ filter, associated with flux cancellation between a small negative polarity patch adjacent to opposite-polarity plage. Additionally, it displays a distinct annular emission pattern in Ca II K, hot jet-like structures containing Alfv\'enic plasma flows, and cooler surges. We employ multi-line, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions of the spectropolarimetric data to infer the stratification of the physical parameters of the atmosphere. Furthermore, we use the photospheric vector magnetogram inferred from the ViSP spectra as a boundary condition for nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, revealing the three-dimensional distribution of squashing factors. We find significant enhancements in temperature, velocity, and microturbulence confined to the upper photosphere and low chromosphere. Our findings provide observational evidence of low-altitude magnetic reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers in a compact fan-spine-type configuration, highlighting the complex interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and plasma flows. Finally, we discuss the potential role of nonthermal particles in the distinct emissions at different wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Construction of an invertible mapping to boundary conforming coordinates for arbitrarily shaped toroidal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundary conforming coordinates are commonly used in plasma physics to describe the geometry of toroidal domains, for example, in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium solvers. The magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium configuration can be approximated with an inverse map, defining nested surfaces of constant magnetic flux. For equilibrium solvers that solve for this inverse map iteratively, the initial guess for the inverse map must be well defined and invertible. Even if magnetic islands are to be included in the representation, boundary conforming coordinates can still be useful, for example to parametrize the interface surfaces in multi-region, relaxed magnetohydrodynamics or as a general-purpose, field-agnostic coordinate system in strongly shaped domains. Given a fixed boundary shape, finding a valid boundary conforming mapping can be challenging, especially for the non-convex boundaries from recent developments in stellarator optimization. In this work, we propose a new algorithm to construct such a mapping, by solving two Dirichlet-Laplace problems via a boundary integral method. We can prove that the generated harmonic map is always smooth and has a smooth inverse. Furthermore, we can find a discrete approximation of the mapping that preserves this property.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en pulse at chromospheric footpoints of magnetic loops and generation of the super-Dreicer electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfv\'en pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. The electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfv\'en wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e., accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined on the basis of the perturbation theory and specified to the case of a magnetic flux tube homogeneous over its cross section. For the chromospheric tubes, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decrease, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>

      <title>Small-scale inhomogeneity effects on coherent solar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in solar physics. To clarify the mechanism(s) of different types of solar radio bursts, (radio) wave excitation by energetic electrons in homogeneous plasmas has been widely studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) code numerical simulations. The solar corona is, however, inhomogeneous over almost all spatial scales. Inhomogeneities of the plasma could influence the emission properties of solar radio bursts. In this paper, we, hence, investigate effects of inhomogeneity (in the magnetic field, plasma density and temperature) of plasmas in the solar corona on radio wave emission by ring-beam distributed energetic electrons utilizing 2.5-dimensional PIC simulations. Both the beam and electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instabilities could be triggered with the presence of the energetic ring-beam electrons. The resultant spectrum of the excited electromagnetic waves presents a zebra-stripe pattern in the frequency space. The inhomogeneous density or temperature in plasmas influences the frequency bandwidth and location of these excited waves. Our results can, hence, help to diagnose the plasma properties at the emission sites of solar radio bursts. Applications of our results to the solar radio bursts with zebra-stripe pattern are discussed.</description>
