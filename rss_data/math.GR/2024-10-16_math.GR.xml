      <title>Principal ideals in a plactic monoid always intersect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a proof that two principal ideals in a plactic monoid always intersect. Namely, this means that the plactic monoids are both left and right reversible. To the author's knowledge, this result has not yet appeared in the literature studying this monoid. This result holds for both finite rank plactic monoids and the infinite rank plactic monoid.</description>

      <title>Uniformly semi-rational simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite group $G$ is called uniformly semi-rational if there exists an integer $r$ such that the generators of every cyclic sugroup $\langle x \rangle$ of $G$ lie in at most two conjugacy classes, namely $x^G$ or $(x^r)^G$. In this paper, we provide a classification of uniformly semi-rational non-abelian simple groups with particular focus on alternating groups.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence of endomorphism rings and automorphism groups of periodic Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the endomorphism rings End A and End A' of periodic infinite Abelian groups A and A' are elementarily equivalent if and only if the endomorphism rings of their p-components are elementarily equivalent for all primes p. Additionally, we show that the automorphism groups Aut A and Aut A' of periodic Abelian groups A and A' that do not have 2-components and do not contain cocyclic p-components are elementarily equivalent if and only if, for any prime p, the corresponding p-components A_p and A_p' of A and A' are equivalent in second-order logic if they are not reduced, and are equivalent in second-order logic bounded by the cardinalities of their basic subgroups if they are reduced. For such groups A and A', their automorphism groups are elementarily equivalent if and only if their endomorphism rings are elementarily equivalent, and the automorphism groups of the corresponding p-components for all primes p are elementarily equivalent.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing elements and complex group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\mathrm{Irr}(G)$ denote the set of irreducible complex characters of $G$. An element $x$ of $G$ is said to be vanishing, if for some $\chi$ in $\mathrm{Irr}(G)$, we have $\chi(x)=0$. Also the element $x$ is called rational if $x$ is conjugate to $x^i$ for every integer $i$ co-prime to the order of $x$. We define the weight of $G$ as $\omega(G):=(\sum_{\chi\in \mathrm{Irr}(G)}\chi(1))^2/|G|$. In this paper, we show that for every rational non-vanishing element $x\in G$, the order of $C_G(x)$ is at least $\omega(G)$.</description>

      <title>The orbit-fixing deformation spaces of an action of a Lie groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbit-fixing deformation spaces of $C^\infty$ locally free actions of simply connected Lie groups on closed $C^\infty$ manifolds have been studied by several authors. In this paper we reformulate the deformation space by imitating the Teichm\"{u}ller space of a surface. The new formulation seems to be more appropriate for actions of Lie groups which are not simply connected. We also consider actions which may not be locally free, and generalize the deformation spaces for actions of Lie groupoids. Furthermore by using bornologies on Lie groupoids, we make the definition of the deformation space more suitable to deal with actions on noncompact manifolds. In this generality we prove that "cocycle rigidity" implies the deformation space is a point. We compute the deformation space of the action of $\mathop{\mathrm{PSL}}(2,\mathbb{R})$ on $\Gamma\backslash\mathop{\mathrm{PSL}}(2,\mathbb{R})$ by right multiplication for a torsion free cocompact lattice $\Gamma$ in $\mathop{\mathrm{PSL}}(2,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>5-Engel Lie algebras II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In my article 5-Engel algebras published on the arXiv in 2023 I proved that 5-Engel Lie algebras of characteristic zero or prime characteristic $p&gt;7$ are nilpotent of class at most 11. In this note I investigate the ideal ID$(x)$ generated by an element $x$ in a 5-Engel Lie algebra. In characteristic 2 and 3 this ideal does not have to be nilpotent. For all primes $p&gt;3$ I show that Id$(x)$ is nilpotent in 5-Engel Lie algebras of characteristic $p$, and I obtain explicit (best possible) bounds on the nilpotency class.</description>

      <title>An integral formula for Lie groups, and the Mathieu conjecture reduced to Abelian non-Lie conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit integration formula for the Haar integral on a compact connected Lie group. This formula relies on a known decomposition of a compact connected simple Lie group into symplectic leaves, when one views the group as a Poisson Lie group. In this setting the Haar integral is constructed using the Kostant harmonic volume form on the corresponding flag manifold, and explicit coordinates are known for these invariant differential forms. The formula obtained is related to one found by Reshetikhin-Yakimov.
  Using our integration formula, we reduce the Mathieu conjecture to two stronger conjectures about Laurent polynomials in several complex variables with polynomial coefficients in several real variable polynomials. In these stronger conjectures there is no reference to Lie group theory.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary residual finiteness and conjugacy separability growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Henry Bradford showed that all sufficiently fast growing functions appear as the residual finiteness growth function of some group. In this paper we show that the groups there constructed are conjugacy separable and that their conjugacy separability growth is equal to the residual finiteness growth. It follows that all sufficiently fast growing functions appear as the conjugacy separability growth function of some group. We extend this construction to a new class of groups such that given functions $f_1,f_2$ under the same constraints and satisfying $f_2\geq f_1$, we can find a group such that the residual finiteness growth is given by $f_1$ and the conjugacy separability growth by $f_2$, showing that the residual finiteness growth and conjugacy separability growth behave independently and can lie arbitrarily far apart.</description>

      <title>Measurable splittings and the measured group theoretic structure of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group that admits an essential measurable splitting (for instance, any group measure equivalent to a free product of nontrivial groups).
  We show that, for any two nontrivial measure equivalent groups $A$ and $B$, the wreath product groups $A\wr\Gamma$ and $B\wr\Gamma$ are orbit equivalent -- this is interesting even in the case when the groups $A$ and $B$ are finite.
  On the other hand, we show that certain wreath product actions are not even stably orbit equivalent if $\Gamma$ is instead assumed to be a sofic icc group that is Bernoulli superrigid, and $A$ and $B$ have different cardinalities.</description>

      <title>Operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Poisson boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain an operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $\operatorname{L}(\Gamma) \subset \operatorname{L}(\Gamma \curvearrowright B)$ associated with an admissible probability measure $\mu \in \operatorname{Prob}(\Gamma)$ for which the $(\Gamma, \mu)$-Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $(B, \nu_B)$ is uniquely $\mu$-stationary. This is a noncommutative generalization of Nevo-Sageev's structure theorem [NS11]. We apply this result in combination with previous works to provide further evidence towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices.</description>

      <title>Simplices of maximally amenable extensions in II$_1$ factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ we obtain a separable II$_1$ factor $M$ and a maximally abelian subalgebra $A\subset M$ such that the space of maximally amenable extensions of $A$ in $M$ is affinely identified with the $n$ dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-simplex. This moreover yields first examples of masas in II$_1$ factors $A\subset M$ admitting exactly $n$ maximally amenable factorial extensions. Our examples of such $M$ are group von Neumann algebras of free products of lamplighter groups amalgamated over the acting group. A conceptual ingredient that goes into obtaining this result is a simultaneous relative asymptotic orthogonality property, extending prior works in the literature. The proof uses technical tools including our uniform-flattening strategy for commutants in ultrapowers of II$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>Limit trees for free group automorphisms: universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To any free group automorphism, we associate a universal (cone of) limit tree(s) with three defining properties: first, the tree has a minimal isometric action of the free group with trivial arc stabilizers; second, there is a unique expanding dilation of the tree that represents the free group automorphism; and finally, the loxodromic elements are exactly the elements that weakly limit to dominating attracting laminations under forward iteration by the automorphism. So the action on the tree detects the automorphism's dominating exponential dynamics.
  As a corollary, our previously constructed limit pretree that detects the exponential dynamics is canonical. We also characterize all very small trees that admit an expanding homothety representing a given automorphism. In the appendix, we prove a variation of Feighn--Handel's recognition theorem for atoroidal outer automorphisms.</description>

      <title>On the unitary representation theory of locally compact contraction groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unitary representation theory of locally compact contraction groups and their semi-direct products with $\mathbb{Z}$ is studied. We put forward the problem of completely characterising such groups which are type I or CCR and this article provides a stepping stone towards a solution to this problem. In particular, we determine new examples of type I and non-type-I groups in this class, and we completely classify the irreducible unitary representations of the torsion-free groups, which are shown to be type I. When these groups are totally disconnected, they admit a faithful action by automorphisms on an infinite locally-finite regular tree; this work thus provides new examples of automorphism groups of regular trees with interesting representation theory, adding to recent work on this topic.</description>
