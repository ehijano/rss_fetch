      <title>Data complexity signature predicts quantum projected learning benefit for antibiotic resistance</title>

Abstract: This study presents the first large-scale empirical evaluation of quantum machine learning for predicting antibiotic resistance in clinical urine cultures. Antibiotic resistance is amongst the top threats to humanity, and inappropriate antibiotic use is a main driver of resistance. We developed a Quantum Projective Learning (QPL) approach and executed 60 qubit experiments on IBM Eagle and Heron quantum processing units. While QPL did not consistently outperform classical baselines, potentially reflecting current quantum hardware limitations, it did achieve parity or superiority in specific scenarios, notably for the antibiotic nitrofurantoin and selected data splits, revealing that quantum advantage may be data-dependent. Analysis of data complexity measures uncovered a multivariate signature, which comprised Shannon entropy, Fisher Discriminant Ratio, standard deviation of kurtosis, number of low-variance features, and total correlations. The multivariate model accurately (AUC = 0.88, $p$-value = 0.03) distinguished cases wherein QPL executed on quantum hardware would outperform classical models. This signature suggests that quantum kernels excel in feature spaces with high entropy and structural complexity. These findings point to complexity-driven adaptive model selection as a promising strategy for optimizing hybrid quantum-classical workflows in healthcare. Overall, this investigation marks the first application of quantum machine learning in urology, and in antibiotic resistance prediction. Further, this work highlights conditional quantum utility and introduces a principled approach for leveraging data complexity signatures to guide quantum machine learning deployment in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Towards mathematical spaces for biological processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics relies on mathematical spaces carefully matched to the phenomena under study. Phase space in classical mechanics, Hilbert space in quantum theory, configuration spaces in field theory all provide representations in which physical laws, stability and invariants become expressible and testable. In contrast, biology lacks an agreed-upon notion of space capturing context dependence, partial observability, degeneracy and irreversible dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce a unified mathematical space tailored to biological processes where states are represented in locally convex spaces indexed by context, where context includes both environment and history. Within our setting, proximity is defined through families of seminorms rather than a single global metric, allowing biological relevance to vary across conditions. Admissible sets encode biological constraints, observation maps formalize partial observability and many-to-one relations between state and dynamics capture irreversibility without requiring convergence to fixed points. Stabilization is characterized by neighborhood inclusion and degeneracy arises naturally through quotient structures induced by observation. We develop explicit constructions, operators and bounds within this space, yielding quantitative predictions dictated by its structure. A worked example based on EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer shows how single-cell data can be mapped into our framework, how numerical thresholds can be calibrated from the literature and how testable predictions can be formulated concerning rare tolerant states, context-dependent proximity and early stabilization. Overall, by providing biology with a space playing a role analogous to those used in physics, we aim to support structurally grounded and quantitative analyses of biological systems across contexts.</description>
