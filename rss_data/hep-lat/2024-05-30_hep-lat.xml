      <title>Neural Network Gauge Field Transformation for 4D SU(3) gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct neural networks that work for any Lie group and maintain gauge covariance, enabling smooth, invertible gauge field transformations. We implement these transformations for 4D SU(3) lattice gauge fields and explore their use in HMC. We focus on developing loss functions and optimizing the transformations. We show the effects on HMC's molecular dynamics and discuss the scalability of the approach.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the pion distribution amplitude with domain wall fermions at physical pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a direct lattice QCD calculation of the $x$-dependence of the pion distribution amplitude (DA), which is performed using the quasi-DA in large momentum effective theory on a domain-wall fermion ensemble at physical quark masses and spacing $a\approx 0.084$ fm. The bare quais-DA matrix elements are renormalized in the hybrid scheme and matched to $\overline{\rm MS}$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. For the first time, we include threshold resummation in the perturbative matching onto the light-cone DA, which resums the large logarithms in the soft gluon limit at next-to-next-to-leading log. The resummed results show controlled scale-variation uncertainty within the range of momentum fraction $x\in[0.25,0.75]$ at the largest pion momentum $P_z\approx 1.85$~GeV. In addition, we apply the same analysis to quasi-DAs from a highly-improved-staggered-quark ensemble at physical pion mass and $a=0.076$ fm. By comparison we find with $2\sigma$ confidence level that the DA obtained from chiral fermions is flatter and lower near $x=0.5$.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from preheating with scale dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the formalism to calculate non-Gaussianity of primordial curvature perturbations produced by preheating in the presence of a light scalar field. The calculation is carried out in the separate universe approximation using the non-perturbative delta N formalism and lattice field theory simulations. Initial conditions for simulations are drawn from a statistical ensemble determined by modes that left the horizon during inflation, with the time-dependence of Hubble rate during inflation taken into account. Our results show that cosmic variance, i.e., the contribution from modes with wavelength longer than the size of the observable universe today, plays a key role in determining the dominant contribution. We illustrate our formalism by applying it to an observationally-viable preheating model motivated by non-minimal coupling to gravity, and study its full parameter dependence.</description>

      <title>The metamorphosis of semi-classical mechanisms of confinement: From monopoles on ${\mathbb R}^3 \times S^1$ to center-vortices on ${\mathbb R}^2 \times T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are two distinct regimes of Yang-Mills theory where we can demonstrate confinement, the existence of a mass gap, and fractional theta angle dependence using a reliable semi-classical calculation. The two regimes are Yang-Mills theory on $S^1 \times {\mathbb R}^3$ with a small circle and a double-trace deformation, and Yang-Mills theory on $T^2 \times {\mathbb R}^2$ where the torus $T^2$ is small and threaded by a 't Hooft flux. In the first case the confinement mechanism is related to self-dual monopoles, whereas in the second case self-dual center-vortices play a crucial role. These two topological objects are distinct. In particular, they have different mutual statistics with Wilson loops. On the other hand, they carry the same topological charge and action. On ${\mathbb R \times T^2 \times S^1}$, we are able to extrapolate both monopole regime and vortex regime to a quantum mechanical domain, where a cross-over takes place. Both sides of the cross-over are described by a deformed $\mathbb Z_N$ TQFT. On ${\mathbb R^2 \times S^1 \times S^1}$, we derive the effective field theory of vortices from the effective theory of monopoles in the presence of a 't Hooft flux. This results from a two-stage adjoint Higgs mechanism, to $U(1)^{N-1}$ in 3d first and a $\mathbb Z_N$ EFT in 2d second. This proves adiabatic continuity of the two confinement mechanisms across dimensions and shows how monopoles and their magnetic flux transmute into center-vortices. This basic mechanism is flux fractionalization: The magnetic flux of the monopoles fractionalizes and collimates in such a way that 2d Wilson loops detect it as a center vortex.</description>
