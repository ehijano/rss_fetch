      <title>Linear Extensions of Rotor-Routing in Directed Graphs: Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a linear extension of the rotor-routing model in directed graphs, akin to the sandpile model and vector addition systems, together with new rotor mechanisms that extend standard cyclic rotors. In this framework, rotor-routing is interpreted as the simultaneous movement of particles accross two coupled graphs, involving both vertex and arc-based particles. The standard, combinatorial rotor-routing of positive particles (legal routing) based on rotor-configurations, then becomes a special case of a linear equivalence. We give comprehensive reachability results characterizing legal routings among linear equivalences, expanding on previous results, and settle the algorithmic complexities associated with these problems.</description>

      <title>Extremal Problems on Forest Cuts and Acyclic Neighborhoods in Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chernyshev, Rauch, and Rautenbach proved that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{11}{5}n-\frac{18}{5}$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest, and conjectured that the same remains true if the graph has less than $3n-6$ edges. We improve their result by proving that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{9}{4}n$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest. We also study weaker versions of the problem that might lead to an improvement on the bound obtained.</description>

      <title>A Faster Deterministic Algorithm for Mader's $\mathcal{S}$-Path Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ with a set of terminals $T\subseteq V$ partitioned into a family $\mathcal{S}$ of disjoint blocks, find the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths whose endpoints belong to two distinct blocks while no other internal vertex is a terminal. This problem is called Mader's $\mathcal{S}$-path packing. It has been of remarkable interest as a common generalization of the non-bipartite matching and vertex-disjoint $s\text{-}t$ paths problem.
  This paper presents a new deterministic algorithm for this problem via known reduction to linear matroid parity. The algorithm utilizes the augmenting-path algorithm of Gabow and Stallmann (1986), while replacing costly matrix operations between augmentation steps with a faster algorithm that exploits the original $\mathcal{S}$-path packing instance. The proposed algorithm runs in $O(mnk)$ time, where $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$, and $k = |T|\le n$. This improves on the previous best bound $O(mn^{\omega})$ for deterministic algorithms, where $\omega\ge2$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent.</description>

      <title>Flow Shop Scheduling with Inter-Stage Flexibility and Blocking Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scheduling problem arising from a material handling and processing problem in a production line of an Austrian company building prefabricated house walls. The addressed problem is a permutation flow shop with blocking constraints in which the machine of at least one stage can process a number operations of two other stages in the system. This situation is usually referred to as multi-task or inter-stage flexibility. The problem is in general NP-hard, but we derive a number of special cases that can be solved in polynomial time. For the general case, we present a variety of heuristic algorithms, with a focus on matheuristics that are grounded in two different mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulations of the problem. These matheuristics leverage the strengths of exact optimization techniques while introducing flexibility to address limits on computation time. To assess the performance of the proposed approaches, we conduct an extensive computational study on randomly generated test cases based on real-world instances.</description>

      <title>Parallel Token Swapping for Qubit Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a combinatorial reconfiguration problem that involves finding an optimal sequence of swaps to move an initial configuration of tokens that are placed on the vertices of a graph to a final desired one. This problem arises as a crucial step in reducing the depth of a quantum circuit when compiling a quantum algorithm. We provide the first known constant factor approximation algorithms for the parallel token swapping problem on graph topologies that are commonly found in modern quantum computers, including cycle graphs, subdivided star graphs, and grid graphs. We also study the so-called stretch factor of a natural lower bound to the problem, which has been shown to be useful when designing heuristics for the qubit routing problem. Finally, we study the colored version of this reconfiguration problem where some tokens share the same color and are considered indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Recoverable Robust Optimization in the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recoverable robust optimization is a popular multi-stage approach, in which it is possible to adjust a first-stage solution after the uncertain cost scenario is revealed. We consider recoverable robust optimization in combination with discrete budgeted uncertainty. In this setting, it seems plausible that many problems become $\Sigma^p_3$-complete and therefore it is impossible to find compact IP formulations of them (unless the unlikely conjecture NP $= \Sigma^p_3$ holds). Even though this seems plausible, few concrete results of this kind are known. In this paper, we fill that gap of knowledge. We consider recoverable robust optimization for the nominal problems of Sat, 3Sat, vertex cover, dominating set, set cover, hitting set, feedback vertex set, feedback arc set, uncapacitated facility location, $p$-center, $p$-median, independent set, clique, subset sum, knapsack, partition, scheduling, Hamiltonian path/cycle (directed/undirected), TSP, $k$-disjoint path ($k \geq 2$), and Steiner tree. We show that for each of these problems, and for each of three widely used distance measures, the recoverable robust problem becomes $\Sigma^p_3$-complete. Concretely, we show that all these problems share a certain abstract property and prove that this property implies that their robust recoverable counterpart is $\Sigma^p_3$-complete. This reveals the insight that all the above problems are $\Sigma^p_3$-complete 'for the same reason'. Our result extends a recent framework by Gr\"une and Wulf.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology: From Generalized Morse-Smale Dynamical Systems to Forman's Combinatorial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

      <title>First Order Logic and Twin-Width in Tournaments and Dense Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the classes of tournaments with tractable first-order model checking. For every hereditary class of tournaments $\mathcal T$, first-order model checking is either fixed parameter tractable or $\textrm{AW}[*]$-hard. This dichotomy coincides with the fact that $\mathcal T$ has either bounded or unbounded twin-width, and that the growth of $\mathcal T$ is either at most exponential or at least factorial. From the model-theoretic point of view, we show that NIP classes of tournaments coincide with bounded twin-width. Twin-width is also characterised by three infinite families of obstructions: $\mathcal T$ has bounded twin-width if and only if it excludes at least one tournament from each family. This generalises results of Bonnet et al. on ordered graphs. The key for these results is a polynomial time algorithm which takes as input a tournament $T$ and computes a linear order $&lt;$ on $V(T)$ such that the twin-width of the birelation $(T,&lt;)$ is at most some function of the twin-width of $T$. Since approximating twin-width can be done in polynomial time for an ordered structure $(T,&lt;)$, this provides a polynomial time approximation of twin-width for tournaments. Our results extend to oriented graphs with stable sets of bounded size, which may also be augmented by arbitrary binary relations.</description>

      <title>Completeness in the Polynomial Hierarchy for many natural Problems in Bilevel and Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In bilevel and robust optimization we are concerned with combinatorial min-max problems, for example from the areas of min-max regret robust optimization, network interdiction, most vital vertex problems, blocker problems, and two-stage adjustable robust optimization. Even though these areas are well-researched for over two decades and one would naturally expect many (if not most) of the problems occurring in these areas to be complete for the classes $\Sigma^p_2$ or $\Sigma^p_3$ from the polynomial hierarchy, almost no hardness results in this regime are currently known. However, such complexity insights are important, since they imply that no polynomial-sized integer program for these min-max problems exist, and hence conventional IP-based approaches fail. We address this lack of knowledge by introducing over 70 new $\Sigma^p_2$-complete and $\Sigma^p_3$-complete problems. The majority of all earlier publications on $\Sigma^p_2$- and $\Sigma^p_3$-completeness in said areas are special cases of our meta-theorem. Precisely, we introduce a large list of problems for which the meta-theorem is applicable (including clique, vertex cover, knapsack, TSP, facility location and many more). We show that for every single of these problems, the corresponding min-max (i.e. interdiction/regret) variant is $\Sigma^p_2$- and the min-max-min (i.e. two-stage) variant is $\Sigma^p_3$-complete.</description>
