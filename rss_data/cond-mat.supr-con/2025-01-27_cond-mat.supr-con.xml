      <title>Non-Topological Edge-Localized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov States in CrBr$_3$/NbSe$_2$ Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity is predicted to emerge in certain magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. Here, we revisit the heterostructure of insulating monolayer CrBr$_3$ and NbSe$_2$, for which different conclusions on the presence of topological superconductivity have been reported. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and (shot noise) spectroscopy, we find that the superconducting gap well inside the CrBr3 islands is not affected by magnetism. At the island edges, we observe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states at a variety of in-gap positions, including zero energy. The absence of topological superconductivity is verified by extensive dI/dV measurements at the CrBr$_3$ island edges. Our results ask for a more detailed understanding of the interaction between magnetic insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Prerequisite of superconductivity: SDW rather than tetragonal structure in double-layer La3Ni2O7-x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure-induced high-temperature superconductivity(Tc) in nickelates La3Ni2O7-x has sparked significant interest to explore its superconductivity at ambient pressure.Lan+1NinO3n+1(n=2,3)adopts an orthorhombic structure with tilted NiO6 octahedra and undergoes a spin-density-wave(SDW) transition at ambient pressure, while the octahedral tilting and the SDW are suppressed by pressure, and high pressure induces a structural transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal, and the high-Tc superconductivity is achieved in the tetragonal structure. This tetragonal structure is widely believed to be crucial for the pressure-induced superconductivity. Whether the pressure-stabilized tetragonal structure is a prerequisite for achieving nickelate superconductivity at ambient pressure is under hot debate. Here, by post-annealing of the orthorhombic La3Ni2O7-x as grown microcrystals with noticeable oxygen defects in high oxygen pressure environment, tetragonal La3Ni2O6.96 single crystals are successfully obtained at ambient pressure. In contrast to the orthorhombic La3Ni2O7-x, the tetragonal La3Ni2O7-x exhibits metallic behavior without a SDW transition at ambient pressure. Moreover, no superconductivity is observed at high pressure up to ~ 70 GPa. On the other hand, by utilizing Helium as the pressure medium, we have revisited the superconducting structure in pressurized orthorhombic La3Ni2O6.93. Our results indicate that the orthorhombic structure is quite robust against pressure, and no structural transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal happens, and the superconductivity under high pressure is achieved in orthorhombic structure rather than tetragonal structure claimed previously. All these results suggest that tetragonal structure is not prerequisite for achieving superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-x.</description>

      <title>Optical Response of Multi-orbital Superconductors: Role of Fermi Surface Topology and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the possibility of shifting the nearest peak in the density of states relative to the Fermi level leading to a Lifshitz transition, such as through strain in Sr$^{}_2$RuO$^{}_4$, this study examines the consequent effects on Hall transport and the polar Kerr angle. Using a three-orbital model, variations in the chemical potential and $z$-direction hopping reveal $d+ig$- and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairings as leading candidates for pairing symmetry in the quasi-2D orbital within the weak-coupling regime. The Lifshitz transition is further analyzed for its impact on coherence factors and the density of states, both of which are crucial to response functions. Interactions with van Hove points and nearby degenerate electronic states emerge as key contributors to Hall-type responses, while electron transfer between quasi-1D and quasi-2D orbitals significantly modifies these transport properties.</description>

      <title>Conditions for orbital-selective altermagnetism in Sr2RuO4: tight-binding model, similarities with cuprates, and implications for superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.</description>

      <title>A chemical bonding based descriptor for predicting the impact of quantum nuclear and anharmonic effects on hydrogen-based superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nuclear effects (QNEs) can significantly alter a material's crystal structure and phonon spectra, impacting properties such as thermal conductivity and superconductivity. However, predicting a priori whether these effects will enhance or suppress superconductivity, or destabilize a structure, remains a grand challenge. Herein, we address this unresolved problem by introducing a descriptor, based upon the integrated crystal orbital bonding index (iCOBI), to predict the influence of QNEs on a crystal lattice's dynamic stability, phonon spectra and superconducting properties. We find that structures with atoms in symmetric chemical bonding environments exhibit greater resilience to structural perturbations induced by QNEs, while those with atoms in asymmetric bonding environments are more susceptible to structural alterations, resulting in enhanced superconducting critical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Meissner Effect and Flux Trapping of Superconductors under High Pressure using N-V Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure is a key parameter for tuning or revealing superconductivity in materials and compounds. Many measurements of superconducting phase transition temperatures have been conducted using diamond anvil cells (DACs), which provide a wide pressure range and enable concomitant microscopic structural characterization of the sample. However, the inherently small sample volumes in DACs complicate the unambiguous detection of the Meissner effect, the hallmark of superconductivity. Recently, the Meissner effect in superconductors within a DAC was successfully demonstrated using diamond nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) widefield magnetometry, a non-invasive optical technique. In this work, we show that N-V magnetometry can also map superconductivity with micrometer resolution. We apply this technique to a microcrystal of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) mercury-based cuprate superconductor under 4 GPa of pressure. The method is capable to detect the magnetic field expulsion and heterogeneities in the sample, visible in a set of characteristic parameters as the local critical temperature $T_{c}$. Flux pinning zones are identified through flux trapping maps. This approach could enable detailed investigations of superconductivity of a broad range of materials under high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Designing edge currents using mesoscopic patterning in chiral d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are topological as characterized by a finite Chern number and chiral edge modes. Direct fingerprints of chiral superconductivity is thus often taken to be spontaneous edge currents with associated magnetic signatures. However, a number of recent theoretical studies have shown that the total edge current along semi-infinite edges is greatly reduced or even vanishes in many scenarios for all pairing symmetries except chiral $p$-wave, thus impeding experimental detection. We demonstrate how mesoscopic finite-sized samples can be designed to give rise to a shape- and size-dependent strong enhancement of the chiral edge currents and their generated orbital magnetic moment and magnetic fields. In particular, we find that low rotational symmetry systems, such as pentagons and hexagons, give rise to the largest currents, while circular disks also generate large currents but in the opposite direction. The current and magnetic signatures diverge with shrinking system sizes, eventually cut-off by finite-size suppression of chiral superconductivity. We thus also extract the full phase diagram as a function of temperature and system size for different geometries, including competing superconducting orders. Our results are relevant for system sizes on the order of tens to hundreds of coherence lengths, and highlight mesoscopic patterning as a viable route to experimentally identify chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been discovered as a high temperature superconductor with Tc near 80 K above 14 GPa.[1-3] The search for nickelate superconductors with higher Tc, the preparation of high-quality single crystals, and the removal of high-pressure conditions including single crystal growth under high gas pressure and achievement of high Tc superconductivity under high pressure, are the most challenging tasks. Here, we present ambient pressure flux growth of high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity up to 91 K under high pressure. Single crystals of bilayer La3-xRxNi2O7-y with dimensions up to 220 um on the edge were successfully grown using flux method at atmosphere conditions. Single crystal X-ray diffraction, nuclear quadrupole resonance, energy dispersion spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements evidenced high quality of bilayer La2SmNi2O7-y single crystals in average structure and local structure. Superconductivity has been observed in high pressure resistivity measurements of annealed La2SmNi2O7-y single crystals with Tc onset up to 91 K, which is the highest among the known superconducting nickelates. Our results not only demonstrate a new and easy-to-access method for synthesizing high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals, but also providing a direction for discovering superconducting nickelates with higher Tc.</description>

      <title>Landscape of Correlated Orders in Strained Bilayer Nickelate Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has sparked significant research interest. This interest has been further fueled by the recent achievement of superconductivity in compressed thin films at ambient pressure, although the origin and underlying mechanism remain elusive. In this work, we explore the electronic structures and instabilities of strained thin films on substrates to identify the key factors for achieving superconductivity, using first-principles and functional renormalization group calculations. Our findings suggest that the compressed NiO$_2$ bilayer near the interface is unlikely to exhibit superconductivity, despite its electron-doped nature. In contrast, the NiO$_2$ bilayer away from the interface shows density-wave instability when undoped or slightly hole-doped. However, when this bilayer is hole-doped, leading to the emergence of a hole pocket around the M point, it exhibits robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, which may account for superconductivity observed in thin films. For the stretched NiO$_2$ bilayer, robust spin-density-wave instability is observed due to enhanced Fermi surface nesting, despite the presence of a hole pocket around the M point. Potential experimental implications are discussed. Our study highlights the crucial role of fermiology in determining electronic instability and establishes a unified scenario for superconductivity in both pressurized bulk and strained thin films of bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking, collective modes, and Raman spectrum in pair-density-wave states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by empirical evidence of the existence of pair-density-wave (PDW) order in certain underdoped cuprates, we investigate the collective modes in systems with unidirectional PDW order with momenta $\pm {Q}$ and a $d$-wave form-factor with special focus on the amplitude (Higgs) modes. In the pure PDW state, there are two overdamped Higgs modes. We show that a phase with co-existing PDW and uniform ($d$-wave) superconducting (SC) order, PDW/SC, spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry - and thus is distinct from a simpler phase, SC/CDW, with coexisting SC and charge-density-wave (CDW) order. The PDW/SC phase exhibits three Higgs modes, one of which is sharply peaked and is predominantly a PDW fluctuation, symmetric between ${Q}$ and -${Q}$, whose damping rate is strongly reduced by SC. This sharp mode should be visible in Raman experiments.</description>

Abstract: Exploring new unconventional superconductors is of great value for both fundamental research and practical applications. It is a long-term challenge to develop and study more hole-doped superconductors in 1111 system of iron-based superconductors. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity with a critical transition temperature up to 30.7 K in the compound CaFeAsF by a post-annealing treatment in air atmosphere. The superconducting behaviors are verified in both the single-crystalline and polycrystalline samples by the resistance and magnetization measurements. The analysis by combining the depth-resolved time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements shows that the introduction of oxygen elements and the consequent changing in Fe valence by the annealing treatment may lead to the hole-type doping, which is the origin for the occurrence of superconductivity. Our results pave the way for further in-depth investigations on the hole-doped 1111 system in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Selective Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer LaNiO$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has ignited stark interest within the scientific community, particularly regarding its likely unconventional origin. Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</description>

      <title>Deeper insight into the terahertz response of conventional superconductors under magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. First, we review theoretical approaches describing the fundamental processes of suppression of superconductivity in magnetic field and how the in-gap states are filled. In the Voigt geometry, thin superconducting films are fully penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the condensate. In this configuration, we provide an alternative description of the recent experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by Lee ${\it et\,al.}$ [Nat. Commun. 14,2737 (2023)], which better fits their data for magnetic fields above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we measured and analyzed the terahertz conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions within a superconducting matrix. In both geometries, the optical conductivity can be comprehensively described by the model of Herman and Hlubina [Phys. Rev. B 96, 014509 (2017)] involving pair-conserving, and magnetic-field-dependent pair-breaking disorder scattering processes.</description>

Abstract: We show that in disordered superconductors, at sufficiently low frequencies $\omega$, the coupling of TLS to external ac electric fields increases dramatically in the presence of a dc supercurrent. This giant enhancement manifests in all ac linear and nonlinear phenomena. In particular, it leads to a parametric enhancement of the real part of the ac conductivity and, consequently, of the equilibrium current fluctuations. If the distribution of TLS relaxation times is broad, the conductivity is inversely proportional to $\omega$, and the spectrum of the equilibrium current fluctuations takes the form of 1/f noise.</description>

      <title>Model for the commensurate charge-density waves in under-hole-doped cuprate superconductors</title>

Abstract: A simple model of the commensurate charge-density wave (CCDW) portion of the underdoped pseudogap regions of monolayer Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6-x}$ (Bi2201), bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212), and trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223) cuprate superconductors is presented and studied. Above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ but below the pseudogap transition temperature $T_p &gt; T_c$, the CCDW forms on the oxygen sites in the CuO$_2$ layers with excess charges of $\pm\delta e$, where $e$ is the electronic charge, forming on alternating oxygen sites. This model is equivalent to $N$-layer versions of the two-dimensional Ising model for spins on a square lattice with repulsive interactions $J' , J&gt;0$ between near-neighbor inter- and intralayer sites, respectively. For strong coupling, we show analytically for sections of $L\times M\times N$ sites that the partition function in the $J'\rightarrow\pm \infty$ limits reduces to that for an effective single layer with $L\times M$ sites and $J$ replaced by $NJ$. The CCDW is therefore strongly enhanced and stabilized by multilayer structures, likely accounting for the enhanced THz emission observed from the intrinsic Josephson junctions in underdoped Bi2212 mesas and for the many experiments on Bi2212 and related compounds purporting to provide evidence for a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry.</description>

      <title>Bipolar Thermoelectric Josephson Engine</title>

Abstract: Thermoelectric effects in metals are typically small due to the nearly-perfect particle-hole (PH) symmetry around their Fermi surface [1, 2]. Despite being initially considered paradoxical [3], thermophase effects [4-8] and linear thermoelectricity [9] in superconducting systems were identified only when PH symmetry is explicitly broken [10-14]. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a superconducting tunnel junction can develop a very large bipolar thermoelectric effect in the presence of a nonlinear thermal gradient thanks to spontaneous PH symmetry breaking [15]. Our junctions show a maximum thermovoltage of $\pm150\; \mu$ V at $\pm650$ mK, directly proportional to the superconducting gap. Notably, the corresponding Seebeck coefficient of $\pm300\; \mu$V/K is roughly $10^5$ times larger than the one expected for a normal metal at the same temperature [16, 17]. Moreover, by integrating our junctions into a Josephson interferometer, we realize a bipolar thermoelectric Josephson engine (BTJE) [18] with phase-coherent thermopower control [19]. When connected to a generic load, the BTJE generates a phase-tunable electric power up to about 140 mW/m$^2$ at subKelvin temperatures. In addition, our device implements the prototype for a persistent thermoelectric memory cell, written or erased by current injection [20]. We expect that our findings will trigger thermoelectricity in PH symmetric systems, and will lead to a number of groundbreaking applications in superconducting electronics [21], cutting-edge quantum technologies [22-24] and sensing [25].</description>

      <title>Wigner representation of Andreev-reflected charge pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the edge states of a quantum Hall sample can be coupled to a superconductor, so that incoming electrons in the edge states can be Andreev converted by the superconductor as coherent superpositions of an electron and a hole. In parallel, single-electron emitters that operate in the gigahertz regime have been realized on quantum Hall edge states. Motivated by this remarkable experimental progress, we here analyze the Andreev reflections of incoming charge pulses on the interface with a superconductor. To this end, we employ a Wigner function representation that allows us to visualize the response function of the interface both in the time and in the frequency domain. We analyze the response of an interface between a normal-metal and a singlet or triplet superconductor with and without an insulating barrier in between them. As a special case, we analyze the Andreev reflections of clean single-particle excitations that are generated by the application of lorentzian-shaped voltage pulses to the contacts of the inputs. Our predictions may be tested in future experiments with edge states coupled to superconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in symmetry-breaking ordered phases of correlated fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phases of many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions representing transient processes during which some characteristics of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Matching the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one consistently with nontrivial quantum dynamics is a long-standing, unresolved problem. We argue that the two-particle propagators may contain only even powers of the anomalous Green functions to make the thermodynamic system conserving. Only then can we continuously match the symmetry-breaking phase with the normal one at the single transition point. We use the antiferromagnetic phase of a dynamical mean-field approximation to disclose universal features of the impact of quantum dynamics on the thermodynamic and spectral properties of the ordered state.</description>
