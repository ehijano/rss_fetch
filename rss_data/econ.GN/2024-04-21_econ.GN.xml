      <title>Sustainable regional economic development and land use: a case of Russia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes sustainable regional economic development and land use employing a case study of Russia. The economics of land management in Russia which is shaped by both historical legacies and contemporary policies represents an interesting conundrum. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia embarked on a thorny and complex path towards the economic reforms and transformation characterized, among all, by the privatization and decentralization of land ownership. This transition was aimed at improving agricultural productivity and fostering sustainable regional economic development but also led to new challenges such as uneven distribution of land resources, unclear property rights, and underinvestment in rural infrastructure. However, managing all of that effectively poses significant challenges and opportunities. With the help of the comprehensive bibliographic network analysis, this study sheds some light on the current state of sustainable regional economic development and land use management in Russia. Its results and outcomes might be helpful for the researchers and stakeholders alike in devising effective strategies aimed at maximizing resources for sustainable land use, particularly within their respective regional economies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying seasonal hydrogen storage demands under cost and market uptake uncertainties in energy system transformation pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate neutrality paradigms put electricity systems at the core of a clean energy supply. At the same time, indirect electrification, with a potential uptake of hydrogen or derived fuel economy, plays a crucial role in decarbonising the energy supply and industrial processes. Besides energy markets coordinating the transition, climate and energy policy targets require fundamental changes and expansions in the energy transmission, import, distribution, and storage infrastructures. While existing studies identify relevant demands for hydrogen, critical decisions involve imports versus domestic fuel production and investments in new or repurposing existing pipeline and storage infrastructure. Linking the pan-European energy system planning model SCOPE SD with the multiperiod European gas market model IMAGINE, the case study analysis and its transformation pathway results indicate extensive network development of hydrogen infrastructure, including expansion beyond refurbished methane infrastructure. However, the ranges of future hydrogen storage costs and market uptake restrictions expose and quantify the uncertainty of its role in Europes transformation. The study finds that rapidly planning the construction of hydrogen storage and pipeline infrastructure is crucial to achieving the required capacity by 2050.</description>

      <title>Understanding Intra-Household Educational Inequalities: Gender, Birth Order, and Ability Dynamics in Benin's Households</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nuanced interplay of gender, birth order, and innate ability in shaping educational disparities among children within households, employing both a reduced-form analysis and a structural model of household resource allocation. By decomposing overall disparities, I identify the contributions of gender, birth order, and innate ability differences. In the context of Benin, for households with non-educated heads and mixed-gender children, total inequality comprises 50% gender disparity, 20% birth order effect, and 30% ability gap. Conversely, in households with only sons or only daughters and non-educated heads, total inequality is predominantly driven by ability disparities 70% for daughters and 83% for sons, with lesser contributions from birth order effects. Furthermore, my analysis reveals that in households with non-educated heads, firstborn daughters surpass their younger brothers in educational attainment on the intensive margin if their innate ability exceeds their brothers' by at least 13%, a figure reduced to 8% in households with college-educated parents. Additionally, the study unveils parental preferences favoring sons' education over daughters' among non-educated parents, with a perceived 22% higher average benefit. Targeted policies aimed at reducing composite education costs prove effective in mitigating gender and birth order gaps, albeit with a modest 5% reduction in total inequality. Overall, this research underscores the complex dynamics influencing intra-household educational inequalities and suggests policy avenues to address them.</description>

      <title>Position Uncertainty in a Sequential Public Goods Game: An Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gallice and Monz\'on (2019) present a natural environment that sustains full co-operation in one-shot social dilemmas among a finite number of self-interested agents. They demonstrate that in a sequential public goods game, where agents lack knowledge of their position in the sequence but can observe some predecessors' actions, full contribution emerges in equilibrium due to agents' incentive to induce potential successors to follow suit. In this study, we aim to test the theoretical predictions of this model through an economic experiment. We conducted three treatments, varying the amount of information about past actions that a subject can observe, as well as their positional awareness. Through rigorous structural econometric analysis, we found that approximately 25% of the subjects behaved in line with the theoretical predictions. However, we also observed the presence of alternative behavioural types among the remaining subjects. The majority were classified as conditional co-operators, showing a willingness to cooperate based on others' actions. Some subjects exhibited altruistic tendencies, while only a small minority engaged in free-riding behaviour.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Economics as Successive Approximations of Statistical Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the links between the descriptions of macroeconomic variables and statistical moments of market trade, price, and return. The randomness of market trade values and volumes during the averaging interval {\Delta} results in the random properties of price and return. We describe how averages and volatilities of price and return depend on the averages, volatilities, and correlations of market trade values and volumes. The averages, volatilities, and correlations of market trade, price, and return can behave randomly during the long interval {\Delta}2&gt;&gt;{\Delta}. To describe their statistical properties during the long interval {\Delta}2, we introduce the secondary averaging procedure of trade, price, and return. We explain why, in the coming years, predictions of market-based probabilities of price and return will be limited by Gaussian distributions. We discuss the roots of the internal weakness of the commonly used hedging tool, Value-at-Risk, that cannot be solved and remains the source of additional risks and losses. One should consider theoretical economics as a set of successive approximations, each of which describes the next array of the n-th statistical moments of market trades, price, return, and macroeconomic variables, which are repeatedly averaged during the sequence of increasing time intervals.</description>

      <title>Propagation of a carbon price in a credit portfolio through macroeconomic factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the climate transition through a low-carbon economy, implemented by carbon pricing, propagates in a credit portfolio and precisely describe how carbon price dynamics affects credit risk measures such as probability of default, expected and unexpected losses. We adapt a stochastic multisectoral model to take into account the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions costs of both sectoral firms' production and consumption, as well as sectoral household's consumption. GHG emissions costs are the product of carbon prices, provided by the NGFS transition scenarios, and of GHG emissions. For each sector, our model yields the sensitivity of firms' production and households' consumption to carbon price and the relationships between sectors. It allows us to analyze the short-term effects of the carbon price as opposed to standard IAM (such as REMIND), which are deterministic and only capture long-term trends. Finally, we use a DCF methodology to compute firms' values which we then combine with a structural credit risk model to describe how the carbon price impacts credit risk measures. We obtain that the carbon price distorts the distribution of the firm's value, increases banking fees charged to clients (materialized by the bank provisions), and reduces banks' profitability (translated by the economic capital). In addition, the randomness we introduce provides extra flexibility to take into account uncertainties on the productivity and on the different transition scenarios. We also compute the sensitivities of the credit risk measures with respect to changes in the carbon price, yielding further criteria for a more accurate assessment of climate transition risk in a credit portfolio. This work provides a preliminary methodology to calculate the evolution of credit risk measures of a credit portfolio, starting from a given climate transition scenario described by a carbon price.</description>
