      <title>Meta-heuristic Hypergraph-Assisted Robustness Optimization for Higher-order Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex systems (e.g., communication, transportation, and biological networks), high robustness ensures sustained functionality and stability even when resisting attacks. However, the inherent structure complexity and the unpredictability of attacks make robustness optimization challenging. Hypergraphs provide a framework for modeling complicated higher-order interactions in complex systems naturally, but their potential has not been systematically investigated. Therefore, we propose an effective method based on genetic algorithms from Artificial Intelligence to optimize the robustness of complex systems modeled by hypergraphs. By integrating percolation-based metrics with adaptive computational techniques, our method achieves improved accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating malicious attacks, with robustness improvements ranging from 16.6% to 205.2%. Further in-depth analysis reveals that optimized hypergraph-based systems exhibit a preferential connection mechanism in which high-hyperdegree nodes preferentially connect to lower-cardinality hyperedges, forming a distinctive Lotus topology that significantly improves robustness. Based on this finding, we propose a robust hypergraph generation method that allows robustness to be controlled via a single parameter rb. Notably, for rb&lt;-1, a distinct Cactus topology emerges as an alternative to the Lotus topology observed for rb&gt;1. The discovery of the Lotus and Cactus topologies offers valuable insights for designing robust higher-order networks while providing a useful foundation for investigating cascading failure dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Synergistic motifs in linear Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interdependencies are central features of complex systems, yet a mechanistic explanation for their emergence remains elusive. For linear Gaussian systems of arbitrary dimension, we derive an expression for synergy-dominance in terms of signed network motifs in the system's correlation matrix. We prove that antibalanced correlational structures ensure synergy-dominance and further show that antibalanced triads in the dyadic interaction matrix of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are necessary for synergy-dominance. Our results demonstrate that pairwise interactions alone can give rise to synergistic information in the absence of explicit higher-order mechanisms, and highlight structural balance theory as an instrumental conceptual framework to study higher-order interdependencies.</description>

      <title>Early warning signals in rumor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emission and control of a rumor using the modified Maki-Thomson model. A key challenge in social networks is distinguishing between natural increases in transmissibility and artificial injections of rumor spreaders, such as through broadcast events or astroturfing. Using stochastic simulations, we compare two scenarios: one with organic growth in transmissibility, and another with externally injected spreaders. Although both lead to high autocorrelation, only the organic growth produces oscillatory patterns in autocorrelation at multiple lags, an effect we can analytically explain using the N-intertwined mean-field (NIMFA) approximation. This distinction offers a practical tool to identify the origin of rumor virality and also infer its transmissibility. Our approach is validated analytically and tested on real-world data from Twitter during the announcement of the Higgs boson discovery. In addition to detection, we also explore control strategies. We show that the average lifetime of a rumor can be manipulated through targeted interventions: placing spreaders at specific locations in the network. Depending on their placement, these interventions can either extend or shorten the lifespan of the rumor.</description>

      <title>Critical demand in a stochastic model of flows in supply networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supply networks are essential for modern production, yet their critical properties remain understudied. We present a stochastic model with random production capacities to analyze material flow to a root node, focusing on topology and buffer stocks. The critical demand, where unsatisfied demand diverges, is examined mostly through numerical simulations. Without stocks, minimal production dictates behavior, making topology irrelevant. With stocks, memory effects arise, making topology crucial. Increased local connectivity is beneficial: firms should favor broad, short supply chains over long, narrow ones.</description>

      <title>Rules, agents and order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often exhibit highly structured network topologies that reflect functional constraints. In this work, we investigate how, under varying combinations of system-wide selection rules and special agents, different classes of random processes give rise to global order, with a focus restricted to finite-size networks. Using the large-$N$ Erdos-Renyi model as a null baseline, we contrast purely random link-adding processes with goal-directed dynamics, including variants of the chip-firing model and intracellular network growth, both driven by transport efficiency. Through simulations and structural probes such as $k$-core decomposition and $HITS$ centrality, we show that purely stochastic processes can spontaneously generate modest functional structures, but that significant departures from random behavior generically require two key conditions: critical topological complexity and dynamic alignment between topology and functionality. Our results suggest that the emergence of functional architectures depends not only on the presence of selection mechanisms or specialized roles, but also on the network's capacity to support differentiation and feedback. These findings provide insight into how topology-functionality relationships emerge in natural and artificial systems and offer a framework for using random graph baselines to diagnose the rise of global order in evolving finite-size networks.</description>

      <title>Testing Paradox May Explain Increased Observed Prevalence of Bacterial STIs among MSM on HIV PrEP: A Modeling Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HIV pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has become essential for global HIV control, but its implementation coincides with rising bacterial STI rates among men who have sex with men (MSM). While risk-compensation behavioral changes like reduced condom use are frequently reported, we examine whether intensified asymptomatic screening in PrEP programs creates surveillance artifacts that could be misinterpreted. We developed a compartmental model to represent the simultaneous spread of HIV and chlamydia (as an example of a curable STI), integrating three mechanisms: 1) risk-mediated self-protective behavior, 2) condom use reduction post-PrEP initiation, and 3) PrEP-related asymptomatic STI screening. Increasing PrEP uptake may help to reduce chlamydia prevalence, only if the PrEP-related screening is frequent enough. Otherwise, the effect of PrEP can be disadvantageous, as the drop in self-protective actions caused by larger PrEP uptake cannot be compensated for. Additionally, the change in testing behavior may lead to situations where the trend in the number of positive tests is not a reliable sign of the actual dynamics. We found a plausible mechanism to reconcile conflicting observational evidence on the effect of PrEP on STI rates, showing that simultaneous changes in testing and spreading rates may generate conflicting signals, i.e., that observed trends increase while true prevalence decreases. Asymptomatic screening, together with personalized infection treatment to minimize putative pressure to generate antibiotic resistance, is one of the key determinants of the positive side effects of PrEP in reducing STI incidence.</description>

      <title>Cascades on Constrained Multiplex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a version of the Watts cascade model on directed multiplex configuration model networks, and present a detailed analysis of the cascade size, single-seed cascade probability and cascade condition. We then introduce a smaller class of network models that we call constrained multiplex networks, which allows us to induce patterns in the node activity, i.e. in the participation of nodes on different layers. We find that the choice of induced patterns affects the phase transitions of the cascade model in a variety of ways.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking in minimum dissipation networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both natural and man-made supply networks exhibit universal structural patterns, such as the formation of loops. These patterns can be understood in terms of optimization models, assuming that biological networks evolved to optimal states and technical networks are designed to function optimally. In this article, we analyze networks that minimize dissipation under a research constraint. We demonstrate spontaneous symmetry breaking in optimal network structures as a function of resource scaling. We show that fluctuations intricately impact the structure and can lead to a reentrant transition from a symmetry-broken state to a symmetric state and back again.</description>

      <title>Optimising cryptocurrency portfolios through stable clustering of price correlation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging cryptocurrency market presents unique challenges for investment due to its unregulated nature and inherent volatility. However, collective price movements can be explored to maximise profits with minimal risk using investment portfolios. In this paper, we develop a technical framework that utilises historical data on daily closing prices and integrates network analysis, price forecasting, and portfolio theory to identify cryptocurrencies for building profitable portfolios under uncertainty. Our method utilises the Louvain network community algorithm and consensus clustering to detect robust and temporally stable clusters of highly correlated cryptocurrencies, from which the chosen cryptocurrencies are selected. A price prediction step using the ARIMA model guarantees that the portfolio performs well for up to 14 days in the investment horizon. Empirical analysis over a 5-year period shows that despite the high volatility in the crypto market, hidden price patterns can be effectively utilised to generate consistently profitable, time-agnostic cryptocurrency portfolios.</description>

      <title>Linear inelastic kinetic equations modelling the spread of fake news and its interplay with personal awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a kinetic model which describes a learning process leading individuals to build personal awareness about fake news. Next, we embed the results of this model into another kinetic model, which describes the popularity gained by news on social media conditioned to the reliability of the disseminated information. Both models are formulated in terms of linear inelastic Boltzmann-type equations, of which we investigate the main analytical properties - existence and uniqueness of solutions, trend to equilibrium, identification of the equilibrium distributions - by employing extensively Fourier methods for kinetic equations. We also provide evidence of the analytical results by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>Two-step dimensionality reduction of human mobility data: From potential landscapes to spatiotemporal insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility is crucial for addressing societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Despite advancements in data collection, the complexity and scale of mobility data continue to pose significant analytical challenges. Existing methods often result in losing location-specific details and fail to fully capture the intricacies of human movement. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework to overcome existing limitations. First, we construct a potential landscape of human flow from origin-destination (OD) matrices using combinatorial Hodge theory, preserving essential spatial and structural information while enabling an intuitive visualization of flow patterns. Second, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the potential landscape, systematically identifying major spatiotemporal patterns. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal significant shifts during a pandemic, characterized by an overall declines in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and provide valuable insights into urban planning and public health interventions.</description>
