      <title>The effect of shear-thinning on the scalings and small-scale structures of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous isotropic turbulence of a shear-thinning fluid modeled by the Carreau model and show how the variable viscosity affects the multiscale behaviour of the turbulent flow. We show that Kolmogorov theory can be extended to such non-Newotnian fluids, provided that the correct choice of average is taken when defining the mean Kolmogorov scale and dissipation rate, to properly capture the effect of the variable viscosity. Thus, the classical phenomenology a la Kolmogorov can be observed in the inertial range of scale, with the energy spectra decaying as $k^{-5/3}$ and the third order structure function obeying the $4/5$ law. The changing viscosity instead strongly alters the small scale of turbulence, leading to an enhanced intermittent behavior of the velocity field.</description>

      <title>A framework for learning symbolic turbulence models from indirect observation data via neural networks and feature importance analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning symbolic turbulence models from indirect observation data is of significant interest as it not only improves the accuracy of posterior prediction but also provides explicit model formulations with good interpretability. However, it typically resorts to gradient-free evolutionary algorithms, which can be relatively inefficient compared to gradient-based approaches, particularly when the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are involved in the training process. In view of this difficulty, we propose a framework that uses neural networks and the associated feature importance analysis to improve the efficiency of symbolic turbulence modeling. In doing so, the gradient-based method can be used to efficiently learn neural network-based representations of Reynolds stress from indirect data, which is further transformed into simplified mathematical expressions with symbolic regression. Moreover, feature importance analysis is introduced to accelerate the convergence of symbolic regression by excluding insignificant input features. The proposed training strategy is tested in the flow in a square duct, where it correctly learns underlying analytic models from indirect velocity data. Further, the method is applied in the flow over the periodic hills, demonstrating that the feature importance analysis can significantly improve the training efficiency and learn symbolic turbulence models with satisfactory generalizability.</description>

      <title>Enhanced oil recovery in reservoirs via diffusion-driven $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding: Experimental insights and material balance modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion significantly influences the $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding process and directly impacts oil recovery efficiency. Traditional water flooding models fail to capture the complex mass transfer mechanisms in $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding. This study examines the diffusion effect in $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding and analyzes the seepage characteristics in low-permeability reservoirs using Berea core experiments. Experimental results show that diffusion is crucial in the interaction between $\text{CO}_{2}$ and crude oil, especially during miscible flooding, where $\text{CO}_{2}$ enhances crude oil flowability and boosts recovery. Additionally, the study proposes a material balance equation for $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding that incorporates the diffusion effect, offering a more accurate description of material changes during the process. Comparing experimental data with numerical simulations confirms that the material balance equation is highly applicable to low-permeability reservoir development, particularly in predicting recovery factors and optimizing $\text{CO}_{2}$ injection parameters.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the evolution of three-dimensional turbulent recirculating flows from sparse sensor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven algorithm is proposed that employs sparse data from velocity and/or scalar sensors to forecast the future evolution of three dimensional turbulent flows. The algorithm combines time-delayed embedding together with Koopman theory and linear optimal estimation theory. It consists of 3 steps; dimensionality reduction (currently POD), construction of a linear dynamical system for current and future POD coefficients and system closure using sparse sensor measurements. In essence, the algorithm establishes a mapping from current sparse data to the future state of the dominant structures of the flow over a specified time window. The method is scalable (i.e.\ applicable to very large systems), physically interpretable, and provides sequential forecasting on a sliding time window of prespecified length. It is applied to the turbulent recirculating flow over a surface-mounted cube (with more than $10^8$ degrees of freedom) and is able to forecast accurately the future evolution of the most dominant structures over a time window at least two orders of magnitude larger that the (estimated) Lyapunov time scale of the flow. Most importantly, increasing the size of the forecasting window only slightly reduces the accuracy of the estimated future states. Extensions of the method to include convolutional neural networks for more efficient dimensionality reduction and moving sensors are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Data-driven pressure field prediction for ships in regular sea states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merchant shipping is responsible for more than 90% of the global trade and has a significant environmental impact, accounting for over 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, fuel-saving measures are becoming increasingly important in reducing the ecological footprint and increasing the fuel efficiency of maritime transport. Routing optimization systems, which require a rapid prediction of ambient-dependent fuel consumption, represent an essential pillar here, e.g. to reduce added resistances due to seaways and/or wind. The paper aims to predict the added resistance due to seaways. In contrast to conventional methods the goal is achieved by surrogate modeling of the entire pressure fields. To this end, an online/offline-procedure is applied to an exemplarily free-floating container vessel. The online approach to be trained consists of two building blocks, namely a convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based order reduction step and a neural network-based (NN) regression step that links the reduced space of the autoencoder with three control parameters that describe the sea state (wave height/steepness, encounter angle and wave length). Training data is obtained from time-averaged values for simulating instantaneous ship motion and pressure fields. During the offline phase, the combined CAE/NN is trained to capture the time-averaged pressure fields for a variety of sea-state conditions. During ship operation (online phase), the surrogate model predicts the three-dimensional pressure fields in response to sea state conditions, projects the pressure fields onto the ship hull, and integrates the corresponding resistances to guide the route. The evaluation of the method shows promising results for the different building blocks and the concept could therefore represent an attractive approach for cost-effective surrogate modeling of complex multiphase flow fields.</description>

      <title>Droplet Outbursts from Onion Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting onions often leads to tear-inducing aerosol release in kitchen, yet the underlying mechanics of droplet generation remain poorly understood. In this work, we combine custom-developed high-speed particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and digital image correlation (DIC) to visualize and quantify droplet ejection during onion cutting. We show that droplet formation occurs via a two-stage process: an initial high-speed ejection driven by internal pressurization of the onion first-layer, followed by slower ligament fragmentation in air. By systematically varying blade sharpness and cutting speed, we find that faster or blunter blades significantly increase both the number and energy of ejected droplets. Strain mapping via DIC reveals that the onion's tough epidermis acts as a barrier to fracture, enabling the underlying mesophyll to undergo significant compression before rupture, thereby increasing both the quantity and velocity of the resulting splashed droplets. Developing a scaling model and a simplified bi-layer model with a spring foundation, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrated how sharpened blades lead to not only fewer but also slower droplets. Numerical calculations accurately explain the onion critical fracture force obtained from independent Instron tests. The work highlights the importance of blade sharpening routines to limiting ejected droplets infected with pathogens in the kitchen, which pack additional outburst energy due to vegetables' outer strong casings.</description>

      <title>Omni-Temporal Theory and Simulation of Hydrodynamic Dispersion using Fourier Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic dispersion determines the extent of solute mixing and apparent diffusive flux in various chemical, geological, and biological systems that possess flow with strong velocity gradients. Though established dispersion theory captures the transient interplay between diffusion, flow, and reaction rates, a long-time approximation is commonly adopted where the characteristic time scale of flow substantially exceeds that of pore-scale diffusion. Here, we introduce a frequency-based theory to model omni-temporal dispersion through porous media that simultaneously captures fast and slow components of dispersion. To create this theory, we formally volume-average the Fourier-transformed pore-scale advection-diffusion equation for solute and obtain up-scaled transport coefficients for a periodic unit cell: a dispersion tensor, an advection suppression vector, and reaction-rate coefficients. These coefficients serve dually as transfer functions that correlate certain output with input quantities in the frequency domain, enabling the prediction of up-scaled temporal dynamics using inverse Fourier transformation. Their utility is demonstrated by deriving analytical expressions for the dispersion coefficient for cases of Poiseuille flow between parallel plates and through circular tubes. This omni-temporal theory produces breakthrough curves for a fast solute pulse between inactive parallel plates that agree with the solute propagation rates predicted by direct numerical simulation (DNS), in contrast with conventional asymptotic theory that overpredicts such by orders of magnitude. Deviations in solute peak magnitude from DNS are shown to arise from solute back-diffusion into the inlet plane as well as entry-region effects that are evidenced by a non-periodic variation of the closure variable b.</description>

      <title>Sweep Angle Effects of Flow Over an Undulated Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow over a seal whisker-inspired undulated cylinder at swept back angles is computationally investigated, comparing the vortex shedding, forces, and wake characteristics to those of an equivalent smooth geometry. Numerous prior studies have demonstrated that undulated cylinders can reduce mean drag and unsteady lift oscillations; however, none have isolated the effects of sweep resulting from whisker positioning in flow. Relevant not only to understanding seal whiskers, such findings are also useful in engineering structural applications to reduce drag and vortex-induced vibration. This investigation performs direct numerical simulation of flow across a rigid, infinite-span, undulated cylinder at sweep angles from 0 to 60{\deg} and at Reynolds numbers of 250 and 500. At zero sweep, the undulated cylinder breaks up coherent two-dimensional vortices, having the effect of reducing drag by 10.4% and root mean square lift by 91.2% compared to a smooth elliptical cylinder. With sweep added, the prominence of spanwise vortex breakup and force suppression is reduced, approximating flow over smooth ellipse geometry as sweep increases. At low sweep angles of 15 and 30 degrees, lift is still suppressed by 75.5% and 50% while drag results in a smaller difference of 7.4 and 1.9% reduction from a smooth ellipse.</description>

      <title>A critical assessment of reinforcement learning methods for microswimmer navigation in complex flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating in a fluid flow while being carried by it, using only information accessible from on-board sensors, is a problem commonly faced by small planktonic organisms. It is also directly relevant to autonomous robots deployed in the oceans. In the last ten years, the fluid mechanics community has widely adopted reinforcement learning, often in the form of its simplest implementations, to address this challenge. But it is unclear how good are the strategies learned by these algorithms. In this paper, we perform a quantitative assessment of reinforcement learning methods applied to navigation in partially observable flows. We first introduce a well-posed problem of directional navigation for which a quasi-optimal policy is known analytically. We then report on the poor performance and robustness of commonly used algorithms (Q-Learning, Advantage Actor Critic) in flows regularly encountered in the literature: Taylor-Green vortices, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, and two-dimensional turbulence. We show that they are vastly surpassed by PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), a more advanced algorithm that has established dominance across a wide range of benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community. In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the theoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust manner. Reaching this result required the use of several additional techniques, such as vectorized environments and generalized advantage estimation, as well as hyperparameter optimization. This study demonstrates the importance of algorithm selection, implementation details, and fine-tuning for discovering truly smart autonomous navigation strategies in complex flows.</description>

      <title>Self-reorganization and Information Transfer in Massive Schools of Fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.</description>

      <title>Joint Reduced Model for the Laminar and Chaotic Attractors in Plane Couette Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of spectral submanifolds (SSMs) to develop a low-dimensional reduced-order model for plane Couette flow in the permanently chaotic regime studied by Kreilos &amp; Eckhardt (2012). Our three-dimensional model is obtained by restricting the dynamics to the slowest mixed-mode SSM of the edge state. We show that this results in a nonlinear model that accurately reconstructs individual trajectories, representing the entire chaotic attractor and the laminar dynamics simultaneously. In addition, we derive a two-dimensional Poincar\'e map that enables the rapid computation of the periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor.</description>
