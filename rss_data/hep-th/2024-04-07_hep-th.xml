      <title>Structure and Complexity of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators capture the spatial fluctuations imprinted during the earliest episodes of the universe. While they are generally very non-trivial functions of the kinematic variables, they are known to arise as solutions to special sets of differential equations. In this work we use this fact to uncover the underlying tame structure for such correlators and argue that they admit a well-defined notion of complexity. In particular, building upon the recently proposed kinematic flow algorithm, we show that tree-level cosmological correlators of a generic scalar field theory in an FLRW spacetime belong to the class of Pfaffian functions. Since Pfaffian functions admit a notion of complexity, we can give explicit bounds on the topological and computational complexity of cosmological correlators. We conclude with some speculative comments on the general tame structures capturing all cosmological correlators and the connection between complexity and the emergence of time.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Soft Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in supersymmetric theories, knowing the soft theorem for a single particle in a supermultiplet allows one to immediately determine soft theorems for the remainder of the supermultiplet. While soft theorems in supersymmetric theories have a rich history, they have only been chronicled for specific examples due to the fact that they are usually derived with technical Feynman diagrammatics or amplitudes methods. By contrast, we show that one can compute soft theorems non-perturbatively for entire supermultiplets in one line of algebra. This formalism is directly applicable to the most general supersymmetric theory: one with an arbitrary matter content, number of supercharges, and spacetime dimension. We give many explicit examples illustrating the scope and dexterity of this framework.</description>

      <title>RG flows in de Sitter: c-functions and sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the renormalization group flow of unitary Quantum Field Theories on two-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and on the Euclidean two-sphere of radius $R$. We prove the existence of two functions $c_1(R)$ and $c_2(R)$ which interpolate between the central charges of the UV and of the IR fixed points of the flow when tuning the radius $R$ while keeping the mass scales of the theory fixed. $c_1(R)$ is constructed from certain components of the two-point function of the stress tensor evaluated at antipodal separation. $c_2(R)$ is the spectral weight of the stress tensor over the $\Delta=2$ discrete series. This last fact implies that the stress tensor of any unitary QFT in $S^2$/dS$_2$ must interpolate between the vacuum and states in the $\Delta=2$ discrete series irrep. We verify that the c-functions are monotonic for intermediate radii in the free massive boson and free massive fermion theories, but we lack a general proof of said monotonicity. We derive a variety of sum rules which relate the central charges and the c-functions to integrals of the two-point function of the trace of the stress tensor and to integrals of its spectral densities. The positivity of these formulas implies $c^{\text{UV}}\geq c^{\text{IR}}$. In the infinite radius limit the sum rules reduce to the well known formulas in flat space. Throughout the paper, we prove some general properties of the spectral decomposition of the stress tensor in $S^{d+1}$/dS$_{d+1}$.</description>

      <title>Finite cut-off JT and Liouville quantum gravities on the disk at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the path integral formalism, we compute the disk partition functions of two dimensional Liouville and JT quantum gravity theories coupled to a matter CFT of central charge $c$, with cosmological constant $\Lambda$, in the limit $c\rightarrow -\infty$, $|\Lambda|\rightarrow\infty$, for fixed $\Lambda/c$ and fixed and finite disk boundary length $\ell$, to leading and first subleading order in the $1/|c|$ expansion. In the case of Liouville theory, we find perfect agreement with the asymptotic expansion of the known exact DOZZ partition function. In the case of JT gravity, we obtain the first explicit results for the partition functions at finite cut-off, in the three versions (negative, zero and positive curvature) of the model. Our findings are in agreement with predictions from the recent proposal for a microscopic definition of JT gravity, including the $c\rightarrow -\infty$ expansion of the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary. We also provide evidence for the emergence of an effective Schwarzian description at length scales much greater than the curvature length scale.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole from noncommutative charged scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of noncommutative (NC) deformation of gauge field theory by twist, we first rederive the NC scalar and gauge field model from our previous papers and then generalize it to the second order in the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map. It turns out that SW expansion is finite and that it ceases at the second order in the deformation parameter, ultimately giving rise to the equation of motion for the scalar field that is nonperturbative and exact at the same order. As a further step, we show that the effective metric put forth and constructed in our previous work satisfies the equations of Einstein-Maxwell gravity, but only within the first order of deformation and when the gauge field is fixed by the Coulomb potential of the charged black hole. Thus obtained NC deformation of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om (RN) metric appears to have an additional off-diagonal element which scales linearly with a deformation parameter. We analyze various properties of this metric.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents and Phase Transition of Hayward AdS Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between the phase transition and Lyapunov exponents for 4D Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. We consider the motion of massless and massive particles around an unstable circular orbit of the Hayward AdS black hole in the equatorial plane and calculate the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. The phase transition is found to be well described by the multivaled Lyapunov exponents. It is also found that different phases of Hayward AdS black hole coincide with different branches of the Lyapunov exponents. We also study the discontinuous change in the Lyapunov exponents and find that it can serve as an order parameter near the critical point. The critical exponent of change in Lyapunov exponent near the critical point is found to be $1/2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parisi-Sourlas approach to supersymmetry implies that, in spacetime dimensions greater than 1, there is a constraint on the minimal number of flavors, in order for a field theory to define a closed system. In particular, this number is greater than 1. This does not preclude that supersymmetry can be broken, however, and the known ways of breaking supersymmetry can be taken into account from this point of view, by using the so-called Nicolai map. This procedure is well-defined for abelian gauge theories and corresponds to the construction of the so-called trivializing maps for non-abelian gauge theories, that is, still, work in progress.</description>

      <title>Explorations in Precision Holography and Higher-derivative Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores topics related to the study of quantum gravity, with a focus on precision holography and higher-derivative supergravity. First, we study subleading corrections to the free energy of a particular 3D N=3 Chern-Simons-matter theory found by Gaiotto and Tomasiello, which is given by a matrix model after supersymmetric localization. This theory is dual to massive IIA supergravity on AdS4, and consequently, the structure of subleading corrections to the field theory naturally elucidates the higher-derivative corrections to the gravity dual. We extract the first order of corrections to the free energy using resolvent methods, and our results imply that particular terms in the supergravity action should vanish on-shell. Next, we consider the unreasonable effectiveness of five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity. There are three independent supersymmetric four-derivative terms that one can add to the action; nevertheless, after going on-shell (or, equivalently, after a field redefinition that pushes the off-shell discrepancies to six-derivative order), there is a unique supersymmetric invariant. Third, we consider the effect of higher-derivative corrections in holographic renormalization group flows across dimensions. In particular, we construct a local holographic c-function out of metric functions and show its monotonicity via the Null Energy Condition. We also construct a c-function from the entanglement entropy for flows with a CFT2 IR fixed point, and we show that such flows are monotonic. Finally, we consider consistent truncations of four-derivative heterotic supergravity. In particular, we show that reducing both on a torus $T^n$ or on $S^3$ and truncating the vector multiplets is indeed a consistent truncation at the four-derivative level. Moreover, we find examples of two-derivative consistent truncations which fail to extend to four-derivative ones.</description>

      <title>The Ooguri-Vafa space as a moduli space of framed wild harmonic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00261v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ooguri-Vafa space is a 4-dimensional incomplete hyperk\"{a}hler manifold, defined on the total space of a singular torus fibration with one singular nodal fiber. It has been proposed that the Ooguri-Vafa hyperk\"ahler metric should be part of the local model of the hyperk\"{a}hler metric of the Hitchin moduli spaces, near the most generic kind of singular locus of the Hitchin fibration. In order to relate the Ooguri-Vafa space with the Hitchin moduli spaces, we show that the Ooguri-Vafa space can be interpreted as a set of rank 2, framed wild harmonic bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^1$, with one irregular singularity. Along the way we show that a certain twistor family of holomorphic Darboux coordinates, which describes the hyperk\"{a}hler geometry of the Ooguri-Vafa space, has an interpretation in terms of Stokes data associated to our framed wild harmonic bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of the charged kaon in symmetric nuclear matter using a Bethe-Salpeter amplitude to model the quark-anti-quark bound state, which is well constrained by previous studies of its vacuum properties. The electromagnetic form factor, charge radius, decay constant and the light-front valence component probability are investigated in symmetric nuclear matter. In order to describe the constituent up and anti-strange quarks in nuclear matter, we adopt the ``quark-meson coupling (QMC) model", which has been widely applied to various hadronic and nuclear phenomena in the nuclear medium.</description>

      <title>Re-assessing special aspects of Dirac fermions in presence of Lorentz-symmetry violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on additional inspections concerning the fermionic sector of the Standard Model Extension (SME). In this context, our main effort in this contribution is to investigate effects of Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) on the Klein Paradox, the Zitterbewegung and its phenomenology in connection to Condensed Matter Physics, Atomic Physics, and Astrophysics. Finally, we discuss a particular realization of LSV in the Dirac equation, considering an asymmetry between space and time due to a scale factor present in the linear momentum of the fermion, but which does not touch its time derivative. We go further and extend the implications of this asymmetry in the situation the scale factor becomes space-time dependent to compute its influence on the kinematics of the Compton effect with the extended dispersion relation for the fermion that scatters the photon.</description>

      <title>Strong Cosmic Censorship in Kerr-Newman-de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Christodoulou's formulation of Strong Cosmic Censorship (SCC) holds true for Kerr-de Sitter black holes. On the other hand, Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black holes violate SCC. We do a detailed scan of the parameter space of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes between these two limiting families, to identify the boundary that marks the transition between solutions that respect and violate SCC. We focus our attention on linear scalar field perturbations. SCC is violated inside a (roughly) `spherical' shell of the parameter space of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter, centred at the corner that describes arbitrarily small extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solutions. Outside of this region, including the Kerr-de Sitter limit, we identify perturbation modes that decay slow enough to enforce SCC. Additionally, we do a necessary study of the quasinormal mode spectra of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter in some detail. As established in the literature, in the Kerr-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter limits, we find three families of modes: de Sitter, photon sphere and near-horizon modes. These interact non-trivially away from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter limit and display eigenvalue repulsions like in Kerr-Newman black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement.
  We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</description>

      <title>Super-extremal black holes in the quasitopological electromagnetic field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that a simple generalization of electromagnetism, referred to as quasitopological electromagnetic field theory, is characterized by the presence of dyonic black-hole solutions of the Einstein field equations that, in certain parameter regions, are characterized by four horizons. In the present compact paper we reveal the existence, in this non-linear electrodynamic field theory, of super-extremal black-hole spacetimes that are characterized by the four degenerate functional relations $[g_{00}(r)]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=[dg_{00}(r)/dr]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=[d^2g_{00}(r)/dr^2]_ {r=r_{\text{H}}}=[d^3g_{00}(r)/dr^3]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=0$, where $g_{00}(r)$ is the $tt$-component of the curved line element and $r_{\text{H}}$ is the black-hole horizon radius. In particular, using analytical techniques we prove that the quartically degenerate super-extremal black holes are characterized by the universal (parameter-{\it independent}) dimensionless compactness parameter $M/r_{\text{H}}={2\over3}(2\gamma+1)$, where $\gamma\equiv{_2F_1}(1/4,1;5/4;-3)$.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves in non-singular matter bouncing cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel model-independent generic mechanism for primordial black hole formation within the context of non-singular matter bouncing cosmology. In particular, considering a short duration transition from the matter contracting phase to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, we find naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales which can collapse and form primordial black holes. Interestingly, the primordial black hole masses that we find can lie within the observationally unconstrained asteroid-mass window, potentially explaining the totality of dark matter. Remarkably, the enhanced curvature perturbations, collapsing to primordial black holes, can induce as well a stochastic gravitational-wave background, being potentially detectable by future experiments, in particular by SKA, PTAs, LISA and ET, hence serving as a new portal to probe the potential bouncing nature of the initial conditions prevailing in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Investigating two-dimensional adjoint QCD on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our investigations of SU($N$) adjoint QCD in two dimensions with one Majorana fermion on the lattice. We determine the relevant parameter range for the simulations with Wilson fermions and present results for Polyakov loop, chiral condensate, and string tension. In the theory with massive fermions, all observables we checked show qualitative agreement between numerical lattice data and theory, while the massless limit is more subtle since chiral and non-invertible symmetry of the continuum theory are explicitly broken by lattice regularization. In thermal compactification, we observe $N$ perturbative vacua for the holonomy potential at high-$T$ with instanton events connecting them, and a unique vacuum at low-$T$. At finite-$N$, this is a cross-over and it turns to a phase transition at large-$N$ thermodynamic limit. In circle compactification with periodic boundary conditions, we observe a unique center-symmetric minimum at any radius. In continuum, the instantons in the thermal case carry zero modes (for even $N$) and indeed, in the lattice simulations, we observe that chiral condensate is dominated by instanton centers, where zero modes are localized. We present lattice results on the issue of confinement vs. screening in the theory and comment on the roles of chiral symmetry and non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild argued that measurements of timelike and null geodesics yield projective and Weyl connections, respectively, with compatibility giving an integrable Weyl geometry. We find greater freedom for both connections, including either a 1-parameter class of projective connections, or a conformal connection for timelike curves, and conformal symmetry for null curves. Examining the effect of every member of both the projective class and the conformal transformations on the curvature, torsion, nonmetricity, and metric, we find the changes from the original geometry. Forming invariant connections we compute both the projectively and conformally invariant forms of the curvature, torsion, and nometricity, showing that the projective and conformal tensors depend on the same gauge vector. We prove that the conditions for projective and conformal Ricci flatness imply each other and either reduces the geometry to the original form. The different transformations depend on the same monotonic, twice differentiable function on a region of spacetime. Existence of such a function requires a region foliated by order isomorphic, totally ordered, twice differentiable timelike curves in a necessarily Lorentzian geometry. To find a geometry consistent with the allowed symmetry, we develop the real, linear, 6-dim representation of the conformal connection. Taking the simplest form of the spacetime action using this connection, we show that reductions of the system lead us back to an integrable Weyl geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short paper we make use of the recent covariant extension of the generalised uncertainty principle to study the corrections to the vacuum energy of the simplest scalar quantum field theory. We then calculate the modifications to the Casimir effect that such a correction to the vacuum energy would bring about. We emphasise that these corrections are indeed physical.</description>

      <title>A pseudo-spectral approach to constructing rotating boson star spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel numerical solver for the systems of coupled non-linear elliptical differential equations. The solver partitions the computational domain into a set of rectangular pseudo-spectral collocation subdomains and is especially well-suited for working with stiff solutions such as almost shell-like solitonic boson stars. The method can be used in any number of dimensions although is practical for one- to three-dimensional problems. We apply the method to rotating and spherically symmetric solitonic boson stars and demonstrate that it displays exponential convergence. In the spherical symmetric case we explore families of almost shell-like solitonic boson stars and get the results that conform with the well-known analytic approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitonic boson stars (SBS) are compact shell-like objects with an inside having a nearly constant value of scalar field bounded by a thin shell where the scalar field rapidly changes. While the spherically symmetric SBS can be described by an analytical approximation that works well in the thin-shell case, no such approximation exists for rotating SBS and the investigation of such stars poses a numerical challenge. We numerically investigate rotating SBS in case if the relative thickness of the shell is small. We compute Gerosh-Hansen multipole moments to study the structure of SBS spacetime in the outside region and the closeness of SBS to the rotating black hole metric.</description>

      <title>Graviton mass due to dark energy as a superconducting medium: theoretical and phenomenological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations can be interpreted as a stress tensor for dark energy. This stress tensor is formally analogous to an elastic constitutive equation in continuum mechanics. As a result, the cosmological constant leads to a "shear modulus" and "bulk modulus" affecting all gravitational fields in the universe. The form of the constitutive equation is also analogous to the London constitutive equation for a superconductor. Treating dark energy as a type of superconducting medium for gravitational waves leads to a Yukawa-like gravitational potential and a massive graviton within standard General Relativity. We discuss a number of resulting phenomenological aspects such as a screening length scale that can also be used to describe the effects generally attributed to dark matter. In addition, we find a gravitational wave plasma frequency, index of refraction, and impedance. The expansion of the universe is interpreted as a Meissner-like effect as dark energy causes an outward "expulsion" of space-time similar to a superconductor expelling a magnetic field. The fundamental cause of these effects is interpreted as a type of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field. There is an associated chemical potential, critical temperature, and an Unruh-Hawking effect associated with the formulation.</description>

      <title>Vacuum correlations of the stress-energy-momentum tensor with constituent quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two point correlation function of the stress-energy-momentum tensor describes the propagation of a space-time "micro-earthquake" in the vacuum. In the framework of the path integral formulation of field theory in curved space-time, we derive the Ward-Takashi identity for two-point Green's function of the stress-energy-momentum tensor for a general case of a non-conformal theory. The identity constrains the longitudinal part of the correlator, with the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy-momentum, non-zero in a non-conformal theory. The obtained formula is demonstrated on the free massive Dirac fermion theory, treated at the one-loop level. This example befits a class of phenomenological chiral quarks models which have been used successfully in numerous applications in the soft non-perturbative regime of strong interactions. We discuss the constraints following from the Ward-Takahashi identity for the correlation functions in these models. We also show how the temporal representation of the two-point correlators, which is an object amenable to lattice QCD, displays an expected exponential fall-off.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as possible probes for quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <title>Quantum radiation reaction: Analytical approximations and obtaining the spectrum from moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive analytical $\chi\ll1$ approximations for spin-dependent quantum radiation reaction for locally constant and locally monochromatic fields. We show how to factor out fast spin oscillations and obtain the degree of polarization in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field from the Frobenius norm of the Mueller matrix. We show that spin effects lead to a transseries in $\chi$, with powers $\chi^k$, logarithms $(\ln\chi)^k$ and oscillating terms, $\cos(\dots/\chi)$ and $\sin(\dots/\chi)$. In our approach we can obtain each moment, $\langle(kP)^m\rangle$, of the lightfront longitudinal momentum independently of the other moments and without considering the spectrum. We show how to obtain a low-energy expansion of the spectrum from the moments by treating $m$ as a continuous, complex parameter and performing an inverse Mellin transform. We also show how to obtain the spectrum, without making a low-energy approximation, from a handful of moments using the principle of maximum entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11933v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Form factors in the sinh-Gordon model are studied semiclassically for small values of the parameter $b\sim\hbar^{1/2}$ in the background of a radial classical solution, which describes a heavy exponential operator placed at the origin. For this purpose we use a generalization of the radial quantization scheme, well known for a massless boson field. We introduce and study new special functions which generalize the Bessel functions and have a nice interpretation in the Tracy-Widom theory of the Fredholm determinant solutions of the classical sinh-Gordon model. Form factors of the exponential operators in the leading order are completely determined by the classical solutions, while form factors of the descendant operators contain quantum corrections even in this approximation. The construction of descendant operators in two chiralities requires renormalizations similar to those encountered in the conformal perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new formulation of manifestly Lorentz-covariant spinor wave-packet basis. The conventional definition of the spinor wave packet is problematic in the sense that it suffers from mixing with other wave packets under Lorentz transformations. Our formulation evades this difficulty of mixing. This wave packet forms a complete set that can expand a free spinor field in a Lorentz covariant manner. In addition, we present a Lorentz-invariant expression of zero-point energy.</description>

Abstract: We propose to solve the dark energy and the coincidence problems by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that these observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector and coincidence problem. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a FLRW universe dominated by the energy density of moduli close to asymptotic regions of moduli space. Due to the structure of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA kinetic term, a saxion and an axion residing in the same chiral multiplet are (universally) coupled even if the latter is a flat direction of the potential, resulting in non-trivial dynamics. We generalise known results in the literature to the case of multiple moduli, showing the existence of various ``tracker" attractor solutions where the relative energy densities of many components (axions included) stay in a fixed ratio throughout the evolution. We conclude with some phenomenological applications, relevant for both the early and late universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the logarithmic corrections to various CFT partition functions in the context of the AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ correspondence for theories arising on the worldvolume of M2-branes. We utilize four-dimensional gauged supergravity and heat kernel methods and present general expressions for the logarithmic corrections to the gravitational on-shell action and black hole entropy for a number of different supergravity backgrounds. We outline several subtle features of these calculations and contrast them with a similar analysis of logarithmic corrections performed directly in the eleven-dimensional uplift of a given four-dimensional supergravity background. We find results consistent with AdS/CFT provided that the infinite sum over KK modes on the internal space is regularized in a specific manner. This analysis leads to an explicit expression for the logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of large Kerr-Newmann and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in AdS$_4$. Our results also have important implications for effective field theory coupled to gravity in AdS$_4$ and for the existence of scale-separated AdS$_4$ vacua in string theory, which come in the form of new constraints on the field content and mass spectrum of matter fields.</description>

Abstract: We continue our analysis of bad theories, focusing on quiver theories with bad unitary and special unitary gauge groups in three dimensions. By extending the dualization algorithm we prove that the partition function of bad linear quivers can be written as a distribution, given by a sum of terms involving a product of delta functions times the partition function of a good quiver theory. We describe in detail the good quiver theories appearing in the partition function of the bad theory and discuss the brane interpretation of our result. We also discuss in detail the lift of these theories to 4d quivers with symplectic gauge groups, in which our results can be recovered by studying the Higgsing triggered by the expectation value for certain chiral operators. The paper is accompanied by a Mathematica file which implements the algorithm for an arbitrary unitary bad linear quiver.</description>

      <title>On harvesting physical predictions from asymptotically safe quantum field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>

Abstract: It was recently discovered by Arkani-Hamed et al that the colour-ordered scattering amplitudes of Tr$(\Phi^3)$, the NLSM and scaffolded YM vanish at specific loci. We build on this observation and demonstrate that, beyond colour ordering, scattering amplitudes can display multiple instances of these hidden zeros. A first example are the flavour-ordered amplitudes of scaffolded General Relativity, corresponding to graviton exchange. The other two cases are multi-flavour DBI and the special Galileon. These are the natural generalisations of the NLSM with multiple instances of Adler's zero. The zero loci naturally define factorisation limits; in all three cases these include a metric-coupled cubic scalar theory. We comment on the general picture of hidden zeros and the relation to the double copy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the insertion of a Gukov-Witten surface defect in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM corresponding to a probe D3-brane in the holographic dual setup. The defect gives rise to a $4d$-$2d$ coupled system encoding the entropy of the dual perturbed black hole, which can be extracted from the corresponding Superconformal Index. Elaborating on previous studies, we refine the results using both a saddle-point and a Bethe-Ansatz approach. The consistency of our computation is corroborated by the complete agreement between the two results in the appropriate regime of fugacities. Eventually, the sub-leading structure, emerging from our analysis, provides a suggestive EFT interpretation for the addition of the defect to the $4d$ system, mirroring the behavior of the probe D3-brane in the gravity dual.</description>

      <title>The Tale of Three Scales: the Planck, the Species, and the Black Hole Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity (QG) has a natural cutoff given by the Planck scale $M_{\rm pl}$. However, it is known that the EFT of gravity can break down at a lower scale, the species scale $\Lambda_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, if there are light species of particles. Here we point out that there is a third scale $\Lambda_{\rm BH}\lesssim \Lambda_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, which marks the inverse length (or the temperature) of the smallest black hole where the EFT gives a correct description of its entropy and free energy. This latter scale is hard to detect from the viewpoint of EFT as it represents a phase transition to a state with lower free energy. We illustrate this using examples drawn from consistent QG landscape. In particular $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ gets related to Gregory--Laflamme transition in the decompactification limits of quantum gravity and to the Horowitz--Polchinski solution in the light perturbative string limits. We propose the existence of $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ marking the temperature at which neutral black holes undergo a phase transition, as a new Swampland condition for all consistent quantum theories of gravity. In the asymptotic regimes of field space $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ is close to the mass scale of the lightest tower but deviates from it as we move inwards in the moduli space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Unruh-DeWitt particle detector model has found success in demonstrating quantum information channels with non-zero channel capacity between qubits and quantum fields. These detector models provide the necessary framework for experimentally realizable Unruh-DeWitt Quantum Computers with near-perfect channel capacity. We propose spin qubits with gate-controlled coupling to Luttinger liquids as a laboratory setting for Unruh-DeWitt detectors and general design constraints that underpin their feasibility in this and other settings. We also present several experimental scenarios including graphene ribbons, edges states in the quantum spin Hall phase of HgTe quantum wells, and the recently discovered quantum anomalous Hall phase in transition metal dichalcogenides. Theoretically, through bosonization, we show that Unruh-DeWitt detectors can carry out Quantum Computations and when they can make perfect quantum communication channels between qubits via the Luttinger liquid. Our results point the way toward an all-to-all connected solid state quantum computer and the experimental study of quantum information in quantum fields via condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>The Underlying Scaling Laws and Universal Statistical Structure of Complex Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal traits which emerge both in real-world complex datasets, as well as in artificially generated ones. Our approach is to analogize data to a physical system and employ tools from statistical physics and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to reveal their underlying structure. We focus on the feature-feature covariance matrix, analyzing both its local and global eigenvalue statistics. Our main observations are: (i) The power-law scalings that the bulk of its eigenvalues exhibit are vastly different for uncorrelated normally distributed data compared to real-world data, (ii) this scaling behavior can be completely modeled by generating Gaussian data with long range correlations, (iii) both generated and real-world datasets lie in the same universality class from the RMT perspective, as chaotic rather than integrable systems, (iv) the expected RMT statistical behavior already manifests for empirical covariance matrices at dataset sizes significantly smaller than those conventionally used for real-world training, and can be related to the number of samples required to approximate the population power-law scaling behavior, (v) the Shannon entropy is correlated with local RMT structure and eigenvalues scaling, is substantially smaller in strongly correlated datasets compared to uncorrelated ones, and requires fewer samples to reach the distribution entropy. These findings show that with sufficient sample size, the Gram matrix of natural image datasets can be well approximated by a Wishart random matrix with a simple covariance structure, opening the door to rigorous studies of neural network dynamics and generalization which rely on the data Gram matrix.</description>

      <title>Simplified algorithm for the Worldvolume HMC and the Generalized-thimble HMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo method (WV-HMC method) [arXiv:2012.08468] is a reliable and versatile algorithm towards solving the sign problem. Similarly to the tempered Lefschetz thimble method, this method removes the ergodicity problem inherent in algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In addition to this advantage, the WV-HMC method significantly reduces the computational cost because one needs not compute the Jacobian of deformation in generating configurations. A crucial step in this method is the RATTLE algorithm, where the Newton method is used at each molecular dynamics step to project a transported configuration onto a submanifold (worldvolume) in the complex space. In this paper, we simplify the RATTLE algorithm by employing a simplified Newton method (the fixed-point method) along with iterative solvers for orthogonal decompositions of vectors, and show that this algorithm further reduces the computational cost. We also apply this algorithm to the HMC algorithm for the generalized thimble method (GT-HMC method). We perform a numerical test for the convergence of the simplified RATTLE algorithm, and show that the convergence depends on the system size only weakly. The application of this simplified algorithm to various models will be reported in subsequent papers.</description>

      <title>Lattice investigations of the chimera baryon spectrum in the Sp(4) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the results of lattice numerical studies of the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to fermions (hyperquarks) transforming in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations of the gauge group. This strongly-coupled theory is the minimal candidate for the ultraviolet completion of composite Higgs models that facilitate the mechanism of partial compositeness for generating the top-quark mass. We measure the spectrum of the low-lying, half-integer spin, bound states composed of two fundamental and one antisymmetric hyperquarks, dubbed chimera baryons, in the quenched approximation. In this first systematic, non-perturbative study, we focus on the three lightest parity-even chimera-baryon states, in analogy with QCD, denoted as $\Lambda_{\rm CB}$, $\Sigma_{\rm CB}$ (both with spin 1/2), and $\Sigma_{\rm CB}^\ast$(with spin 3/2). The spin-1/2 such states are candidates of the top partners. The extrapolation of our results to the continuum and massless-hyperquark limit is performed using formulae inspired by QCD heavy-baryon Wilson chiral perturbation theory. Within the range of hyperquark masses in our simulations, we find that $\Sigma_{\mathrm{CB}}$ is not heavier than $\Lambda_{\mathrm{CB}}$.</description>

      <title>Lattice realization of the axial $U(1)$ noninvertible symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01331v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory with compact $U(1)$ variables, we construct the symmetry operator, i.e.\ the topological defect, for the axial $U(1)$ noninvertible symmetry. This requires a lattice formulation of chiral gauge theory with an anomalous matter content and we employ the lattice formulation on the basis of the Ginsparg--Wilson relation. The invariance of the symmetry operator under the gauge transformation of the gauge field on the defect is realized, imitating the prescription by Karasik in continuum theory, by integrating the lattice Chern--Simons term on the defect over \emph{smooth\/} lattice gauge transformations. The projection operator for allowed magnetic fluxes on the defect then emerges with lattice regularization. The resulting symmetry operator is manifestly invariant under lattice gauge transformations. In an appendix, we give another way of constructing the symmetry operator on the basis of a 3D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological quantum field theory, the level-$N$ BF theory on the lattice.</description>

      <title>A covariant tapestry of linear GUP, metric-affine gravity, their Poincar\'e algebra and entropy bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the potential connection between metric-affine gravity and linear Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) in the phase space, we develop a covariant form of linear GUP and an associated modified Poincar\'e algebra, which exhibits distinctive behavior, nearing nullity at the minimal length scale proposed by linear GUP. We use 3-torus geometry to visually represent linear GUP within a covariant framework. The 3-torus area provides an exact geometric representation of Bekenstein's universal bound. We depart from Bousso's approach, which adapts Bekenstein's bound by substituting the Schwarzschild radius ($r_s$) with the radius ($R$) of the smallest sphere enclosing the physical system, thereby basing the covariant entropy bound on the sphere's area. Instead, our revised covariant entropy bound is described by the area of a 3-torus, determined by both the inner radius $r_s$ and outer radius $R$ where $r_s\leq R $ due to gravitational stability. This approach results in a more precise geometric representation of Bekenstein's bound, notably for larger systems where Bousso's bound is typically much larger than Bekensetin's universal bound. Furthermore, we derive an equation that turns the standard uncertainty inequality into an equation when considering the contribution of the 3-torus covariant entropy bound, suggesting a new avenue of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Wormholes inside stars and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct models of two exotic objects: (i) a wormhole whose throat is hidden by a stellar object like a neutron star; and (ii) a wormhole inside a black hole. We work within Einstein's gravity coupled to two scalar fields with a specific choice of the scalar field Lagrangian. In general, the model contains ghosts, but they are eliminated using the constraints given by the Lagrange multiplier fields. The constraints are a generalization of the mimetic constraint, where non-dynamical dark matter effectively appears. As a result, in our model, instead of the non-dynamical dark matter, non-dynamical exotic matter like a phantom effectively arises. For the mixed wormhole-plus-star system, we find the corresponding mass-radius relations and show that it is possible to get characteristics comparable to those of ordinary neutron stars. For the wormhole inside the black hole, we find an extremal limit where the radius of the throat coincides with the radius of the event horizon and demonstrate that the Hawking temperature vanishes in this limit.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</description>

      <title>On Mirror Symmetry and Irrationality of Zeta Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental object of study in mirror symmetry of $n$-dimensional Fano varieties is the A-side connection on small quantum cohomology. When the Picard rank is 1, the Borel transform relates the quantum differential operator of the Fano to the Picard-Fuchs operator of the mirror to the associated pencil of anticanonical Calabi-Yau $(n-1)$-folds on the Fano variety. Expanding on related work by W. Yang on the Beukers-Peters pencil of K3 surfaces associated with Ap\'ery's proof for the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$, for such operators we define holomorphic prepotentials, virtual Yukawa couplings, and virtual instanton numbers, analogous to the usual ingredients of Calabi-Yau mirror symmetry. We prove that when the underlying Calabi-Yau operator is modular, the virtual Yukawa coupling is a modular form of weight-$(n+1)$, with the holomorphic prepotential as an Eichler integral. We then analyze the quantum differential operators for modular pencils of K3 surfaces arising as Dolgachev-Nikulin-Pinkham mirrors for the anticanonical linear systems for the 17 deformation classes of Fano threefolds of Picard rank-1 classified by Iskovskikh from the perspective of Golyshev &amp; Zagier's proof of the Gamma conjecture for such Fanos, the natural setting of Yang's work. Here, the virtual instanton numbers are proven to be periodic integers with period equal to the level of the modular subgroup. Finally, we conjecture that the geometric nature of these virtual instanton numbers can be understood in terms of relative genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of the associated log Calabi-Yau pair from the Fano threefold and anticanonical K3.</description>
