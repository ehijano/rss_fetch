      <title>Quantum Entanglement and Chocolates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two statistical ensembles of chocolates are constructed to mimic two quantum entangled states, the spin singlet state and the GHZ state. Despite great efforts to achieve the closest possible resemblance in terms of probability distribution and correlation, subtle differences remain. The differences reveal and illustrate a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes quantum entanglement from classical correlation.</description>

      <title>Magic of the Heisenberg Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic quantifies the non-Clifford operations required for preparing a state on quantum processors and sets bounds on the classical computational complexity of simulating quantum dynamics. We study a magic resource theory for operators, which is dual to that describing states. We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions, while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower-bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. It is operationally well-defined as quantifying how well one can approximate an operator with one that has only few Pauli strings; analogous to the relation between entanglement entropy and tensor-network truncation. An immediate advantage is that the operator stabilizer entropies exhibit inherent locality through a Lieb-Robinson bound, making them particularly suited for studying local dynamic magic generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that random evolution or circuits typically have approximately maximal magic in the Heisenberg picture for all R\'enyi indices, and evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we compute the operator stabilizer entropy evolution for an interacting integrable XXZ circuit. In this case, magic quickly saturates to a constant; a distinct Heisenberg picture phenomena and suggestive of a connection to integrability. We argue that this efficiently computable operator magic monotone reveals structural properties of many-body magic generation, and can inspire novel Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</description>

      <title>Squeezed Thermal Reservoir Engineering via Linear Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering aims to transform typically detrimental dissipations into advantageous resources. We present a versatile method for creating a squeezed thermal reservoir for quantum systems. By coupling the system to a lossy mode within a normal thermal environment, we can emulate the effect of a squeezed reservoir characterized by reduced fluctuations in one quadrature. We demonstrate this approach through two illustrative cases: one for two-level systems, such as qubits or atoms, and another for bosonic modes, like photons or phonons. This method leverages constant linear interactions within a normal thermal environment, ensuring experimental feasibility without requiring squeezed light inputs or time-dependent modulations. This technique holds promise for various applications, including the enhancement of dissipative squeezing, stabilization of entanglement, advancement of quantum simulations, exploration of quantum thermodynamics and phase transitions, and improvement of precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Shortest Vector Problems with Folded Spectrum Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing has been recently studied to solve the shortest vector problem (SVP), where the norm of a lattice point vector is mapped to the problem Hamiltonian with the qudit encoding, Hamming-weight encoding, or binary encoding, and the problem to find the shortest vector is mapped to a problem to find a non-trivial first excited state. We here propose an alternative encoding and alternative quantum algorithm to solve the SVP: the one-hot encoding and the quantum imaginary-time algorithm with the folded spectrum (FS) method. We demonstrate that our approach is applicable to find the shortest vector with a variational quantum algorithm. The application of the FS method to the quantum annealing and simulated annealing is also discussed to solve the SVP. Our study shows wide potential applicability of the SVP in quantum computing frameworks.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, correlation functions, and entanglement of general quantum Motzkin spin-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motzkin spin-chains, which include 'colorless' (integer spin $s=1$) and 'colorful' ($s \geq 2$) variants, are one-dimensional (1D) local integer spin models notable for their lack of a conformal field theory (CFT) description of their low-energy physics, despite being gapless. The colorful variants are particularly unusual, as they exhibit power-law violation of the area-law of entanglement entropy (as $\sqrt{n}$ in system size $n$), rather than a logarithmic violation as seen in a CFT. In this work, we analytically discover several unique properties of these models, potentially suggesting a new universality class for their low-energy physics. We identify a complex structure of symmetries and unexpected scaling behavior in spin-spin correlations, which deviate from known 1D universality classes. Specifically, the $s=1$ chain exhibits $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking and ferromagnetic order. Meanwhile, the $s \geq 2$ chains do not appear to spontaneously break any symmetries, but display quasi-long-range algebraic order with power-law decaying correlations, inconsistent with standard Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical exponents. We also derive exact asymptotic scaling expressions for entanglement measures in both colorless and colorful chains, generalizing previous results of Movassagh [J. Math Phys. (2017)], while providing benchmarks for potential quantum simulation experiments. The combination of hardness of classically simulating such systems along with the analytical tractability of their ground state properties position Motzkin spin chains as intriguing candidates for exploring quantum computational advantage in simulating many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Modular variable laser cooling for efficient entropy extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method for laser cooling an oscillator based on sequences of spin-state-dependent displacements followed by spin repumping. For a thermal state with mean occupation $\bar{n}\gg 1$ the method attains a reduction to 0.632 of the initial thermal oscillator occupation for two repumps of the two-level spin state. This is within a factor of 2.53 of the optimum that might be expected due to the reduction of the oscillator entropy by $2 \ln(2)$. We show that the method, which is based on encoding the value of the modular-variable of the oscillator into the spin, has a simple semi-classical description in terms of a Bayesian update. We demonstrate the method experimentally using the internal and motional states of a single trapped ion.</description>

      <title>A transition state resonance radically reshapes angular distributions of the F + H2 -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction in the 62.09-101.67 meV energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive angular distributions of the benchmark F + H2(vi = 0) -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction show unusual propensity towards small scattering angles, a subject of a long debate in the literature. We use Regge trajectories to quantify the resonance contributions to state-to-state differential cross sections. Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F +H2 system and its isotopic variant F +HD. For our detailed analysis of angular scattering we employ the package DCS Regge, recently developed for the purpose [Comp. Phys. Comm., 2022, 277, 108370.]</description>

      <title>Integrating Quantum Computing Resources into Scientific HPC Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) offers significant potential to enhance scientific discovery in fields such as quantum chemistry, optimization, and artificial intelligence. Yet QC faces challenges due to the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era's inherent external noise issues. This paper discusses the integration of QC as a computational accelerator within classical scientific high-performance computing (HPC) systems. By leveraging a broad spectrum of simulators and hardware technologies, we propose a hardware-agnostic framework for augmenting classical HPC with QC capabilities. Drawing on the HPC expertise of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the HPC lifecycle management of the Department of Energy (DOE), our approach focuses on the strategic incorporation of QC capabilities and acceleration into existing scientific HPC workflows. This includes detailed analyses, benchmarks, and code optimization driven by the needs of the DOE and ORNL missions. Our comprehensive framework integrates hardware, software, workflows, and user interfaces to foster a synergistic environment for quantum and classical computing research. This paper outlines plans to unlock new computational possibilities, driving forward scientific inquiry and innovation in a wide array of research domains.</description>

      <title>Optical Spring Tracking for Enhancing Quantum-Limited Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern interferometers such as LIGO have achieved sensitivities limited by quantum noise, comprised of radiation pressure and shot noise. To mitigate this noise, a static system is employed that minimizes the quantum noise within the measurement band. However, since gravitational wave inspiral signals are a single frequency changing over time, only noise at the chirp frequency needs to be minimized. Here we demonstrate dynamically tracking a target signal using an optical spring, resulting in an increased signal to noise ratio (SNR). We report on a SNR increase by up to a factor of 40 when compared to a static configuration.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating two-particle interference with a one-dimensional delta potential well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the exchange symmetry of wave functions for identical particles has observable effects, including the widely studied Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect. A theoretical description using second quantization is elegant but abstract. In contrast, this paper describes a simple model of two-particle interference using a one-dimensional delta potential well as a beam splitter. The conditions for the HOM effect are derived from the perspective of wave packet evolution. Furthermore, the interference processes of bosons, fermions and distinguishable particles are demonstrated and compared in detail. The method presented here is concrete, easy to visualize, and can help students to better understand the effects arising from the exchange symmetry of wave functions. The main results can be animated for classroom teaching or developed into an undergraduate seminar topic.</description>

      <title>Quantum Programming Without the Quantum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum programming paradigm where all data are familiar classical data, and the only non-classical element is a random number generator that can return results with negative probability. Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage via Efficient Post-processing on Qudit Shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently computing the trace of the product of exponential-scale matrices $A$ and $B$ presents a significant challenge in classical computation, particularly when $A$ is a $d$-dimensional positive Hermitian matrix with trace 1, and $B$ is a Hermitian matrix with a bounded norm. This computation traditionally requires $O(d^2)$ time complexity. We explore leveraging quantum advantage to perform this computation in $O(\text{poly}(\log d))$ time for a broad class of matrices $A$, offering potential applications in high-dimensional data analysis and complex systems. We propose a shadow tomography scheme for arbitrary $d$-dimensional systems that utilizes random projective measurements onto Dense Dual Bases for efficient sampling and post-processing. Unlike random Clifford or mutually unbiased bases (MUB) measurements, our method is experimentally feasible on optical platforms. It requires exponentially fewer computations to determine all coefficients of the randomly projected states, with a constant post-processing time per measurement, as opposed to the exponential worst-case scenario seen with random Clifford (MUB) measurements. For general dimensions $d$, the existence of $d+1$ MUBs in general dimensions is still an open question, and the processing of randomized Clifford measurements is not fully understood. While the applicability of matrix $A$ may be more limited compared to random Clifford measurements, our approach remains efficient in several cases, with average performance that is particularly efficient. For all $A$, the computational complexity is $O(d)$, and in the approximately average case, it is $O(\text{poly}(\log d))$. This scheme holds significant potential beyond quantum information science; it could be instrumental in fields such as artificial intelligence, enabling efficient computation of $\text{tr}(AB)$.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In the context of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain extensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but noises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce quantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This circuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative frequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a recoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate reliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises. Remarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity and robust controlled-Z gates implemented with Rydberg atoms via echoing rapid adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity and robust quantum gates are essential for quantum information processing, where neutral Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays serving as a versatile platform for the implementation. We propose a rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) scheme for achieving a high-fidelity controlled-Z (CZ) gate on a neutral atom Rydberg platform. Utilizing only global laser dressing, our scheme involves echoing two identical RAP pulses within the Rydberg blockade regime to realize a CZ gate and can be readily extended to a C$^k$Z gate with additional qubits. We predict a CZ gate with fidelity over 0.9995 using akali-atom parameters, and a CCZ gate with fidelity exceeding 0.999. Moreover, the direct utilization of echoing RAP pulses enables the implementation of a four-bit CCCZ gate at fidelity over 0.996 without further optimization. The proposed scheme, remarkably robust to variations in driving fields and realistic decoherence effects, holds promise for future quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is emerging as a promising application of quantum computing due to its distinct way of encoding and processing data. It is believed that large-scale quantum machine learning demonstrates substantial advantages over classical counterparts, but a reliable scale-up is hindered by the fragile nature of quantum systems. Here we present an experimentally accessible distributed quantum machine learning scheme that integrates quantum processor units via classical communication. As a demonstration, we perform data classification tasks on 8-dimensional synthetic datasets by emulating two 4-qubit processors and employing quantum convolutional neural networks. Our results indicate that incorporating classical communication notably improves classification accuracy compared to schemes without communication. Furthermore, at the tested circuit depths, we observe that the accuracy with classical communication is no less than that achieved with quantum communication. Our work provides a practical path to demonstrating large-scale quantum machine learning on intermediate-scale quantum processors by leveraging classical communication that can be implemented through currently available mid-circuit measurements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advocates for an innovative approach designed for estimating optoelectronic properties of quantum structures utilizing Tight-Binding (TB) theory. Predicated on the comparative analysis between estimated and actual properties, the study strives to validate the efficacy of this proposed technique; focusing notably on the computation of bandgap energy. It is observed that preceding methodologies offered a restricted accuracy when predicting complex structures like super-lattices and quantum wells. To address this gap, we propose a methodology involving three distinct phases using orbital interaction parameters (OIPs) and the TB theory. The research employed Aluminium Arsenide (AlAs) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as the primary bulk materials. Our novel approach introduces a computation framework that first focuses on bulk computation, subsequently expanding to super-lattice structures. The findings of this research demonstrate promising results regarding the accuracy of predicated optoelectronic properties, particularly the cut-off wavelength. This study paves the way for future research, potentially enhancing the precision of the proposed methodology and its application scope within the field of quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Measuring entanglement along collective operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for the study of multiparty entanglement by analyzing the behavior of collective variables. Throughout the manuscript, we explore a specific type of multiparty entanglement which can be detected through the fluctuation of a collective observable. We thoroughly analyze its properties and how it can be extended to mixed states while placing it within the context of the existing literature. The novelty of our approach also lies in the fact that we present a graphical point of view. This is done by introducing a spectral space on which the various properties of our entanglement quantifier have a direct pictorial interpretation. Notably, this approach proves particularly effective for assessing $k$-entanglement, as we show its ability to extend previously established inequalities. To enhance understanding, we also demonstrate how this framework applies to specific scenarios, encompassing both finite-dimensional cases and infinite-dimensional systems, the latter being exemplified by the time-frequency modal degree of freedom of co-propagating single photons.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally separating noisy $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ from bounded polynomial threshold circuits of constant depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classes of constant-depth circuits with gates that compute restricted polynomial threshold functions, recently introduced by [Kum23] as a family that strictly generalizes $\mathsf{AC}^0$. Denoting these circuit families $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ for $\textit{bounded polynomial threshold circuits}$ parameterized by an integer-valued degree-bound $k$, we prove three hardness results separating these classes from constant-depth quantum circuits ($\mathsf{QNC}^0$).
  $\hspace{2em}$ - We prove that the parity halving problem [WKS+19], which $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ over qubits can solve with certainty, remains average-case hard for polynomial size $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits for all $k=\mathcal{O}(n^{1/(5d)})$.
  $\hspace{2em}$ - We construct a new family of relation problems based on computing $\mathsf{mod}\ p$ for each prime $p&gt;2$, and prove a separation of $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits over higher dimensional quantum systems (`qupits') against $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits for the same degree-bound parameter as above.
  $\hspace{2em}$ - We prove that both foregoing results are noise-robust under the local stochastic noise model, by introducing fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford $\mathsf{QNC}^0/|\overline{T^{1/p}}&gt;$ circuits, that use logical magic states as advice.
  $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits can compute certain classes of Polynomial Threshold Functions (PTFs), which in turn serve as a natural model for neural networks and exhibit enhanced expressivity and computational capabilities. Furthermore, for large enough values of $k$, $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ contains $\mathsf{TC}^0$ as a subclass. The main challenges we overcome include establishing classical average-case lower bounds, designing non-local games with quantum-classical gaps in winning probabilities and developing noise-resilient non-Clifford quantum circuits necessary to extend beyond qubits to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Hyperentangled Complex Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperentangled states are highly efficient and resource economical. This is because they enhance the quantum information encoding capabilities due to the correlated engagement of more than one degree of freedom of the same quantum entity while keeping the physical resources at their minimum. Therefore, initially the photonic hyperentangled states have been explored extensively but the generation and respective manipulation of the atomic counterpart states are still limited to only few proposals. In this work, we propose a new and feasible scheme to engineer the atomic hyperentangled cluster and ring graph states invoking cavity QED technique for applicative relevance to quantum biology and quantum communications utilizing the complex quantum networks. These states are engineered using both external quantized momenta states and energy levels of neutral atoms under off-resonant and resonant Atomic Bragg Diffraction (ABD) technique. The study of dynamical capacity and potential efficiency have certainly enhanced the range of usefulness of these states. In order to assess the operational behavior of such states when subjected to a realistic noise environment has also been simulated, demonstrating long enough sustainability of the proposed states. Moreover, experimental feasibility of the proposed scheme has also been elucidated under the prevailing cavity-QED research scenario.</description>

      <title>Improved Circuit Lower Bounds With Applications to Exponential Separations Between Quantum and Classical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kumar used a switching lemma to prove exponential-size lower bounds for a circuit class GC^0 that not only contains AC^0 but can--with a single gate--compute functions that require exponential-size TC^0 circuits. His main result was that switching-lemma lower bounds for AC^0 lift to GC^0 with no loss in parameters, even though GC^0 requires exponential-size TC^0 circuits. Informally, GC^0 is AC^0 with unbounded-fan-in gates that behave arbitrarily inside a sufficiently small Hamming ball but must be constant outside it.
  We show an analogous result for GC^0[p] (GC^0 with MODp gates) and the polynomial method. Specifically, we show that polynomial-method lower bounds for AC^0[p] lift to GC^0[p] with no loss in parameters. As an application, we prove Majority requires depth-d GC^0[p] circuits of size $2^{\Omega(n^{1/2(d-1)})}$, matching the state-of-the-art lower bounds for AC^0[p]. We also show that E^NP requires exponential-size GCC^0 circuits (the union of GC^0[m] for all m), extending the result of Williams.
  It is striking that the switching lemma, polynomial method, and algorithmic method all generalize to GC^0-related classes, with the first two methods doing so without any loss.
  We also establish the strongest known unconditional separations between quantum and classical circuits:
  1. There's an oracle relative to which BQP is not contained in the class of languages decidable by uniform families of size-$2^{n^{O(1)}}$ GC^0 circuits, generalizing Raz and Tal's relativized separation of BQP from the polynomial hierarchy.
  2. There's a search problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but average-case hard for exponential-size GC^0 circuits.
  3. There's a search problem that QNC^0/qpoly circuits can solve but average-case hard for exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits.
  4. There's an interactive problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits cannot.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sieving for Code-Based Cryptanalysis and Its Limitations for ISD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sieving using near-neighbor search techniques is a well-known method in lattice-based cryptanalysis, yielding the current best runtime for the shortest vector problem in both the classical [BDGL16] and quantum [BCSS23] setting. Recently, sieving has also become an important tool in code-based cryptanalysis. Specifically, using a sieving subroutine, [GJN23, DEEK24] presented a variant of the information-set decoding (ISD) framework, which is commonly used for attacking cryptographically relevant instances of the decoding problem. The resulting sieving-based ISD framework yields complexities close to the best-performing classical algorithms for the decoding problem such as [BJMM12, BM18]. It is therefore natural to ask how well quantum versions perform. In this work, we introduce the first quantum algorithms for code sieving by designing quantum variants of the aforementioned sieving subroutine. In particular, using quantum-walk techniques, we provide a speed-up over the best known classical algorithm from [DEEK24] and over a variant using Grover's algorithm [Gro96]. Our quantum-walk algorithm exploits the structure of the underlying search problem by adding a layer of locality-sensitive filtering, inspired by the quantum-walk algorithm for lattice sieving from [CL21]. We complement our asymptotic analysis of the quantum algorithms with numerical results, and observe that our quantum speed-ups for code sieving behave similarly as those observed in lattice sieving. In addition, we show that a natural quantum analog of the sieving-based ISD framework does not provide any speed-up over the first presented quantum ISD algorithm [Ber10]. Our analysis highlights that the framework should be adapted in order to outperform the state-of-the-art of quantum ISD algorithms [KT17, Kir18].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent spin resonance methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy have led to spectrally highly sensitive, non-invasive quantum imaging techniques with groundbreaking applications in fields such as medicine, biology, and physics. Meanwhile, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers detailed investigations with sub-atomic resolution, but often inflicts significant radiation damage. Here we exploit synergies and report on an integration of ESR spectroscopy in a TEM. Our miniaturized ESR setup on a standard TEM sample holder leverages the strong magnetic field of the TEM polepiece to align and energetically separate spin states. This integration will facilitate in-situ studies of spin systems and their dynamics, quantum materials, radicals, electrochemical reactions, and radiation damage - properties previously mainly invisible to electron microscopic tools. Moreover, this development marks a significant technological advancement toward microwave-controlled quantum spin studies with a highly controlled electron probe at the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: We implement the Multi-Reference Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (MR-UCCSD) model with a quantum circuit that conserves the particle number to study the ground state energies of LiH, BeH$_2$, and H$_6$. This approach simplifies the MR-UCCSD computation by integrating quantum computing techniques, and reduces its complexity. As a profit of the better MR states, our MR-UCCSD approach satisfies systematically the predefined errors below 10$^{-5}$ Hartree,which is the highest precision of single reference UCCSD approach, along the whole bond length with only hundreds of CNOT gates, and meets satisfactory the requirements of both computational precision and quantum resource reduction.</description>

      <title>Circuit QED Emission Spectra in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime: How They Differ from Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between resonator-confined radiation and natural atoms or other formally equivalent quantum excitations, under conditions where the quantum nature of photons is relevant. Phenomena studied in cavity QED can also be explored using superconducting artificial atoms and microwave photons in superconducting resonators. These circuit QED systems offer the possibility to reach the ultrastrong coupling regime with individual artificial atoms, unlike their natural counterparts. In this regime, the light-matter coupling rate reaches a considerable fraction of the bare resonance frequencies in the system. Here, we provide a careful analysis of the emission spectra in circuit QED systems consisting of a flux qubit interacting with an LC resonator. Despite these systems can be described by the quantum Rabi model, as the corresponding cavity QED ones, we find distinctive features, depending on how the system is coupled with the output port, which become evident in the ultrastrong coupling regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements of gravitational acceleration, or gravimetry, enable the testing of physical theories and find numerous applications in geodesy and space exploration. By harnessing quantum effects, high-precision sensors can achieve sensitivity and accuracy far beyond their classical counterparts when using the same number of sensing resources. Therefore, developing gravimeters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity is essential for advancing theoretical and applied physics. While novel quantum gravimeters have already been proposed for this purpose, the ultimate sensing precision, known as the Heisenberg limit, remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the gravimetry precision in a conditional displacement spin-mechanical system increases quadratically with the number of spins: a Heisenberg-limited spin-mechanical gravimeter. In general, the gravitational parameter is dynamically encoded into the entire entangled spin-mechanical probe. However, at some specific times, the mechanical degree of freedom disentangles from the spin subsystem, transferring all the information about the gravitational acceleration to the spin subsystem. Hence, we prove that a feasible spin magnetization measurement can reveal the ultimate gravimetry precision at such disentangling times. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed system is robust against spin-mechanical coupling anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Embedded Complexity and Quantum Circuit Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit complexity is a pivotal concept in quantum information, quantum many-body physics, and high-energy physics. While extensively studied for closed systems, the characterization and dynamics of circuit complexity are little understood for the situation where the system is embedded within a larger system, which encompasses measurement-assisted state preparation. To address this gap, we introduce the notion of embedded complexity, which accounts for both system extensions and measurements. We study the complexity of projected states in a subsystem after measuring its complement and find that in random circuits, the embedded complexity is lower-bounded by the circuit volume -- the total number of gates affecting both the subsystem and its complement. This finding indicates that the total cost of preparing the projected state cannot be reduced by leveraging ancillary qubits and measurements in general. Our result underscores the operational meaning of circuit volume, as it characterizes the embedded complexity of the generated state. Specifically, for random circuits or Clifford circuits, we demonstrate a spacetime conversion that concentrates circuit volume onto a subsystem via a random gate teleportation approach. In scenarios of deep thermalization where the system interacts extensively with a larger system, our analysis suggests that the resulting projected states exhibit high complexity. Additionally, we introduce a shadow tomography protocol that employs only ancillary random states and Bell state measurements, circumventing the need to evolve the input state and thereby simplifying experimental controls.</description>

      <title>Long-Range $ZZ$ Interaction via Resonator-Induced Phase in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computing emerges as one of leading candidates for achieving quantum advantage. However, a prevailing challenge is the coding overhead due to limited quantum connectivity, constrained by nearest-neighbor coupling among superconducting qubits. Here, we propose a novel multimode coupling scheme using three resonators driven by in-phase and quadrature microwaves, based on the resonator-induced phase gate, to extend the $ZZ$ interaction distance between qubits. We demonstrate a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 99.9\% within 160 ns at free spectral range (FSR) of 1.3 GHz, and by optimizing driving pulses, we further reduce the residual photon to nearly $10^{-3}$ within 100 ns at FSR of 0.2 GHz. These facilitate the long-range CZ gate over separations reaching sub-meters, thus significantly enhancing qubit connectivity and making a practical step towards the scalable integration and modularization of quantum processors. Specifically, our approach supports the implementation of quantum error correction codes requiring high connectivity, such as low-density parity check codes that paves the way to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence from complex saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the effect that bridges quantum physics to well-understood classical physics. As such, it plays a crucial role in understanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics represented by Schr\"odinger's cat, for example. Quantum decoherence is also a source of quantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in various experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our work to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the distinguishability between quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. In this paper, we develop optimal quantum algorithms that estimate both the trace distance and the (square root) fidelity between pure states to within additive error $\varepsilon$ using $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to their state-preparation circuits, quadratically improving the long-standing folklore $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$. At the heart of our construction, is an algorithmic tool for quantum square root amplitude estimation, which generalizes the well-known quantum amplitude estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters will require sources of entanglement allowing efficient coupling to quantum memories. Here, we address this challenge with a compact, narrowband source design. The entangled pairs are generated via SPDC in two perpendicularly oriented nonlinear crystals in a Fabry-P\'e{}rot cavity. We show that the case of highly non-degenerate wavelengths and type-II phase matching is the most promising candidate for a practical implementation. Using the parameters of an experiment we are currently working on, this design should allow generating entangled photons with a bandwidth of a few MHz.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a V-type atom inside a deformed cavity field and in the presence of an external Microwave field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the interaction between a V-type atom inside a single mode deformed cavity field in the presence of an external microwave field. The Hamiltonian describing the system is derived from the standard Jaynes-Cummings model by deforming the field operators based on the Kerr-induced interaction. The total and reduced density matrices are obtained and the temporal evolution of nonclassical properties such as the Mandel Q parameter, quantum entanglement, and the position-momentum uncertainty relation (squeezing) of the field are examined. The impacts of coupling constant, generalized Kerr medium, and the intensity-dependent coupling function on the nonclassical indicators are thoroughly analyzed.</description>

      <title>An algebraic characterisation of Kochen-Specker contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is a key distinguishing feature between classical and quantum physics. It expresses a fundamental obstruction to describing quantum theory using classical concepts. In turn, understood as a resource for quantum computation, it is expected to hold the key to quantum advantage. Yet, despite its long recognised importance in quantum foundations and, more recently, in quantum computation, the structural essence of contextuality has remained somewhat elusive - different frameworks address different aspects of the phenomenon, yet their precise relationship often remains unclear. This issue already looms large at the level of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem: while traditional proofs proceed by showing the nonexistence of valuations, the notion of state-independent contextuality in the marginal approach allows to prove contextuality from seemingly weaker assumptions. In the light of this, and at the absence of a unified mathematical framework for Kochen-Specker contextuality, the original algebraic approach has been widely abandoned, in favour of the study of contextual correlations.
  Here, we reinstate the algebraic perspective on contextuality. Concretely, by building on the novel concept of context connections, we reformulate the algebraic relations between observables originally postulated by Kochen and Specker, and we explicitly demonstrate their consistency with the notion of state-independent contextuality. In the present paper, we focus on the new conceptual ideas and discuss them in the concrete setting of spin-1 observables, specifically those in the example of [S. Yu and C.H. Oh, Phys. Rev. Lett., 108, 030402 (2012)]; in a companion paper, we generalise these ideas, obtain a complete characterisation of Kochen-Specker contextuality and provide a detailed comparison with the related notions of contextuality in the marginal and graph-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>CFLOBDDs: Context-Free-Language Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06818v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new compressed representation of Boolean functions, called CFLOBDDs (for Context-Free-Language Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams). They are essentially a plug-compatible alternative to BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams), and hence useful for representing certain classes of functions, matrices, graphs, relations, etc. in a highly compressed fashion. CFLOBDDs share many of the good properties of BDDs, but--in the best case--the CFLOBDD for a Boolean function can be exponentially smaller than any BDD for that function. Compared with the size of the decision tree for a function, a CFLOBDD--again, in the best case--can give a double-exponential reduction in size. They have the potential to permit applications to (i) execute much faster, and (ii) handle much larger problem instances than has been possible heretofore.
  CFLOBDDs are a new kind of decision diagram that go beyond BDDs (and their many relatives). The key insight is a new way to reuse sub-decision-diagrams: components of CFLOBDDs are structured hierarchically, so that sub-decision-diagrams can be treated as standalone ''procedures'' and reused.
  We applied CFLOBDDs to the problem of simulating quantum circuits, and found that for several standard problems the improvement in scalability--compared to simulation using BDDs--is quite dramatic. In particular, the number of qubits that could be handled using CFLOBDDs was larger, compared to BDDs, by a factor of 128x for GHZ; 1,024x for BV; 8,192x for DJ; and 128x for Grover's algorithm. (With a 15-minute timeout, the number of qubits that CFLOBDDs can handle are 65,536 for GHZ, 524,288 for BV; 4,194,304 for DJ; and 4,096 for Grover's Algorithm.)</description>

      <title>Quantum Teleportation using Quantum Candies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Candies or Qandies provide us with a lucid way of understanding the concepts of quantum information and quantum science in the language of candies. The critical idea of qandies is intuitively depicting quantum science to the general public, making sense as most of the research in this domain is funded by the taxpayers. The qandies model is already used to explain the essential concepts of quantum science and quantum cryptography. However, teleportation and related concepts are yet to be explained. Motivated by this fact, we investigate and extend the idea of Jacobs and Lin-Mor-Shapira to explain teleportation using qandies. Here, we explicitly design the teleportation protocol and perform a circuit model using qandy gates. The protocol is successful when the correlated qandies are appropriately pre-shared and use of some local operations at both ends. The model we develop can be a valuable tool for science and engineering educators who want to help the general public to gain more insights into quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Spin-Active Interface and Locally Enhanced Zeeman field in a Superconductor-Chiral Material Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A localized Zeeman field, intensified at heterostructure interfaces, could play a crucial role in a broad area including spintronics and unconventional superconductors. Conventionally, the generation of a local Zeeman field is achieved through magnetic exchange coupling with a magnetic material. However, magnetic elements often introduce defects, which could weaken or destroy superconductivity. Alternatively, the coupling between a superconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling and a non-magnetic chiral material could serve as a promising approach to generate a spin active interface. In this study, we leverage an interface superconductor, namely induced superconductivity in noble metal surface states, to probe the spin active interface. Our results unveil an enhanced interface Zeeman field, which selectively closes the surface superconducting gap while preserving the bulk superconducting pairing. The chiral material, i.e. trigonal tellurium, also induces Andreev bound states (ABS) exhibiting spin polarization. The field dependence of ABS manifests a substantially enhanced interface Land\'e g-factor (g_eff ~ 12), thereby corroborating the enhanced interface Zeeman energy.</description>

      <title>Studies of the Fermi-Hubbard Model Using Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum computers to calculate the ground state (lowest) energies of a spin lattice of electrons described by the Fermi-Hubbard model of great importance in condensed matter physics has been studied. The ability of quantum bits (qubits) to be in a superposition state allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations that are not possible with even the most powerful classical (digital) computers. This work has established a method for calculating the ground state energies of small lattices which should be scalable to larger lattices that cannot be calculated by classical computers. Half-filled lattices of sizes 1x4, 2x2, 2x4, and 3x4 were studied. The calculated energies for the 1x4 and 2x2 lattices without Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and for the 1x4 lattice with Coulomb repulsion agrees with the true energies to within 0.60%, while for the 2x2 lattice with Coulomb repulsion the agreement is within 1.50% For the 2x4 lattice, the true energy without Coulomb repulsion was found to agree within 0.18%.</description>

      <title>Realization of geometric phase topology induced by multiple exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have Riemann surface structures of complex eigenvalues that admit singularities known as exceptional points. Combining with geometric phases of eigenstates gives rise to unique properties of non-Hermitian systems, and their classifications have been studied recently. However, the physical realizations of classes of the classifications have been relatively limited because a small number of modes and exceptional points are involved. In this work, we show in microcavities that all five classes [J.-W. Ryu, et al., Commun. Phys. 7, 109 (2024)] of three modes can emerge with three exceptional points. In demonstrations, we identified various combinations of exceptional points within a two-dimensional parameter space of a single microcavity and defined five distinct encircling loops based on three selected exceptional points. According to the classification, these loops facilitate different mode exchanges and the acquisition of additional geometric phases during the adiabatic encircling of exceptional points. Our results provide a broad description of the geometric phases-associated topology induced by multiple exceptional points in realistic physical systems.</description>

Abstract: We characterise a small footprint travelling-wave parametric amplifier (TWPA). The TWPA is built with magnetically flux-tunable superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive elements (SNAILs) and parallel-plate capacitors. It implements three-wave mixing (3WM) with resonant phase matching (RPM), a small cutoff frequency for high gain per unitcell and impedance matching networks for large bandwidth impedance matching. The device has 200 unitcells and a physical footprint of only 1.1 mm^2, yet demonstrates an average parametric gain of 19 dB over a 3 GHz bandwidth, an average effective signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 10 dB and a clear speedup of qubit readout time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competing interactions in quantum magnets lead to a variety of emergent states, including ordered phases, nematic magnets and quantum spin liquids. Among them, topological quantum magnets represent a promising platform to create topological excitations protected by the bulk many-body excitation gap. Here we establish the phase diagram of a breathing frustrated antiferromagnetic J1-J2-Heisenberg model, featuring both ordered states and a higher-order topological quantum magnet state. Using exact many-body methods based on neural network quantum states and tensor networks, we determine the existence of a first order phase transition between stripe order and the topological quantum magnet and the second order phase transition between the Neel order and quantum magnet phase, further corroborated by calculations of the many-body gap. Using an auxiliary fermion parton formalism, we show the emergence of topological spinon corner modes stemming from the breathing order parameter of the parent Heisenberg model. Our results establish the breathing frustrated square lattice Heisenberg model as a paradigmatic system to engineer topological quantum magnetism, as recently realized in Ti lattices at MgO.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: exact solutions and dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <title>Evolution of two-magnon bound states in a higher-spin ferromagnetic chain with single-ion anisotropy: A complete solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-magnon bound states in quantum spin chains have been long studied and attracted much recent attentions. For a higher-spin ferromagnetic XXZ chain with single-ion anisotropy, several features regarding the evolution of the low-lying two-magnon bound states with varying wave number were observed in the literature. However, most of these observations are only qualitatively understood due to the lack of analytical tools. By combining a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states and a plane-wave ansatz, we achieve a complete solution of the two-magnon problem in such a system. We identify parameter regions that support different types of two-magnon bound states, with the boundaries defined by algebraic equations. We discover for the first time a narrow region in which two single-ion bound states coexist. We show that the phase diagrams for distinct wave numbers are similar to each other, which enables us to map the evolution of the bound states to the rectilinear movement of a representative point for given parameters in a rescaled phase diagram. This dynamic picture provides quantitative interpretations of the observed features.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>In-situ scanning gate imaging of individual two-level material defects in live superconducting quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low temperature physics of structurally amorphous materials is governed by two-level system defects (TLS), the exact origin and nature of which remain elusive despite decades of study. Recent advances towards realising stable high-coherence platforms for quantum computing has increased the importance of studying TLS in solid-state quantum circuits, as they are a persistent source of decoherence and instability. Here we perform scanning gate microscopy on a live superconducting quantum circuit at millikelvin temperatures to locate individual TLS. Our method directly reveals the microscopic nature of TLS and is also capable of deducing the three dimensional orientation of individual TLS electric dipole moments. Such insights, when combined with structural information of the underlying materials, can help unravel the detailed microscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing strategies for their eventual mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry refers to the study of measuring ultra-low temperatures in quantum systems. The precision of such a quantum thermometer is limited by the degree to which temperature can be estimated by quantum measurements. More precisely, the maximal precision is given by the inverse of the quantum Fisher information. In the present analysis, we show that quantum thermometers that are described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations allow for a significantly enhanced precision, that means larger quantum Fisher information. This is demonstrated for a variety of pedagogical scenarios consisting of single and two-qubits systems. The enhancement in precision is indicated by non-vanishing quantum speed limits, which originate in the fact that the thermal, Gibbs state is typically not invariant under the nonlinear equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Digital stabilization of an IQ modulator in the carrier suppressed single side-band (CS-SSB) mode for atom interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an all-digital method for stabilising the phase biases in an electro-optic I/Q modulator for carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. Building on the method presented in S. Wald \ea, Appl. Opt. \textbf{62}, 1-7 (2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and demodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical carrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $&gt;23\,\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\,\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\circ\rm C$.</description>

Abstract: Laser spectroscopy and interferometry have provided an unparalleled view into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe through ultra-precise measurements of atomic transition frequencies and gravitational waves. Optical frequency combs have expanded metrology capabilities by phase-coherently bridging radio frequency and optical domains to enable traceable high-resolution spectroscopy across bandwidths greater than hundreds of terahertz. However, quantum mechanics limits the measurement precision achievable with laser frequency combs and traditional laser sources, ultimately impacting fundamental interferometry and spectroscopy. Squeezing the distribution of quantum noise to enhance measurement precision of either the amplitude or phase quadrature of an optical field leads to significant measurement improvements with continuous wave lasers. In this work, we generate bright amplitude-squeezed frequency comb light and apply it to molecular spectroscopy using interferometry that leverages the high-speed and broad spectral coverage of the dual-comb technique. Using the Kerr effect in nonlinear optical fiber, the amplitude quadrature of a frequency comb centered at 1560 nm is squeezed by &gt;3 dB over a 2.5 THz of bandwidth that includes 2500 comb teeth spaced by 1 GHz. Interferometry with a second coherent state frequency comb yields mode-resolved spectroscopy of hydrogen sulfide gas with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nearly 3 dB beyond the shot noise limit, taking full metrological advantage of the amplitude squeezing when the electrical noise floor is considered. The quantum noise reduction leads to a two-fold quantum speedup in the determination of gas concentration, with impact for fast, broadband, and high SNR ratio measurements of multiple species in dynamic chemical environments.</description>

      <title>The relevance of degenerate states in chiral polaritonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore theoretically whether a parity-violating/chiral light-matter interaction is required to capture all relevant aspects of chiral polaritonics or if a parity-conserving/achiral theory is sufficient (e.g. long-wavelength/dipole approximation). This question is non-trivial to answer, since achiral theories (Hamiltonians) still possess chiral solutions. To elucidate this fundamental theoretical question, a simple GaAs quantum ring model is coupled to an effective chiral mode of a single-handedness optical cavity in dipole approximation. The bare matter GaAs quantum ring possesses a non-degenerate ground state and a doubly degenerate first excited state. The chiral or achiral nature (superpositions) of the degenerate excited state remains undetermined for an isolated matter system. However, inside our parity-conserving description of a chiral cavity, we find that the dressed eigenstates automatically (ab-initio) attain chiral character and become energetically discriminated based on the handedness of the cavity. In contrast, the non-degenerate bare matter state (ground state) does not show an energetic discrimination inside a chiral cavity within dipole approximation. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the handedness of the cavity can still be imprinted onto these states (e.g. angular momentum and chiral current densities). Overall, above findings highlight the relevance of degenerate states in chiral polaritonics. In particularly because recent theoretical results indicate the formation of a frustrated and highly-degenerate electronic ground-state under collective strong coupling conditions, which thus might be prone to chiral symmetry breaking effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future information processing technologies like quantum memory devices have the potential to store and transfer quantum states to enable quantum computing and networking. A central consideration in practical applications for such devices is the nature of the light-matter interface which determines the storage state density and efficiency. Here, we employ an organic radical, $\alpha$,$\gamma$-bisdiphenylene-$\beta$-phenylallyl (BDPA) doped into an o-terphenyl host to explore the potential for using tuneable and high-performance molecular media in microwave-based quantum applications. We demonstrate that this radical system exhibits millisecond-long spin-lattice relaxation and microsecond-long phase memory times at room temperature, while also having the capability to generate an oscillating spin-polarized state using a co-dissolved photo-activated tetraphenylporphyrin moiety, all enabled by using a viscous liquid host. This latest system builds upon collective wisdom from previous molecules-for-quantum literature by combining careful host matrix selection, with dynamical decoupling, and photoexcited triplet-radical spin polarisation to realise a versatile and robust quantum spin medium.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between a disjoint subsystem and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to atom-membrane dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle, a time-dependent description of the dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a bosonic bath is formulated. The method is applied to the case of a gas of cold atoms adsorbing via phonon creation to an elastic membrane at finite temperature. The time-dependence of the system state is analytically calculated using Laplace transform methods, and a closed-form expression for the transition rate is obtained. Atoms in the gas transition to the adsorbed state through a Feshbach resonance that has contributions from a distribution of vibrational modes of the membrane. The resonance can decay with the creation of a phonon to complete the adsorption process. The adsorption rate at low membrane temperature agrees with the golden rule estimate to lowest order in the coupling constant for values greater than a critical coupling strength. Below this critical coupling strength, the adsorption rate is exponentially suppressed by a phonon reduction factor whose exponent diverges with increasing adsorbent size. The rate changes discontinuously with coupling strength for low temperature membranes, and the magnitude of the discontinuity decreases with increasing temperature. These variational results suggest the quantum adsorption model may contain a first-order phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an architecture for a multimode quantum battery (QB) based on the framework of continuous variable (CV) systems. We examine the performance of the battery by using a generic class of multimode initial states whose parameters can be tuned to produce separable as well as entangled states and that can be charged locally as well as globally by Gaussian unitary operations. Analytical calculations show that a separable state is equally advantageous to an entangled one for two- and three-mode batteries when taking the figures of merit as the second moments of the change in energy. In order to produce a stable quantum battery consisting of an arbitrary number of modes, we derive compact analytical forms of the energy fluctuations and prove that for a multimode separable Gaussian initial state, fluctuations decrease as the number of modes increases, thereby obtaining a scaling analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that local displacement as a charger is better for minimizing the fluctuations in energy than that involving the squeezing unitary operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating generic matrix functions more amenable to early fault-tolerant quantum hardware than standard quantum singular-value transformations. The method is based on randomization over the Chebyshev approximation of the target function while keeping the matrix oracle quantum, and is assisted by a variant of the Hadamard test that removes the need for post-selection. The resulting statistical overhead is similar to the fully quantum case and does not incur any circuit depth degradation. On the contrary, the average circuit depth is shown to get smaller, yielding equivalent reductions in noise sensitivity, as explicitly shown for depolarizing noise and coherent errors. We apply our technique to partition-function estimation, linear system solvers, and ground-state energy estimation. For these cases, we prove advantages on average depths, including quadratic speed-ups on costly parameters and even the removal of the approximation-error dependence.</description>

      <title>Perfect quantum protractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and investigate the concept of a perfect quantum protractor, a pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle\in\mathcal{H}$ that generates three different orthogonal bases of $\mathcal{H}$ under rotations around each of the three perpendicular axes. Such states can be understood as pure states of maximal uncertainty with regards to the three components of the angular momentum operator, as we prove that they maximise various entropic and variance-based measures of such uncertainty. We argue that perfect quantum protractors can only exist for systems with a well-defined total angular momentum $j$, and we prove that they do not exist for $j\in\{1/2,2,5/2\}$, but they do exist for $j\in\{1,3/2,3\}$ (with numerical evidence for their existence when $j=7/2$). We also explain that perfect quantum protractors form an optimal resource for a metrological task of estimating the angle of rotation around (or the strength of magnetic field along) one of the three perpendicular axes, when the axis is not $\textit{a priori}$ known. Finally, we demonstrate this metrological utility by performing an experiment with warm atomic vapours of rubidium-87, where we prepare a perfect quantum protractor for a spin-1 system, let it precess around $x$, $y$ or $z$ axis, and then employ it to optimally estimate the rotation angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantum computing relies on the precision of quantum gates. However, quantum gates in practice are generally affected by dissipative environments, which can significantly reduce their fidelity. In this study, we elucidate fundamental relations between the average fidelity of generic quantum gates and the dissipation that occurs during the computing processes. Considering scenarios in which a quantum gate is subject to Markovian environments, we rigorously derive fidelity-dissipation relations that hold for arbitrary operational times. Intriguingly, when the quantum gate undergoes thermal relaxation, the result can be used as a valuable tool for estimating dissipation through experimentally measurable fidelity, without requiring detailed knowledge of the dissipative structure. For the case of arbitrary environments, we uncover a trade-off relation between the average fidelity and energy dissipation, implying that these quantities cannot be large simultaneously. Our results unveil the computational limitations imposed by thermodynamics, shedding light on the profound connection between thermodynamics and quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical transition from a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the recently introduced lifted product to construct a family of Quantum Low Density Parity Check Codes (QLDPC codes). The codes we obtain can be viewed as stacks of surface codes that are interconnected, leading to the name lift-connected surface (LCS) codes. LCS codes offer a wide range of parameters - a particularly striking feature is that they show interesting properties that are favorable compared to the standard surface code. For example, already at moderate numbers of physical qubits in the order of tens, LCS codes of equal size have lower logical error rate or similarly, require fewer qubits for a fixed target logical error rate. We present and analyze the construction and provide numerical simulation results for the logical error rate under code capacity and phenomenological noise. These results show that LCS codes attain thresholds that are comparable to corresponding (non-connected) copies of surface codes, while the logical error rate can be orders of magnitude lower, even for representatives with the same parameters. This provides a code family showing the potential of modern product constructions at already small qubit numbers. Their amenability to 3D-local connectivity renders them particularly relevant for near-term implementations.</description>

      <title>Novel Long Distance Free Space Quantum Secure Direct Communication for Web 3.0 Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09108v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of Web 3.0, the swift advancement of technology confronts an imminent threat from quantum computing. Security protocols safeguarding the integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces our novel long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical contexts. Differing from techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD), LF QSDC surpasses constraints by facilitating encrypted data transmission sans key exchanges, thus diminishing the inherent weaknesses of key-based systems. The distinctiveness of this attribute, coupled with its quantum mechanics base, protects against quantum computer assaults and advanced non-quantum dangers, harmonizing seamlessly with the untrustworthy tenets of the Web 3.0 age. The focus of our study is the technical design and incorporation of LF QSDC into web 3.0 network infrastructures, highlighting its efficacy for extended-range communication. LF QSDC is based on the memory DL04 protocol and enhanced with our novel Quantum-Aware Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC), Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) technologies, and Atmospheric Quantum Correction Algorithm (AQCA). Utilizing this method not only bolsters the security of worldwide Web 3.0 networks but also guarantees their endurance in a time when quantum and sophisticated classical threats exist simultaneously. Consequently, LF QSDC stands out as a robust security solution, well-suited for Web 3.0 systems amidst the constantly evolving digital environment.</description>

      <title>Topological rejection of noise by quantum skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open challenge in the context of quantum information processing and communication is improving the robustness of quantum information to environmental contributions of noise, a severe hindrance in real-world scenarios. Here, we show that quantum skyrmions and their nonlocal topological observables remain resilient to noise even as typical entanglement witnesses and measures of the state decay. This allows us to introduce the notion of digitization of quantum information based on our new discrete topological quantum observables, foregoing the need for robustness of entanglement. We compliment our experiments with a full theoretical treatment that unlocks the quantum mechanisms behind the topological behaviour, explaining why the topology leads to robustness. Our approach holds exciting promise for intrinsic quantum information resilience through topology, highly applicable to real-world systems such as global quantum networks and noisy quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A quantum Pascal pyramid and an extended de Moivre-Laplace theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pascal's triangle is widely used as a pedagogical tool to explain the "first-order" multiplet patterns that arise in the spectra of $I_N S$ coupled spin-1/2 systems in magnetic resonance. Various other combinatorial structures, which may be well-known in the broader field of quantum dynamics, appear to have largely escaped the attention of the magnetic resonance community with a few exceptions, despite potential usefulness.
  In this brief set of lecture notes, we describe a "quantum Pascal pyramid" (OEIS https://oeis.org/A268533) as a generalization of Pascal's triangle, which is shown to directly map the relationship between multispin operators of arbitrary spin product rank $q$ ($\hat{Z}_N^q$) and population operators for states with magnetic quantum number $m$ ($\hat{S}_N^m$), and - as a consequence - obtain the general form of the intensity ratios of multiplets associated with antiphase single-quantum coherences, with an expression given in terms of the Jacobi polynomials.
  An extension of the de Moivre-Laplace theorem, beyond the trivial case $q=0$, is applied to the $q$-th columns of the quantum Pascal pyramid, and is given in terms of a product of the $q$-th order Hermite polynomials and a Gaussian distribution, reproducing the well-known functional forms of the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the classical limit of Hermite-Gaussian modes in laser physics (Allen et al., $\textit{Phys. Rev. A.}$, $\textbf{45}$, 1992). This is used to approximate the Fourier-transformed spectra of $\hat{Z}_N^q$-associated multiplets of arbitrary complexity.
  Finally, an exercise is shown in which the first two columns of the quantum Pascal pyramid are used to calculate the previously known symmetry-constrained upper bound on $I_z \rightarrow S_z$ polarization transfer in $I_N S$ spin systems.</description>

Abstract: algorithm for solving linear systems of equations proposed by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (HHL). We achieve this by using higher precision quantum estimates of the eigenvalues relevant to the linear system, and a new classical step to guide the eigenvalue inversion part of Hybrid HHL. We show that eigenvalue estimates with just two extra bits of precision result in tighter error bounds for our Enhanced Hybrid HHL compared to HHL. Our enhancement reduces the error of Hybrid HHL by an average of 57 percent on an ideal quantum processor for a representative sample of 2x2 systems. On IBM Torino and IonQ Aria-1 hardware, we see that the error of Enhanced Hybrid HHL is on average 13 percent and 20 percent (respectively) less than that of HHL for the same set of systems.</description>

Abstract: A recently developed approach to the thermodynamics of open quantum systems, on the basis of the principle of minimal dissipation, is applied to the spin-boson model. Employing a numerically exact quantum dynamical treatment based on the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we investigate the influence of the environment on quantities such as work, heat and entropy production in a range of parameters which go beyond the weak-coupling limit and include both the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic regimes. The results reveal significant differences to the weak-coupling forms of work, heat and entropy production, which are analyzed in some detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cost and the error of the adiabatic theorem for preparing the final eigenstate are discussed in terms of path length. Previous studies in terms of the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivatives with the spectral gap are limited in their ability to describe the cost of adiabatic state preparation for certain physically large systems. We argue that total time is not a good measure for determining the computational difficulty of adiabatic quantum computation by developing a no-go theorem. From the result of time-periodic Hamiltonian cases, we suggest that there are proxies for computational cost which typically grow as path length increases when the error is kept fixed and small and consider possible conjectures on how general the behavior is.</description>

Abstract: With basis on (i) the physical principle of local causality and (ii) a certain notion of elements of reality, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) put forward an argument showing that physical instances may exist in which two non-commuting observables can be joint elements of the physical reality. Here, we introduce a new criterion of joint reality. We demonstrate that, according to this criterion, quantum mechanics generally prevents non-commuting observables from having joint elements of reality. joint elements of reality. In addition, we introduce a measure to quantify the extent to which the criterion is violated and explore the implications of such a measure in connection with incompatibility and correlations. Our findings suggest new manners of interpreting quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark localization dynamically alters the entanglement behavior of non-Hermitian free fermions. Utilizing the single-particle correlation matrix technique, we analyze the effective Hamiltonian of these fermions with a Wannier-Stark ladder. Under open boundary conditions, we observe the steady state half-chain entanglement entropy and identify two distinct area law regions and an algebraic scaling region. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals critical scaling behavior of the half-chain entanglement entropy. Notably, the system demonstrates unique entanglement characteristics under periodic boundary conditions, which diverge from the (1+1)D conformal field theory predictions for Anderson localization. Our findings highlight novel entanglement phases emerging from the interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and disorder-free localization.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of quantum theory as games between observers and nature played in Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2019, we introduced games in Minkowski spacetime as a generalization of game theory to special relativity that subsumes games in normal form (spacelike separation) and games in extensive form (timelike separation). Many concepts of the game theory literature, including Nash equilibria and flattened strategic forms, naturally extend to spacetime games. We also emphasized the importance of these games to model quantum experiments, such as Bell experiments and more generally any adaptive measurements, from a decision theory perspective. Subsequent work, named causal contextuality scenarios, suggested formalizing a special case of such games in terms of strategy presheaves. If a natural cover is taken, we show that spacetime games recover causal contextuality scenarios as a special case. Spacetime games provide a visual and intuitive framework that captures the distinction between joint experiments and either-or experiments, so that they are rich enough in their causal structure to imply a natural cover for the corresponding causal contextuality scenario. Based on this observation, we suggest defining the strategy presheaf directly based on the pure strategies (and restrictions thereof) in the reduced strategic form of the spacetime game, and we show that the sheaf property obtains for the games at hand. The argument is simple and similar to event sheaves for the flat case. Finally, we explain how, in the other direction, the failure of the sheaf property on strategy distribution presheaves is consistent with our previous argument that Nash game theory is incompatible with quantum physics. This shows that the insights of spacetime games and causal contextuality scenarios, taken together, can contribute positively to the advancement of the field of quantum foundations.</description>

Abstract: The quantum kicked rotor (QKR) is a fundamental model of time-dependent quantum chaos and the physics of Anderson localization. It is one of the most well-studied Floquet systems. In this work, it is shown that QKR can be used to implement a quantum algorithm to perform unstructured search; namely Amplitude Amplification, a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. Further, the QKR is employed for amplitude estimation when the amplitude of the marked states is unknown. It is also shown that the characteristic property of dynamical localization of the QKR can be exploited to enhance the performance of the amplitude amplification algorithm by reducing its average runtime. The sensitivity of the success probability of unstructured search to detuning from resonance and the effects of noisy kick strengths are analyzed and the robustness of the QKR based algorithm is demonstrated. The experimental feasibility of every component of the algorithm is discussed.</description>

      <title>Measurement Induced Magic Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic states and magic gates are crucial for achieving universal computation, but some important questions about how magic resources should be implemented to attain quantum advantage have remained unexplored, for instance, in the context of Measurement-based Quantum Computation (MQC) with only single-qubit measurements. This work bridges the gap between MQC and the resource theory of magic by introducing the concept of ``invested'' and ``potential" magic resources. The former quantifies the magic cost associated with the MQC framework, serving both as a witness of magic resources and an upper bound for the realization of a desired unitary transformation. Potential magic resources represent the maximum achievable magic resource in a given graph structure defining the MQC. We utilize these concepts to analyze the magic resource requirements of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and provide a fresh perspective on the universality of MQC of different resource states, highlighting the crucial role of non-Pauli measurements for injecting magic. We demonstrate experimentally our theoretical predictions in a high-fidelity four-photon setup and demonstrate the efficiency of MQC in generating magic states, surpassing the limitations of conventional magic state injection methods. Our findings pave the way for future research exploring magic resource optimization and novel distillation schemes within the MQC framework, contributing to the advancement of fault-tolerant universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Detecting quasi-degenerate ground states in 1D topological models via VQE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exact ground states of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger open chain and of the Kitaev open chain, using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. These models host symmetry-protected topological phases, characterized by edge modes with vanishing single-particle energy in the thermodynamic limit. The same fact prevents the standard VQE algorithm from converging to the correct ground state for finite chains, since it is quasi-degenerate in energy with other many-body states. Notably, this quasi-degeneracy cannot be removed by small perturbations, as in typical spin systems. We address this issue by imposing appropriate constraints on the VQE evolution and constructing appropriate variational circuits, to restrict the probed portion of the Hilbert space along the same evolution. These constraints stem from both general properties of the topological phases and of the studied Hamiltonians. In this way, the improved VQE algorithm achieves an accurate convergence to the exact ground states in each phase. The present approach promises large applicability, also to realistic systems and possibly with different topology, thanks to the very high fidelity achieved also on systems with a relatively high number of qubits.</description>

Abstract: Semiclassical methods are essential in analyzing quantum mechanical systems. Although they generally produce approximate results, relatively rare potentials exist for which these methods are exact. Such intriguing potentials serve as crucial test cases for semiclassical approximations. Recent research has demonstrated a deep connection between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the exactness of semiclassical methods. Specifically, the mathematical form of conventional shape-invariant potentials guarantees exactness in several related situations. In this manuscript, we review these recent results and discuss their significance.</description>

Abstract: Random spin systems at low temperatures are glassy and feature computational hardness in finding low-energy states. We study the random all-to-all interacting fermionic Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model and prove that, in contrast, (I) the low-energy states have polynomial circuit depth, yet (II) the annealed and quenched free energies agree to inverse-polynomially low temperatures, ruling out a glassy phase transition in this sense. These results are derived by showing that fermionic and spin systems significantly differ in their \emph{commutation index}, which quantifies the non-commutativity of Hamiltonian terms. Our results suggest that low-temperature strongly interacting fermions, unlike spins, belong in a classically nontrivial yet quantumly easy phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new data structure, called \emph{Weighted Context-Free-Language Ordered BDDs} (WCFLOBDDs), which are a hierarchically structured decision diagram, akin to Weighted BDDs (WBDDs) enhanced with a procedure-call mechanism. For some functions, WCFLOBDDs are exponentially more succinct than WBDDs. They are potentially beneficial for representing functions of type $\mathbb{B}^n \rightarrow D$, when a function's image $V \subseteq D$ has many different values. We apply WCFLOBDDs in quantum-circuit simulation, and find that they perform better than WBDDs on certain benchmarks. With a 15-minute timeout, the number of qubits that can be handled by WCFLOBDDs is 1-64$\times$ that of WBDDs (and 1-128$\times$ that of CFLOBDDs, which are an unweighted version of WCFLOBDDs). These results support the conclusion that for this application -- from the standpoint of problem size, measured as the number of qubits -- WCFLOBDDs provide the best of both worlds: performance roughly matches whichever of WBDDs and CFLOBDDs is better. (From the standpoint of running time, the results are more nuanced.)</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat two identical and mutually independent two-level atoms that are coupled to a quantum field as an open quantum system. The master equation that governs their evolution is derived by tracing over the degree of freedom of the field. With this, we compare the entanglement dynamics of the two atoms moving with different trajectories in $\kappa$-deformed and Minkowski spacetimes. Notably, when the environment-induced interatomic interaction does not exist, the entanglement dynamics of two static atoms in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime are reduced to that in Minkowski spacetime in the case that the spacetime deformation parameter $\kappa$ is sufficiently large as theoretically predicted. However, if the atoms undergo relativistic motion, regardless of whether inertial or non-inertial, their entanglement dynamics in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime behave differently from that in Minkowski spacetime even when $\kappa$ is large. We investigate various types of entanglement behavior, such as decay and generation, and discuss how different relativistic motions, such as uniform motion in a straight line and circular motion, amplify the differences in the entanglement dynamics between the $\kappa$-deformed and Minkowski spacetime cases. In addition, when the environment-induced interatomic interaction is considered, we find that it may also enhance the differences in the entanglement dynamics between these two spacetimes. Thus, in principle, one can tell whether she/he is in $\kappa$-deformed or Minkowski spacetime by checking the entanglement behavior between two atoms in certain circumstances.</description>

      <title>Mixed higher-order topology and nodal and nodeless flat band topological phases in a superconducting multiorbital model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases that appear in an orbital version of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) model in the presence of conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and with the possibility of tuning an in-plane magnetic field. We chart out the phase diagram by considering different boundary conditions, with the topology of the individual phases further examined by considering both the Wannier and entanglement spectra, as well as the Majorana polarization.
  For weak to moderate values of magnetic field and superconducting pairing amplitude, we find a second-order topological superconductor phase with eight zero-energy corner modes. Further increasing field or pairing, half of the corner states can be turned into zero-energy edge-localized modes, thus forming a type of hybrid-order phase. Then, we find two different putative first-order topological phases, a nodal and a nodeless phase, both with zero-energy flat bands localized along mirror-symmetric open edges. For the nodal phase, the flat bands are localized between the nodes in reciprocal space, while in the nodeless phase, with its a full bulk gap, the zero-energy boundary flat band spans the whole Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Categorical Quantum Volume Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the quantum volume operator quantifying the volume in curved three-dimensional discrete geometries. In its standard form, the quantum volume operator is constructed from tetrahedra whose faces are endowed with irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Here, we show two equivalent constructions that allow general objects in fusion categories as degrees of freedom. First, we compute the volume operator for ribbon fusion categories. This includes the important class of modular tensor categories (such as quantum doubles), which are the building blocks of anyon models. Second, we further generalize the volume operator to spherical fusion categories by relaxing the categorical analog of the closure constraint (known as tetrahedral symmetry). In both cases, we obtain a volume operator that is Hermitian, provided that the input category is unitary. As an illustrative example, we consider the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ and show that the standard $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ volume operator is recovered in the limit $k\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report reviews recent progress in computing Kubo formulas for general interacting Hamiltonians. The aim is to calculate electric and thermal magneto-conductivities in strong scattering regimes where Boltzmann equation and Hall conductivity proxies exceed their validity. Three primary approaches are explained.
  1. Degeneracy-projected polarization formulas for Hall-type conductivities, which substantially reduce the number of calculated current matrix elements. These expressions generalize the Berry curvature integral formulas to imperfect lattices. 2. Continued fraction representation of dynamical longitudinal conductivities. The calculations produce a set of thermodynamic averages, which can be controllably extrapolated using their mathematical relations to low and high frequency conductivity asymptotics. 3. Hall-type coefficients summation formulas, which are constructed from thermodynamic averages.
  The thermodynamic formulas are derived in the operator Hilbert space formalism, which avoids the opacity and high computational cost of the Hamiltonian eigenspectrum. The coefficients can be obtained by well established imaginary-time Monte Carlo sampling, high temperature expansion, traces of operator products, and variational wavefunctions at low temperatures. We demonstrate the power of approaches 1--3 by their application to well known models of lattice electrons and bosons. The calculations clarify the far-reaching influence of strong local interactions on the metallic transport near Mott insulators. Future directions for these approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of noninteracting electrons, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry; we further generalize the conclusion to interacting systems for the case where there is one atom per unit cell. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures the integrated quantum metric exclusively. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free-fermions, we unveil a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Holographic analysis of boundary correlation functions for the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze boundary spin correlation functions of the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model from the holographic point of view. Using the corner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method, we demonstrate that the boundary correlation function exhibits power-law decay with quasi-periodic oscillation, while the bulk correlation function always decays exponentially. On the basis of the geometric relation between the bulk correlation path and distance along the outer edge boundary, we find that scaling dimensions for the boundary correlation function can be well explained by the combination of the bulk correlation length and background curvatures inherent to the hyperbolic lattice. We also investigate the cutoff effect of the bond dimension in CTMRG, revealing that the long-distance behavior of the boundary spin correlation is accurately described even with a small bond dimension. In contrast, the sort-distance behavior rapidly loses its accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent exotic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>
