      <title>Influence of Uncertainties in Optode Positions on Self-Calibrating or Dual-Slope Diffuse Optical Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-calibrating and dual-slope measurements have been used in the field of diffuse optics for robust assessment of absolute values or temporal changes in the optical properties of highly scattering media and biological tissue. These measurements employ optical probes with a minimum of two source positions and a minimum of two detector positions. This work focuses on a quantitative analysis of the impact of errors in these source and detector positions on the assessment of optical properties. We considered linear, trapezoidal, and rectangular optode arrangements and theoretical computations based on diffusion theory for semi-infinite homogeneous media. We found that uncertainties in optodes' positions may have a greater impact on measurements of absolute scattering versus absorption coefficients. For example, 4.1% and 19% average errors in absolute absorption and scattering, respectively, can be expected by displacing every optode in a linear arrangement by 1 mm in any direction. The impact of optode position errors is typically smaller for measurements of absorption changes. For each geometrical arrangement (linear, trapezoid, rectangular), we identify the direction of the position uncertainty for each optode that has minimal impact on the optical measurements. These results can guide the optimal design of optical probes for self-calibrating and dual-slope measurements.</description>

      <title>Long-distance axial spectral encoding using space-time wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time wave packets (STWPs) are pulsed optical beams whose spatiotemporal structure enables propagation invariance. However, STWPs allow for a unique propagation configuration that we call axial spectral encoding, in which the spectrum on the propagation axis changes with distance. We demonstrate here axial spectral encoding over distances extending for hundreds of meters in an open-field laser range. We verify two distinct configurations: in the first, the on-axis spectrum blue-shifts or red-shifts with propagation distance; and in the second, the spectrum changes at a fixed axial position by altering an internal parameter of the STWP without modifying the wave packet spectrum. These results indicates the potential for using spectral measurements for ranging in LIDAR and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A sub-volt near-IR lithium tantalate electro-optic modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a low-loss integrated electro-optic Mach-Zehnder modulator in thin-film lithium tantalate at 737 nm, featuring a low half-wave voltage-length product of 0.65 V$\cdot$cm, an extinction ratio of 30 dB, low optical loss of 5.3 dB, and a detector-limited bandwidth of 20 GHz. A small $&lt;2$ dB DC bias drift relative to quadrature bias is measured over 16 minutes using 4.3 dBm of on-chip power in ambient conditions, which outperforms the 8 dB measured using a counterpart thin-film lithium niobate modulator. Finally, an optical loss coefficient of 0.5 dB/cm for a thin-film lithium tantalate waveguide is estimated at 638 nm using a fabricated ring resonator.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy-Locked Optical Parametric Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are widely utilized in photonics as classical and quantum light sources. Conventional OPOs produce co-propagating signal and idler waves that can be either degenerately or non-degenerately phase-matched. This configuration, however, makes it challenging to separate signal and idler waves and also renders their frequencies highly sensitive to external disturbances. Here, we demonstrate a degeneracy-locked OPO achieved through backward phase matching in a submicron periodically-poled thin-film lithium niobate microresonator. While the backward phase matching establishes frequency degeneracy of the signal and idler, the backscattering in the waveguide further ensures phase-locking between them. Their interplay permits the locking of the OPO's degeneracy over a broad parameter space, resulting in deterministic degenerate OPO initiation and robust operation against both pump detuning and temperature fluctuations. This work thus provides a new approach for synchronized operations in nonlinear photonics and extends the functionality of optical parametric oscillators. With its potential for large-scale integration, it provides a chip-based platform for advanced applications, such as squeezed light generation, coherent optical computing, and investigations of complex nonlinear phenomena.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Realism in Holographic Augmented Reality Displays through Occlusion Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an occlusion-capable holographic augmented-reality (AR) display is proposed, and its ability to enhance AR imagery through occlusion is demonstrated. Holographic displays can generate ideal three-dimensional (3D) virtual images and have recently shown rapid advancements, particularly in noise reduction through learning-based approaches. However, these displays still face challenges in improving image quality for AR scenarios because holographic virtual images are simply superimposed onto the real world, leading to a loss of contrast and visibility. To address this, an occlusion optics, which can mask designated areas of the real world, is incorporated into holographic AR displays. The proposed system employs a folded 4f system with a digital micromirror device and sequentially operates as both a real-world mask and an active Fourier filter. This approach transforms traditionally translucent holographic images into perceptually opaque ones while simultaneously eliminating unwanted noise terms from pixelated holographic displays. Furthermore, active Fourier filtering expands the virtual image field of view through time-multiplexed operation and supports a novel binary hologram optimization algorithm that performs especially well for sparse virtual content. The implementation successfully achieves opaque holographic 3D image presentation, significantly improving contrast and image quality while producing highly realistic 3D AR scenes with optically cast shadows.</description>

      <title>Bridging Statistical Scattering and Aberration Theory: Ray Deflection Function -- I: Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new conceptual framework that recasts surface roughness effects as a "ray deflection function" (RDF) which can be statistically represented through a modified Zernike-Fourier hybrid approach that directly connects the PSD with statistical aberration coefficients through spectral overlap integration. By establishing a direct mathematical relationship between the power spectral density (PSD) of surface imperfections and the statistical distribution of aberration coefficients, we develop a formalism that bridges known probabilistic scattering theory with deterministic aberration analysis. This transformation allows surface roughness to be seamlessly integrated with other optical aberrations by expressing its effects through equivalent modifications to the ideal mirror shape. This framework provides computational advantages for ray-tracing simulations while maintaining statistical fidelity to established scattering models, particularly for predicting the three-dimensional structure of imperfect focal bodies in optical systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging Statistical Scattering and Aberration Theory: Ray Deflection Function -- II: Numerical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive experimental validation of a recently developed Ray Deflection Function (RDF) approach, which offers a new framework for modeling surface roughness effects in optical systems. Through detailed geometrical ray tracing simulations, we demonstrate that the RDF methodology successfully bridges two traditionally separate domains: statistical scattering models and deterministic aberration analysis. We implement and compare the two approaches for modeling a parabolic mirror with surface imperfections with three cases: (1) an ideal parabolic mirror baseline, (2) the conventional Harvey-Shack (HS) statistical scattering theory applied to ray perturbations, and (3) the newly proposed aberration term method based on the RDF theory. Our results confirm the statistical equivalence between the HS approach and the RDF-based aberration term method, with both producing close near-focal-plane distributions and focal volume characteristics. By establishing this equivalence, we validate that surface roughness effects can be accurately represented as deterministic aberration terms while maintaining fidelity to established statistical scattering models.</description>

      <title>On-demand longitudinal transformations of light beams via an amplitude-phase-decoupled Pancharatnam-Berry phase element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcoming the inherent phase-only modulation limitation of conventional Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) elements, we propose a checkerboard-encoded PB element that enables simultaneous amplitude and phase modulation through PB phase engineering. This single-element platform directly generates polarization-rotating beams with continuously varying polarization angles along the propagation axis, eliminating traditional dynamic phase requirements. By strategically combining the proposed element with a liquid crystal q-plate and waveplates, we demonstrate on-demand longitudinal transformations of polarization states and high-order Poincar\'e sphere beams. Significantly, we achieve, for the first time to our knowledge, the propagation-transformed optical skyrmions, whose topological textures evolve with propagation distance. This amplitude-phase decoupling mechanism and the integration solution for various longitudinal transformations open new avenues in structured light manipulation, particularly benefiting quantum optics and topological photonics applications requiring longitudinal mode control.</description>

      <title>Phase-shifting structured illumination with polarization-encoded metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-shifting structured illumination is a powerful technique used across diverse imaging modalities, including 3D surface measurement, quantitative phase imaging, and super-resolution microscopy. However, conventional implementations often rely on mechanically driven or optoelectronically complex systems, limiting their compactness, stability, and integration. Here, we present a polarization-controlled dielectric metasurface that generates phase-shifting fringe patterns in the visible spectrum, enabling compact and robust structured light projection. The metasurface encodes distinct phase gratings for orthogonal polarizations, producing fringe patterns with relative lateral displacements that vary according to the polarization of the transmitted light. We experimentally demonstrate high-quality fringe generation and apply the structured illumination in a fringe projection profilometry system for 3D surface measurement of different objects. The metasurface integrates multiple phase-shifting steps into a single static device, offering a millimeter-scale footprint and compatibility with polarization multiplexing. This approach introduces a compact, passive solution for structured light generation with broad potential in next-generation optical metrology and advanced computational imaging.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Optical Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various imaging techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to visualize objects embedded within complex media such as biological tissues, fog, atmosphere, or various turbid media. Optical imaging, in particular, offers multiple advantages, including non-invasive capabilities, absence of ionizing radiation, and high contrast for many biological tissues. However, optical imaging through substantially thick scattering media remains challenging due to extensive photon diffusion, significantly restricting reconstruction quality and achievable resolution. To address these limitations, we introduce Diffuse Optical Ptychography (DOP), a novel imaging method inspired by ptychography technique, which exploits additional spatial information gained from multiple overlapping illumination patterns. The primary technical innovation of DOP lies in its effective use of overlapping yet minimally correlated illuminations, significantly enhancing reconstruction accuracy and image quality. Compared to existing optical imaging methods through thick diffusive media, DOP achieves superior resolution (down to 1 mm) and reliably reconstructs both binary and grayscale objects embedded within media thicker than 100 transport mean free paths. Importantly, DOP demonstrates robust reconstruction performance both with accurately calibrated diffusion properties and even without prior calibration. Furthermore, the experimental setup for DOP remains straightforward, utilizing only a conventional camera and scanning illumination spots. Our demonstrations underscore the broad potential impact of DOP in applications ranging from medical diagnostics to non-destructive testing, thus opening promising avenues for high-resolution imaging in highly scattering environments.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of mirror-symmetric disordered systems for broadband perfect transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for achieving broadband perfect wave transmission in complex systems by optimizing symmetric disordered media via inverse design. We show that leveraging symmetry of complex media reduces the optimization's complexity enabling the incorporation of additional constraints in the parameter space. Starting from a single perfectly transmitting state with predefined input and output wavefronts at a specific frequency, we progressively broaden the bandwidth - from a reflectionless exceptional point with a flattened lineshape to narrowband filters and ultimately to broadband quasi-perfect transmission exhibiting a rainbow effect. Numerical simulations based on the coupled dipole approximation are validated experimentally in a multichannel microwave waveguide with dielectric and metallic scatterers. Finally, we demonstrate broadband enhanced wave transmission through barriers highlighting the potential for advanced wave control applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Nonlinear Effects in Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics in photonic integrated circuits is usually limited to utilizing the nonlinearity of a single material. In this work, we demonstrate the use of hybrid optical nonlinearities that occur in two different materials. This approach allows us to observe combined Raman scattering and Kerr frequency comb generation using silicon nitride (Si3N4) microresonators with fused silica cladding. Here, the fused silica cladding provides Raman gain, while the silicon nitride core provides the Kerr nonlinearity for frequency comb generation. This way we can add Raman scattering to an integrated photonic silicon nitride platform, in which Raman scattering has not been observed so far because of insufficient Raman gain. The Raman lasing is observed in the silica-clad silicon nitride resonators at an on-chip optical power of 143 mW, which agrees with theoretical simulations. This can be reduced to mw-level with improved optical quality factor. Broadband Raman-Kerr frequency comb generation is realized through dispersion engineering of the waveguides. The use of hybrid optical nonlinearities in multiple materials opens up new functionalities for integrated photonic devices, e.g. by combining second and third-order nonlinear materials for combined supercontinuum generation and self-referencing of frequency combs. Combining materials with low threshold powers for different nonlinearities can be the key to highly efficient nonlinear photonic circuits for compact laser sources, high-resolution spectroscopy, frequency synthesis in the infrared and UV, telecommunications and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Propagation and circulating modes of reciprocal non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a novel localization phenomenon, in which all bulk states in a non-Hermitian system under certain conditions are localized at the edge of the system. Conventionally, most studies of NHSE have dealt with discrete lattice systems with non-reciprocal couplings. However in recent years, NHSE in a reciprocal two-dimensional continuous medium, such as photonic crystal systems, has also been reported. In particular, we have previously shown that NHSE also occurs in two-dimensional uniform media. In such two-dimensional systems, skin modes propagate in a direction perpendicular to the localization direction, and especially, they have the property of propagating in only one direction. In this paper, we show numerically an intriguing scattering phenomenon: when a scatterer is placed in the path of a skin mode, the scattering causes the skin mode to hop between opposing edges. In addition, we propose a new method of generating circulating modes with orbital angular momentum using this scattering phenomenon. Our work paves the way for new applications of NHSE as micro-sized optical devices manipulating or generating OAM.</description>

      <title>Experimental and on-sky demonstration of spectrally dispersed wavefront sensing using a photonic lantern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optics systems are critical in any application where highly resolved imaging or beam control must be performed through a dynamic medium. Such applications include astronomy and free-space optical communications, where light propagates through the atmosphere, as well as medical microscopy and vision science, where light propagates through biological tissue. Recent works have demonstrated common-path wavefront sensors for adaptive optics using the photonic lantern, a slowly varying waveguide that can efficiently couple multi-moded light into single-mode fibers. We use the SCExAO astrophotonics platform at the 8-m Subaru Telescope to show that spectral dispersion of lantern outputs can improve correction fidelity, culminating with an on-sky demonstration of real-time wavefront control. To our best knowledge, this is the first such result for either a spectrally dispersed or a photonic lantern wavefront sensor. Combined with the benefits offered by lanterns in precision spectroscopy, our results suggest the future possibility of a unified wavefront sensing spectrograph using compact photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Efficient Large-Scale Universal Linear Transformations for Optical Modes in the Synthetic Time Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in photonic information processing has generated strong interest in scalable and dynamically reconfigurable photonic circuitry. Conventional approaches based on spatial interferometer meshes face a fundamental scaling bottleneck, requiring a number of components that grows quadratically with system size. Here, we introduce a hardware-efficient time-domain photonic processor that achieves at least an exponential reduction in component count for implementing arbitrary linear transformations. Our design leverages the favorable scaling properties of the synthetic time dimension by encoding information in time-binned modes and processing them in parallel using recursive switchable short and long-range coupling. The dynamic connectivity of our processor enables systematic pruning of circuit depth, which minimizes optical loss while maintaining all-to-all connectivity. We benchmark our platform on the task of boosted Bell state measurements - a critical component in linear optical quantum computing, and demonstrate that the architecture surpasses the thresholds required for universal cluster-state quantum computation under realistic hardware parameters. We link the performance of our device to the geometric nature of multi-photon transport and show that, contrary to the expectation that redundant faulty hardware degrades performance, localization effects may contribute to improved robustness against coherent errors. Our results establish a practical pathway toward near-term, scalable, and reconfigurable photonic processors for quantum computation and simulation in the synthetic time dimension.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitons in non-magnetic CrCl3</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials, with their unique combination of electronic, optical, and magnetic properties, are emerging as promising platforms for exploring excitonic phenomena. Thus far, the choice of materials with exceptional excitonic response has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) configurations of vdW materials. At the same time, large interlayer distance and the possibility to create a variety of heterostructures offers an opportunity to control the dielectric screening in van der Waals heterostructures and van der Waal 3D materials, thus engineering the excitonic properties. Here, we reveal that bulk vdW crystal CrCl3 answers this quest with a record exciton binding energy of 1.64 eV owing to a delicate interplay of quasi-2D electronic confinement and short-range magnetic correlations. Furthermore, we observe colossal binding energies in vdW crystals NbOCl2 (0.66 eV) and MoCl3 (0.35 eV) and formulate a universal exciton binding energy dependence on bandgap for 2D and 3D vdW materials. Hence, our findings establish a fundamental link between the layered structure of vdW materials and their excitonic properties.</description>

      <title>Large speed-up of quantum emitter detection via extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Our work offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-channel Transfer and Modulation of Optical Vortices in a Ladder-Type System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dual-channel closed-loop structure within a symmetry-broken ladder-type three-level quantum system, where each channel incorporates three-wave mixing (TWM) processes. This system enables the transfer of optical vortices from either the strong control field or the weak input probe field to the TWM-generated fields in the channel. As a result, the two resultant output optical fields exhibit unique spatial distributions, such as crescent and petal shapes, which can be non-synchronously modulated via adjusting the intensity and frequency of the control field. The orbital angular momentum transfer dynamics and multi-angle spatial distribution modulation of the output fields show periodic and non-synchronous characteristics via adjusting the control field due to the optical interference. Thus, this quantum system has great potential as a tunable optical modulator, which holds promise for applications in information technologies involving multi-channel processing and asymmetric tasks, especially in advanced optical modulation and quantum state manipulation in quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional (2D) material, garners interest for hosting bright quantum emitters at room temperature. A great variety of fabrication processes have been proposed with various yields of quantum emitters. In this work, we study the influence of several parameters, such as irradiation energy, annealing environment, and the type of hBN, on the emitter density in hBN. Our results show (i) high emitter density with oxygen irradiation at 204 eV, (ii) post-annealing in carbon-rich atmospheres significantly increases emitter density, reinforcing carbon's potential role, (iii) no significant effect of oxygen pre-annealing, and (iv) a slightly increased emitter density from hBN crystals with lower structural quality. Although the precise origin of the emitters remains unclear, our study shows that oxygen irradiation and subsequent inert annealing in a carbon-rich environment play a crucial role in emitter generation, while the other processing parameters have a smaller influence. As such, our systematic study and findings show relevant advances towards the reproducible formation of visible-frequency quantum emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Collection of fluorescence from an ion using trap-integrated photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneously emitted photons are entangled with the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom of the emitting atom, so interference and measurement of these photons can entangle separate matter-based quantum systems as a resource for quantum information processing. However, the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission hinders the single-mode photonic operations required to generate entanglement. Current demonstrations rely on bulk photon-collection and manipulation optics that suffer from environment-induced phase instability, mode matching challenges, and system-to-system variability, factors that impede scaling to the large numbers of entangled pairs needed for quantum information processing. To address these limitations, we demonstrate a collection method that enables passive phase stability, straightforward photonic manipulation, and intrinsic reproducibility. Specifically, we engineer a waveguide-integrated grating to couple photons emitted from a trapped ion into a single optical mode within a microfabricated ion-trap chip. Using the integrated collection optic, we characterize the collection efficiency, image the ion, and detect the ion's quantum state. This proof-of-principle demonstration lays the foundation for leveraging the inherent stability and reproducibility of integrated photonics to efficiently create, manipulate, and measure multipartite quantum states in arrays of quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic waveguide chip-to-free-space beam scanning at 68 Million Spots/(s$\cdot$mm$^{2}$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seamless chip-to-world photonic interface enables wide-ranging advancements in optical ranging, display, communication, computation, imaging, and light-matter interaction. An optimal solution allows for 2D scanning of a diffraction-limited beam from anywhere on a photonic chip over a large number of beam-spots in free-space. Currently, devices with direct PIC integration rely on tiled apertures with poor mode qualities, large footprints, and complex control systems. Micro-mechanical beam scanners have good beam quality but lack direct PIC integration and are inertially-limited due to the use of bulk optical components or structures in which the optical aperture and actuator sizes are inextricably linked, resulting in trade-offs among resolution, speed, and footprint. Here, we overcome these limitations with the photonic "ski-jump": a nanoscale optical waveguide monolithically integrated atop a piezoelectrically actuated cantilever which passively curls ~90$^{\circ}$ out-of-plane in a footprint of &lt;0.1 mm$^{2}$, emits sub-micron diffraction-limited optical modes, and exhibits kHz-rate mechanical resonances with quality factors exceeding 10,000. This enables two-dimensional beam-scanning with footprint-adjusted spot-rates of 68.6 mega-spots/(s$\cdot$mm$^{2}$) at CMOS-level voltages, which is equivalent to a 1 megapixel display at 100 Hz from a 1.5 mm$^{2}$ footprint, and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art MEMS mirrors by &gt;50$\times$. Using this device, we demonstrate image projection, video projection, and the initialization and readout of single photons from silicon vacancy centers in diamond waveguides. Based on current performance, we identify pathways for achieving &gt;1 giga-spots at kHz-rates in a ~1 cm$^{2}$ area to provide a seamless, scalable optical pipeline between integrated photonic processors and the free-space world.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Inspired Deep Learning Framework with Polar Coordinate Attention for Ptychographic Imaging</title>

Abstract: Ptychographic imaging confronts inherent challenges in applying deep learning for phase retrieval from diffraction patterns. Conventional neural architectures, both convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based methods, are optimized for natural images with Euclidean spatial neighborhood-based inductive biases that exhibit geometric mismatch with the concentric coherent patterns characteristic of diffraction data in reciprocal space. In this paper, we present PPN, a physics-inspired deep learning network with Polar Coordinate Attention (PoCA) for ptychographic imaging, that aligns neural inductive biases with diffraction physics through a dual-branch architecture separating local feature extraction from non-local coherence modeling. It consists of a PoCA mechanism that replaces Euclidean spatial priors with physically consistent radial-angular correlations. PPN outperforms existing end-to-end models, with spectral and spatial analysis confirming its greater preservation of high-frequency details. Notably, PPN maintains robust performance compared to iterative methods even at low overlap ratios, making it well suited for high-throughput imaging in real-world acquisition scenarios for samples with consistent structural characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon G centers show significant promise as single photon sources in a scalable silicon platform. But these color centers have large non-radiative decay and a low Debye-Waller factor, limiting their usability in quantum applications. In this work, we demonstrate bright Purcell-enhanced emission from a silicon G center by coupling it to a nanophotonic cavity. The nanobeam cavity enhances the spontaneous emission rate of a single G center by a factor of 6, corresponding to a Purcell factor greater than 31 when accounting for decay into the phonon sideband. We obtain a spontaneous emission rate of 0.97 ns, which is the fastest single photon emission rate reported in silicon. With this radiative enhancement, we achieve an order of magnitude improvement in emitter brightness compared to previously reported values. These results pave the way for scalable quantum light sources on a silicon photonic chip.</description>

Abstract: Delayed luminescence (DL) is a quantized signal that is characteristic of photoexcited molecules entering a relaxed state. Studying DL provides critical insight into photophysical mechanisms via analysis of specific spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we developed a high-sensitivity DL imaging system using a quantitative scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (qCMOS) camera and a single-photon counting resolution. By optimizing the optical architecture and signal processing algorithms together, we achieved full-field spatiotemporal DL imaging at megapixel resolution (i.e., 2304 $\times$ 4096 pixels). Key findings include the following: (1) we observed spatial heterogeneity in DL intensity across the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, with stronger signals detected in veins and at sites of mechanical injury; (2) species-specific DL responses occurred in response to oxidative stress, with Hydrocotyle vulgaris and Ginkgo biloba showing enhanced central DL activity; (3) Excitation using white light induced maximum DL intensity, while red and blue light differentially modulated decay kinetics. Finally, we develop a two-level quantum model that links DL dynamics to the populations of excited-state electrons, thereby developing a theoretical framework for future photophysical research. Overall, this work may help future studies of plant phenotyping under stress and light environment optimization.</description>

      <title>Generation of photon pairs through spontaneous four-wave mixing in subwavelength nonlinear films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. Despite the success in the demonstration of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, there are almost no works on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) - an alternative process to generate photon pairs. Meanwhile, SFWM can be implemented in any nanostructures, including ones made of isotropic materials, which are easier to fabricate than crystalline SPDC sources. Here, we investigate photon pair generation through SFWM in subwavelength films of amorphous silicon nitride (SiN) with varying nitrogen content. For all samples, we demonstrate two-photon quantum correlations, indicated by the normalized second-order correlation function g(2)(0): it exceeds 2 and decays as the pump power increases. By observing two-photon interference between SFWM from the SiN films and the fused silica substrate, we find the third-order susceptibilities of films with different nitrogen content.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of Directional Couplers with Oxide Cladding: Bridging Simulation and Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directional couplers are a fundamental building block in integrated photonics, particularly in quantum applications and optimization-based design where precision is critical. Accurate functionality is crucial to ensure reliable operation within classical and quantum circuits. However, discrepancies between simulations and measurements are frequently observed. These inaccuracies can compromise the performance and scalability of integrated photonic systems, underscoring the critical need for advanced, precise simulation methods that bridge the gap between design and implementation. In this work, we show that this discrepancy can be mainly attributed to density changes in the oxide cladding. We conduct a systematic study involving experimental optical measurements, numerical simulations, and direct electron microscopy imaging to investigate this discrepancy in directional couplers. We find that the impact of cladding density variations on performance increases as feature gaps shrink. By incorporating these effects into our simulations using a novel and physically motivated Effective Trench Medium Model (ETMM), we achieve highly accurate reproduction of experimental measurements. We quantify the effects of cladding density variations on the SU(2) symmetry parameters that govern light propagation in directional couplers. This insight is crucial for advancing the precision of compact device fabrication, enabling reliable simulation of photonic integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Flatband Dispersion in Bilayer Moir\'e Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally investigate the photonic dispersion in one-dimensional moir\'e structures formed by stacking two photonic crystal slabs with slightly different periods, separated by a carefully controlled subwavelength optical spacer. Angle-resolved reflectivity measurements reveal moir\'e bands arising from the interplay between intra- and inter-layer coupling mechanisms of guided modes mediated by the moir\'e superlattice corrugation. By precisely adjusting the refractive index contrast through the filling factor of the photonic crystals, we continuously tune intralayer coupling while keeping interlayer coupling constant. Consequently, we experimentally demonstrate the evolution of moir\'e minibands into flatbands characterized by minimal dispersion bandwidth. All experimental results show good agreement with numerical simulations. Our findings not only confirm theoretical predictions but also provide a practical approach for realizing photonic flatbands in silicon-based moir\'e superlattices operating in the telecom wavelength range. This work paves the way toward harnessing flatband physics in advanced optoelectronic applications such as lasers and optical sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical theory asserts that several electromagnetic waves cannot interact with matter if they interfere destructively to zero, whereas quantum mechanics predicts a nontrivial light-matter dynamics even when the average electric field vanishes. Here we show that in quantum optics classical interference emerges from collective bright and dark states of light, \textit{i.e.}, entangled superpositions of multi-mode photon-number states. This makes it possible to explain wave interference using the particle description of light and the superposition principle for linear systems.</description>

Using an exact master equation description which accounts for delay effects, we obtain evidence to suggest that competition between collective decay and retardation leads to the emergence of an effective maximum number of atoms able to contribute to the superradiant dynamics, resulting in a plateau of the peak emission rate. To develop this analysis further, we investigate the inter-atomic correlations to find features consistent with the formation of individual superradiant domains. Moreover, we find that retardation can also result in persistent oscillatory atomic dynamics accompanied by a periodic sequence of emission bursts.</description>
