      <title>Dislocation-based crystal plasticity simulation on grain-size dependence of mechanical properties in dual-phase steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the effect of ferrite grain size on the mechanical properties and dislocation behavior of dual-phase (DP) steel is investigated using dislocation-based crystal plasticity finite element analysis. DP steel, composed of a soft ferritic phase and a hard martensitic phase, shows mechanical properties that are significantly influenced by ferrite grain size. The mechanism underlying this grain size effect is clarified by analyzing the partitioning and distribution of stress, strain, and dislocations in each phase. Three models with the same volume fraction of martensitic phase but different ferrite grain sizes are subjected to tensile loading. Interestingly, even though only the ferrite grain size is changed, the stress in the martensitic phase exhibited a notable dependence on ferrite grain size. This can be explained as follows. Geometrically necessary (GN) dislocations accumulate on the ferrite side of the ferrite-martensite grain boundary, and the grain boundary occupancy per unit area increases as the ferrite grain size decreases. As a result, smaller ferrite grain sizes make the ferritic phase less deformable owing to the effect of GN dislocations, shifting more deformation to the martensitic phase. This behavior is confirmed by the more uniform strain distribution and partitioning observed with decreasing ferrite grain size. As the martensitic phase takes on greater deformation, the statistically stored dislocation density in the martensitic phase becomes ferrite grain size dependent, which in turn leads to the observed grain size dependence of stress in the martensitic phase.</description>

      <title>Design of Piezoelectric Metastructures with Multi-Patch Isogeometric Analysis for Enhanced Energy Harvesting and Vibration Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastructures are engineered systems composed of periodic arrays of identical components, called resonators, designed to achieve specific dynamic effects, such as creating a band gap-a frequency range where waves cannot propagate through the structure. When equipped with patches of piezoelectric material, these metastructures exhibit an additional capability: they can harvest energy effectively even from frequencies much lower than the fundamental frequency of an individual resonator. This energy harvesting capability is particularly valuable for applications where low-frequency vibrations dominate. To support the design of metastructures for dual purposes, such as energy harvesting and vibration suppression (reducing unwanted oscillations in the structure), we develop a multi-patch isogeometric model of a piezoelectric energy harvester. This model is based on a piezoelectric Kirchhoff-Love plate-a thin, flexible structure with embedded piezoelectric patches-and uses Nitsche's method to enforce compatibility conditions in terms of displacement, rotations, shear force, and bending moments across the boundaries of different patches. The model is validated against experimental and numerical data from the literature. We then present a novel, parameterized metastructure plate design and conduct a parametric study to explore how resonator geometries affect key performance metrics, including the location and width of the band gap and the position of the first peak in the voltage frequency response function. This model can be integrated with optimization algorithms to maximize outcomes such as energy harvesting efficiency or vibration reduction, depending on application needs.</description>

      <title>Evolving Algebraic Multigrid Methods Using Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigrid methods despite being known to be asymptotically optimal algorithms, depend on the careful selection of their individual components for efficiency. Also, they are mostly restricted to standard cycle types like V-, F-, and W-cycles. We use grammar rules to generate arbitrary-shaped cycles, wherein the smoothers and their relaxation weights are chosen independently at each step within the cycle. We call this a flexible multigrid cycle. These flexible cycles are used in Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods with the help of grammar rules and optimized using genetic programming. The flexible AMG methods are implemented in the software library of hypre, and the programs are optimized separately for two cases: a standalone AMG solver for a 3D anisotropic problem and an AMG preconditioner with conjugate gradient for a multiphysics code. We observe that the optimized flexible cycles provide higher efficiency and better performance than the standard cycle types.</description>

      <title>PyPOD-GP: Using PyTorch for Accelerated Chip-Level Thermal Simulation of the GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising demand for high-performance computing (HPC) has made full-chip dynamic thermal simulation in many-core GPUs critical for optimizing performance and extending device lifespans. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with Galerkin projection (GP) has shown to offer high accuracy and massive runtime improvements over direct numerical simulation (DNS). However, previous implementations of POD-GP use MPI-based libraries like PETSc and FEniCS and face significant runtime bottlenecks. We propose a $\textbf{Py}$Torch-based $\textbf{POD-GP}$ library (PyPOD-GP), a GPU-optimized library for chip-level thermal simulation. PyPOD-GP achieves over $23.4\times$ speedup in training and over $10\times$ speedup in inference on a GPU with over 13,000 cores, with just $1.2\%$ error over the device layer.</description>

      <title>Fourier-enhanced reduced-order surrogate modeling for uncertainty quantification in electric machine design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a data-driven surrogate modeling framework for cost-effectively inferring the torque of a permanent magnet synchronous machine under geometric design variations. The framework is separated into a reduced-order modeling and an inference part. Given a dataset of torque signals, each corresponding to a different set of design parameters, torque dimension is first reduced by post-processing a discrete Fourier transform and keeping a reduced number of frequency components. This allows to take advantage of torque periodicity and preserve physical information contained in the frequency components. Next, a response surface model is computed by means of machine learning regression, which maps the design parameters to the reduced frequency components. The response surface models of choice are polynomial chaos expansions, feedforward neural networks, and Gaussian processes. Torque inference is performed by evaluating the response surface model for new design parameters and then inverting the dimension reduction. Numerical results show that the resulting surrogate models lead to sufficiently accurate torque predictions for previously unseen design configurations. The framework is found to be significantly advantageous compared to approximating the original (not reduced) torque signal directly, as well as slightly advantageous compared to using principal component analysis for dimension reduction. The combination of discrete Fourier transform-based dimension reduction with Gaussian process-based response surfaces yields the best-in-class surrogate model for this use case. The surrogate models replace the original, high-fidelity model in Monte Carlo-based uncertainty quantification studies, where they provide accurate torque statistics estimates at significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Democratize Access to Costly Financial Datasets for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</description>

      <title>Collaborative and parametric insurance on the Ethereum blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to both surplus providers and policyholders. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Based Deep Learning for Time-Efficient Inverse Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate understanding of muscle activation and muscle forces plays an essential role in neuro-rehabilitation and musculoskeletal disorder treatments. Computational musculoskeletal modeling has been widely used as a powerful non-invasive tool to estimate them through inverse dynamics using static optimization, but the inherent computational complexity results in time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results have shown that the selected BiGRU architecture outperforms other neural network models when trained using our specifically designed loss function, which illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>AI-powered Digital Twin of the Ocean: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Real-time Wave Height Prediction with Deep Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental pollution and the depletion of fossil fuels have prompted the need for eco-friendly power generation methods based on renewable energy. However, renewable energy sources often face challenges in providing stable power due to low energy density and non-stationary. Wave energy converters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height prediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can lead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we propose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model, aiming both high predictive accuracy and reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ). The proposed architecture LSTM-DE, integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with deep ensemble (DE) for robust UQ, achieving accuracy and reliability in wave height prediction. To further enhance the reliability of the predictive models, uncertainty calibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality of the quantified uncertainty. Based on the real operational data obtained from an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, we demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-DE model architecture achieves notable predictive accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.9) while increasing the uncertainty quality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model hyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational scenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period. The findings show that the proposed method provides robust and reliable real-time wave height predictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.</description>

      <title>STONet: A novel neural operator for modeling solute transport in micro-cracked reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel neural operator, the Solute Transport Operator Network (STONet), to efficiently model contaminant transport in micro-cracked reservoirs. The model combines different networks to encode heterogeneous properties effectively. By predicting the concentration rate, we are able to accurately model the transport process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our neural operator approach achieves accuracy comparable to that of the finite element method. The previously introduced Enriched DeepONet architecture has been revised, motivated by the architecture of the popular multi-head attention of transformers, to improve its performance without increasing the compute cost. The computational efficiency of the proposed model enables rapid and accurate predictions of solute transport, facilitating the optimization of reservoir management strategies and the assessment of environmental impacts. The data and code for the paper will be published at https://github.com/ehsanhaghighat/STONet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a review of recent publications and working papers on ChatGPT and related Large Language Models (LLMs) in accounting and finance. The aim is to understand the current state of research in these two areas and identify potential research opportunities for future inquiry. We identify three common themes from these earlier studies. The first theme focuses on applications of ChatGPT and LLMs in various fields of accounting and finance. The second theme utilizes ChatGPT and LLMs as a new research tool by leveraging their capabilities such as classification, summarization, and text generation. The third theme investigates implications of LLM adoption for accounting and finance professionals, as well as for various organizations and sectors. While these earlier studies provide valuable insights, they leave many important questions unanswered or partially addressed. We propose venues for further exploration and provide technical guidance for researchers seeking to employ ChatGPT and related LLMs as a tool for their research.</description>

      <title>Efficiency and scalability of fully-resolved fluid-particle simulations on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current supercomputers often have a heterogeneous architecture using both CPUs and GPUs. At the same time, numerical simulation tasks frequently involve multiphysics scenarios whose components run on different hardware due to multiple reasons, e.g., architectural requirements, pragmatism, etc. This leads naturally to a software design where different simulation modules are mapped to different subsystems of the heterogeneous architecture. We present a detailed performance analysis for such a hybrid four-way coupled simulation of a fully resolved particle-laden flow. The Eulerian representation of the flow utilizes GPUs, while the Lagrangian model for the particles runs on CPUs. First, a roofline model is employed to predict the node level performance and to show that the lattice-Boltzmann-based fluid simulation reaches very good performance on a single GPU. Furthermore, the GPU-GPU communication for a large-scale flow simulation results in only moderate slowdowns due to the efficiency of the CUDA-aware MPI communication, combined with communication hiding techniques. On 1024 A100 GPUs, a parallel efficiency of up to 71% is achieved. While the flow simulation has good performance characteristics, the integration of the stiff Lagrangian particle system requires frequent CPU-CPU communications that can become a bottleneck. Additionally, special attention is paid to the CPU-GPU communication overhead since this is essential for coupling the particles to the flow simulation. However, thanks to our problem-aware co-partitioning, the CPU-GPU communication overhead is found to be negligible. As a lesson learned from this development, four criteria are postulated that a hybrid implementation must meet for the efficient use of heterogeneous supercomputers. Additionally, an a priori estimate of the speedup for hybrid implementations is suggested.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Manufacturing: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineering design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs across a spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Specifically in this paper, we assess the capabilities of two VLMs, GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.6 34B, in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, manufacturability assessment, and engineering textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore VLMs' proficiency in handling complex design challenges but also identify their limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</description>
