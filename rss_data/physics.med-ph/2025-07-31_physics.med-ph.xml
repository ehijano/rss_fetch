      <title>Viscoelastic Profiling of Rare Pediatric Extracranial Tumors using Multifrequency MR Elastography: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a noninvasive technique for assessing the viscoelastic properties of soft biological tissues in vivo, with potential relevance for pediatric tumor evaluation. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of multifrequency MRE in children with solid tumors and to report initial findings on stiffness and fluidity across rare pediatric tumor entities. Additionally, the potential of viscoelastic properties as biomarkers of tumor malignancy was explored. Materials and Methods: Ten pediatric patients (mean age, 5.7 +/- 4.8 years; four female) with extracranial solid tumors underwent multifrequency MRE. Shear waves at 30 - 70 Hz were subsequently generated and measured with a phase-sensitive single-shot spin-echo planar imaging sequence. The obtained shear wave fields were processed by wavenumber (k-)based multi-frequency inversion to reconstruct tumor stiffness and fluidity. The viscoelastic properties within the tumors were quantified and correlated with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). In addition, differences in stiffness and fluidity were assessed across the histopathologically confirmed tumor entities, which were stratified into malignancy-based groups. Results: MRE was successfully performed in all patients in under five minutes. Differences in viscoelastic properties were observed among tumor entities: Stiffness, fluidity, and their spatial variability increased significantly with tumor malignancy. Furthermore, a significant inverse correlation was observed between stiffness and tumor ADC values. Conclusion: Multifrequency MRE was feasible in pediatric MRI and provided insight into tumor biomechanics. Preliminary data revealed differences in stiffness and fluidity across pediatric solid tumors correlating with malignancy. MRE holds promise for diagnosis and classification of pediatric tumor entities and their malignancy.</description>

      <title>Carotid Plaque Segmentation in Ultrasound Images Using a Mask R-CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Ultrasound imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnosing carotid atherosclerosis, a significant precursor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and events. This non-invasive modality provides real-time, high-resolution images, allowing clinicians to assess atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries without invasive procedures. Purpose: In this study, we present the refinement of a Mask R-CNN model initially designed for carotid lumen detection to automatically generate bounding boxes enclosing atherosclerotic plaque for segmentation to assist in our ultrasound elastography workflow. Methods: We utilize a PyTorch torchvision implementation of the Mask R-CNN for carotid plaque detection. Our dataset consists of 118 severe stenotic carotid plaques from presenting patients, clinically indicated for a carotid endarterectomy. Due to the variability of plaque presentation in the dataset, a multitude of different R-CNN models were observed to have varying results based on the allowed number of prediction regions. An overview analysis looking at shared predictions from these models showed a slight improvement compared to the individual model results Results: Evaluation metrics such as Dice similarity coefficient and intersection over Union are employed. The model trained with 5 maximum prediction regions and tested with 2 maximum prediction regions produced the highest individual accuracy with a Dice score of 0.74 and intersection over union of 0.61. A filtered combined analysis of all the models demonstrated a slight increase in performance with scores of 0.76 and 0.61 respectively. Conclusion: Due to the significant variation in plaque presentation and types amongst presenting patients, the accuracy of the Plaque Mask R-CNN network would benefit from the incorporation of additional patient datasets to incorporate increased variation into the training dataset.</description>

      <title>Biomimetic Engineering of a Fortified Ice Composite with Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents BioPykrete, a new sustainable bio-composite material created from ice, nano-crystalline cellulose (CNC), and a tailor-made chimera protein designed to bind the two together. We developed and produced the chimera protein by linking AFPIII, an ice-binding protein, with CBM3a, a CNC-binding protein. As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize into a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural enhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete to avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead, it exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for construction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable with concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to construction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where traditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering chimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may help improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing efficiency in paediatric brain tumour segmentation using a pathologically diverse single-center clinical dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children, encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG, medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT), T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2 alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Multi-Component Flow in the Kidney with Multi-b-value Spectral Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Examine the theory and potential clinical application of estimated intravoxel flow of separated perfusion, tubular flow, and diffusion from multi-b-value DWI in kidney allografts. Methods: Multi-b-value DWI (9 b-values; 0-800 s/mm2) from a kidney cortex is simulated with anisotropic and non-Gaussian (i.e. anomalous) vascular, tubular, and tissue components and analyzed with a Bayesian biexponential, least-squares triexponential, and spectral diffusion MRI. Comparison and application of biexponential, triexponential, and spectral diffusion fD is demonstrated in a two-center study of 54 kidney allografts patients (21F/33M, 48.8 SD 10.5years) and compared to fibrosis (Banff 2017 interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy score 0-6 from clinical biopsies of the renal cortex), impaired kidney function (CKD-EPI 2021 eGFR&lt;45ml/min/1.73m2), and proteinuria. Results: Spectral diffusion fD demonstrated strong correlation to input fD of the simulated anisotropic and anomalous components. It agreed with both three-component diffusion and two-component diffusion. fD showed similar or improved agreement and correlation to input compared to individual parameters, and similar or improved agreement to corresponding bi- and triexponential models. In kidney allografts, spectral diffusion fD showed higher allograft fibrosis score had higher fD_tissue, impaired allograft function showed reduced fD_tubule, and fD_vascular negatively correlated with proteinuria across diagnostic groups of function and fibrosis. Conclusions: Spectral diffusion MRI with multi-Gaussian fD as a flow proxy separated different anomalous and anisotropic diffusion components of perfusion, tubular flow, and tissue diffusion and may hold clinical value in diffusion MRI of kidney pathophysiology.</description>

      <title>Imaging simulation of a dual-panel PET geometry with ultrafast TOF detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), time-of-flight (TOF) information localizes source positions along lines of response. Cherenkov-radiator-integrated microchannel-plate photomultiplier tubes have achieved 30 ps TOF resolution, demonstrating cross-sectional imaging without reconstruction. Such ultrafast TOF detectors would free PET from conventional ring geometries. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating imaging characteristics of a dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors using Geant4 simulation. Two detector panels ($137 \times 137~\text{mm}^2$), which consisted of 5.0 mm-thick bismuth germanate pixelized crystals with a 5.75 mm pitch, were placed face-to-face at a 300 mm distance. Imaging characteristics with various TOF resolutions from 30 to 90 ps were evaluated. Because degraded efficiency may cancel TOF gain in image quality, detection efficiency was also parameterized by reducing coincidence counts. Data acquisitions for a numerical multi-rod and uniform phantom (21 MBq) and a modified NEMA NU2 image quality phantom were simulated for 600 s. Results of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction were compared with those of a backprojection (i.e., no reconstruction). The dual-panel PET required a 40 ps TOF resolution to have a similar spatial resolution to that of a non-TOF ring PET (300 mm in diameter) for the same detection efficiency. TOF showed benefit in the reconstruction of image quality phantom with 40% efficiency, and the image noise with 20% efficiency at 30 ps TOF was similar to the complete efficiency at 40 ps TOF. MLEM provided better imaging performance than backprojection, even at 30 ps TOF. The feasibility of the proposed dual-panel PET was shown.</description>

      <title>Whole body dynamic PET kernel reconstruction using nonnegative matrix factorization features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kernel reconstruction is a method that reduces noise in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) by exploiting spatial correlations in the PET image. Although this method works well for large anatomical regions with relatively slow kinetics, whole body PET reconstruction with the kernel method can produce suboptimal results in regions with fast kinetics and high contrast. In this work we propose a new design of the spatial kernel matrix to improve reconstruction in fast and slow kinetics body regions. We calculate voxels features using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with optimal rank selection. These features are then used to calculate similarities between voxels considering relative differences between features to adapt to a wide range of activity levels. Simulations and whole body mouse scans of high temporal resolution [18F]SynVesT-1, low dose [11C]raclopride, and [18F]Fallypride were performed to assess the performance of the method in different settings. In simulations, bias vs variance tradeoff and contrast was improved using the NMF kernel matrix, compared with the original kernel method. In real data, fast kinetic regions such as the heart, veins and kidneys presented oversmoothing or artifacts with the original kernel method. Our proposed method did not present these effects, while reducing noise. Brain kinetic modeling parametric maps with image derived input function ([18F]SynVesT-1) and with reference region ([11C]raclopride and [18F]Fallypride) also had lower standard error using the proposed kernel matrix compared with other methods. The NMF kernel reconstruction reduces noise and maintains high contrast in whole body PET imaging, outperforming the traditional kernel method.</description>

      <title>PolyPose: Localizing Deformable Anatomy in 3D from Sparse 2D X-ray Images using Polyrigid Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.</description>
