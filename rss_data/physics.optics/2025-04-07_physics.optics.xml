      <title>Thermal Lensing Effects in Two-Photon Light-Sheet Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), the axial resolution is governed by the illumination beam profile, motivating the development of advanced beam-shaping techniques to enhance imaging performance. Two-photon LSFM (2P-LSFM), in particular, improves the signal-to-background ratio by reducing laser scattering and distortion in biological specimens. However, we report a potentially detrimental thermal effect in 2P-LSFM: the high laser powers required for two-photon excitation induce localized heating, which alters the refractive index of the medium and effectively forms a divergent thermal lens in water. At 500 mW the light-sheet waist broadens by 25% and shifts by 300 $\mu$m before stabilizing several seconds after the laser shutter is opened. Both experiments and simulations reveal that this thermal lensing effect scales with laser power and the path length the beam travels through water. The resulting degradation in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio may compromise imaging applications that require high laser powers for rapid volumetric imaging of large specimens or functional brain imaging. This limitation is particularly critical in dynamic sample environments, such as during stepwise repositioning or flow-based delivery of chemical or hydrodynamic sensory stimuli, where changes occur on timescales comparable to the thermal settling time.</description>

      <title>Effective Mode Description for Macroscopic Fabry P\'{e}rot Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an effective modes formalism to describe how the quasi-continuum of photonic modes in an optical cavity effectively behaves in the strong light-matter coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. By expressing these effective modes, we are able to solve current mysteries in the field, leveraging the formalism and intuition gained in this framework. Furthermore, we show that the mode volumes of these effective modes are independent of the physical area of the Fabry-P\'erot cavity mirrors. These results also allow us to explain the recently discovered experimental phenomenon in vibrational polaritons, where chemical reactivities can only be modified if the molecules are coupled in resonance to the normal-incidence mode in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity.</description>

      <title>High-resolution and ultra-low power nonlinear image processing with passive high-quality factor metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image processing is both one of the most exciting domains for applying artificial intelligence and the most computationally expensive. Nanostructured metasurfaces have opened the door to the ultimate energy saving by directly processing ambient image data via ultra-thin layers before detection. However, a key ingredient of universal computation - nonlinear thresholding functions - have yet to be demonstrated for low intensities without an external power source. Here, we present a passive, all-optical method for nonlinear image processing using Silicon nanoantenna arrays. We experimentally demonstrate an intensity thresholding filter capable of processing one-dimensional images with only Watt-level power. By leveraging the opto-thermal Kerr nonlinearity through high-Q guided mode resonance, we achieve an experimental threshold as low as 0.1 mW/{\mu}m^2 with a spatial resolution of 1.85 {\mu}m. Additional simulations indicate that the threshold can be further reduced while maintaining high spatial selectivity. Analog, pixel-wise, smoothed leaky ReLU activation filters promise to revolutionize image sensing.</description>

      <title>Inferring scattering-type Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscopy Data from Atomic Force Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical nanoscopy is crucial in life and materials sciences, revealing subtle cellular processes and nanomaterial properties. Scattering-type Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy (s-SNOM) provides nanoscale resolution, relying on the interactions taking place between a laser beam, a sharp tip and the sample. The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is a fundamental part of an s-SNOM system, providing the necessary probe-sample feedback mechanisms for data acquisition. In this Letter, we demonstrate that s-SNOM data can be partially inferred from AFM images. We first show that a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model (pix2pix) can generate synthetic s-SNOM data from experimental AFM images. Second, we demonstrate that virtual s-SNOM data can be extrapolated from knowledge of the tip position and, consequently, from AFM signals. To this end, we introduce an analytical model that explains the mechanisms underlying AFM-to-s-SNOM image translation. These insights have the potential to be integrated into future physics-informed explainable AI models. The two proposed approaches generate pseudo s-SNOM data without direct optical measurements, significantly expanding access to optical nanoscopy through widely available AFM systems. This advancement holds great promise for reducing both time and costs associated with nanoscale imaging.</description>

      <title>Dispersion-Engineered Compact Twisted Metasurfaces Enabling 3D Frequency-Reconfigurable Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible dispersion manipulation is critical for holography to achieve broadband imaging or frequency division multiplexing. Within this context, metasurface-based holography offers advanced dispersion control, yet dynamic reconfigurability remains largely unexplored. This work develops a dispersion-engineered inverse design framework that enables 3D frequency-reconfigurable holography through a twisted metasurface system. The physical implementation is based on a compact layered configuration that cascades the broadband radiation-type metasurface (RA-M) and phase-only metasurface (P-M). The RA-M provides a phase-adjustable input to excite P-M, while the rotation of P-M creates a reconfigurable response of holograms. By employing the proposed scheme, dynamic switching of frequency-space multiplexing and achromatic holograms are designed and experimentally demonstrated in the microwave region. This method advances flexible dispersion engineering for metasurface-based holography, and the compact system holds significant potential for applications in ultra-broadband imaging, high-capacity optical display, and switchable meta-devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian optical scattering in cold atoms via four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear effects could play a crucial role in addressing optical nonreciprocal behaviors in scattering media. Such behaviors are, however, typically observed within a single transmission channel and predominantly in media with fixed optical structures, which inherently restrict the tunability of a nonreciprocal response. We suggest to combine the (intrinsic) nonlinearities of a coherent multi-level medium with a tailored driving geometry that relies on two phase-mismatched standing-wave (SW) beams. This combination is essential for creating extra scattering channels over which, in addition, fully tunable optical nonreciprocal reflection can be attained. Our general approach is here adapted to four-level double-$\Lambda$ atoms that are found to exhibit distinct forms of nonreciprocal multi-channel scattering and quite sensitive to easily tunable parameters of two SW driving beams. The numerical results we present offer valuable insights into the field of non-Hermitian optical scattering and arise indeed from the interplay of interference among scattering processes and Bragg reflection.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Encoded Modulation for High-Fidelity Diffuse Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) offers valuable insights into scattering mediums, but the quest for high-resolution imaging often requires dense sampling strategies, leading to higher imaging errors and lengthy acquisition times. This work introduces Space-Time Encoded Modulation (STEM), a novel light modulation scheme enabling low-noise, high-resolution imaging with single-pixel detectors. In STEM, a laser illuminates the sample, and the transmitted light is detected using a single pixel detector. The detected image is partitioned into a two-dimensional array of sub-images, each encoded with a unique quasi-orthogonal code. These coded sub-images represent light transmission at specific locations along the sample boundary. A single-pixel detector then measures their combined transmission. By virtue of their quasi-orthogonality, the relative strength of each sub-image can be measured, enabling image formation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive mathematical description and experimental validation of the STEM method. Compared to traditional raster scanning, STEM significantly enhances imaging quality, reducing imaging errors by up to 60% and yielding a 3.5-fold increase in reconstruction contrast.</description>

      <title>Silicon nanoantennas for tailoring the optical properties of MoS2 monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-based dielectric nanoantennas provide an effective platform for engineering light-matter interactions in van der Waals semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate near-field coupling between monolayer MoS2 and silicon nanoantennas arranged in hexagonal lattices with tunable geometric parameters, leading to a three-fold enhancement in photoluminescence and an excitation-wavelength-dependent emission that aligns with Mie-resonant modes. Raman spectroscopy reveals an up to 8-fold enhancement in the vibrational modes of MoS2, while second-harmonic generation exhibits a 20 to 30-fold increase in efficiency, closely correlating with the presence of the underlying nanoantennas. Our experiments and simulations quantify the tunable benefits of the near-field interactions, taking into account thin-film interference and strain-induced effects. Our findings present dielectric nanoantennas as a promising platform for tailoring linear and nonlinear optical properties in 2D materials, with potential applications in nanophotonic devices and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>On-chip integrated light sources with MoS2/WSe2 moir\'e superlattices at telecom wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip integrated light sources are essential for photonic integrated circuits, requiring waveguides to interface various components, from light sources to detectors. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures offer exceptional tunability and direct bandgaps, opening new avenues for on-chip light sources. However, a waveguide-integrated light source based on 2D materials operating in the telecom windows has yet to be realized. In this work, we demonstrate that the creation of a moir\'e superlattice enables light emission in the optical fiber communication (OFC) O-band (1260-1360 nm) with brightness surpassing that of intralayer excitons in monolayer MoTe2. Furthermore, we realize waveguide-integrated light sources emitting in the O-band by integrating these superlattices with asymmetric nanobeam cavities. This cavity design not only significantly enhances light emission but also improves the spectral purity of the single cavity mode. Moreover, the device output remains remarkably stable across varying pump power in an ambient environment, demonstrating excellent operational stability. The device performance remains unchanged over a nine-month measurement period, highlighting its long-term stability. This work presents a new architecture for on-chip light sources, advancing practical photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Nonlinear Response of Complex Molecules: Nature and Measurements in the THz Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear optical response of materials under high-intensity electromagnetic fields is key to advancing THz optical technologies. This study introduces a theoretical approach to estimate the nonlinear refractive index coefficient n2 of complex molecules by summing contributions from individual vibrational bonds, which are extracted from structurally simpler molecules predominantly consist of corresponding type of bond. Using water, alpha-pinene, and CO2 as reference materials, we predict n2 for isopropanol as 4.7*10^(-9) cm^2/W. Z-scan measurements with pulsed THz radiation yield n2 = (2.5+-0.5)*10^(-9) cm^2/W, validating our model. This bond-based decomposition links microscopic bond vibrations and macroscopic nonlinear coefficients, offering a framework for understanding molecular nonlinear optics and guiding the design of THz nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Microscopy of Semiconductor Metal-Nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use second and third harmonic generation microscopy to investigate the nonlinear optical response of GaAs nanocavities embedded in a gold film and compare them to bare GaAs nanocavities. Our results reveal that the surrounding metallic environment significantly modifies both the intensity and spatial distribution of the nonlinear signals. When the harmonic wavelength is spectrally detuned from the nanocavity resonance, the effects due to the metallic environment start suppressing the SHG contrast. Numerical simulations confirm that at a 1060 nm pump wavelength, the SHG produced at 530 nm is suppressed due to the dominant plasmonic response of gold. Meanwhile, the THG produced at 353 nm, which coincides with the nanocavity resonance, enables high contrast imaging. Furthermore, by shifting the pump to 710 nm, aligning SHG at 356 nm with the nanocavity resonance, we recover strong SHG contrast, demonstrating a pathway to enhanced imaging of metal-semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic homogenization of particulate composite materials comprising spheroids and truncated spheroids with orientational distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementations of the Bruggeman and Maxwell Garnett homogenization formalisms were developed to estimate the relative permittivity dyadic of a homogenized composite material (HCM), namely $\underline{\underline{\epsilon}}^{\rm HCM}$, arising from randomly distributed mixtures of electrically-small particles with spheroidal shapes and truncated spheroidal shapes. The two/three-dimensional (2D/3D) orientational distributions of the component particles were specified by a Gaussian probability density function. Numerical investigations were undertaken to explore the relationship between the anisotropy of the HCM and the standard deviation of the orientational distribution. For 2D distributions of orientation, $\underline{\underline{\epsilon}}^{\rm HCM}$ is generally biaxial but it becomes uniaxial when the standard deviation approaches zero or exceeds 3. For 3D distributions of orientation, $\underline{\underline{\epsilon}}^{\rm HCM}$ is generally uniaxial; however, it becomes isotropic when the standard deviation exceeds unity, with greater degrees of HCM anisotropy arising at smaller values of standard deviation. The estimates of $\underline{\underline{\epsilon}}^{\rm HCM}$ delivered by the Bruggeman formalism and the Maxwell Garnett formalism are in broad agreement, over much of the volume-fraction range appropriate to the Maxwell Garnett formalism, but the degree of HCM anisotropy predicted by the Maxwell Garnett formalism is generally a little higher than that predicted by the Bruggeman formalism, especially at low values of standard deviation.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion in non-Hermitian photonic graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have numerous potential applications, but the means used for their generation often lack crucial on-demand control. In this work, we present a mechanism of converting spin angular momentum (SAM) to OAM in a non-structured beam. The conversion occurs through spin-orbit coupling in a reconfigurable photonic honeycomb lattice with staggering implemented by electromagnetically-induced transparency in an atomic vapor cell. The spin-orbit coupling allows to outcouple the OAM signal from a particular band in a given valley determined by the chirality of light or the lattice staggering, providing a non-zero Berry curvature for generating OAM. The dependence of the output OAM on the chirality of the input beam is the first control knob. The staggering works as a second control knob, flipping the sign of OAM for the fixed chirality. The demonstrated conversion between SAM and OAM is important for optical communications. Our results can be extended to other implementations of paraxial photonic graphene.</description>

Abstract: Driving materials using light with more than one frequency component is an emerging technique, enabled by advanced pulse-shaping capabilities in recent years. Here, we translate this technique to lattice vibrations, by exciting multicolor phonons using terahertz cavities. In contrast to light, phonon frequencies are determined by the crystal structure and cannot readily be changed. We overcome this problem by tuning the frequencies of phonon polaritons in terahertz cavities to achieve the desired frequency ratios necessary for phononic Lissajous figures. This methodology enables dynamical crystallographic symmetry breaking and the creation of staggered phonon angular momentum and magnetic moment patterns.</description>

      <title>Squeezing light with optomechanical and spin-light quantum interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality of gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous quantum measurement of gravitational radiation. This is typically done by coupling the radiation to a meter, such as a resonant mass detector or an interferometer, which is subsequently read out by a detector. We find that the detector employed determines whether the gravitational field exhibits wave or particle characteristics. A linear detector, such as a homodyne detector, yields no signal for a field in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude of a field in a coherent state. Such a linear detector thus supports a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton, resulting in a quantum jump in energy equal to the energy of the absorbed graviton. Our results extend the principle of complementarity to quantized gravitational radiation, demonstrating the detector dependence of the graviton, and indicates that conceptually simple modifications to gravitational-wave detectors can make them graviton counters.</description>

      <title>Unlocking new dimensions in photonic computing using optical Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16311v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decline of Moore's law coupled with the growing dominance of artificial intelligence has recently motivated research into photonic computing as a high-bandwidth, low-power strategy to accelerate digital electronics. However, modern-day photonic computing strategies are predominantly analog, making them susceptible to noise and intrinsically difficult to scale. The optical Skyrmion offers a route to overcoming these limitations through digitization in the form of a discrete topological number that can be assigned to the analog optical field. Apart from an intrinsic robustness against perturbations, optical Skyrmions represent a new dimension that has yet to be exploited for photonic computing, namely spatially varying polarization. Here, we propose a method of performing perturbation-resilient integer arithmetic with this new dimension of optical Skyrmions through passive optical components and present experimental evidence demonstrating its feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such discrete mathematical operations have been directly achieved using optical Skyrmions without external energy input.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ptychography Reconstruction using the Hessian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a powerful and robust coherent imaging method providing access to the complex object and probe (illumination). Ptychography reconstruction is typically performed using first-order methods due to their computational efficiency. Higher-order methods, while potentially more accurate, are often prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. In this study, we present a mathematical framework for reconstruction using second-order information, derived from an efficient computation of the bilinear Hessian and Hessian operator. The formulation is provided for Gaussian based models, enabling the simultaneous reconstruction of the object, probe, and object positions. Synthetic data tests, along with experimental near-field ptychography data processing, demonstrate a ten-fold reduction in computation time compared to first-order methods. The derived formulas for computing the Hessians, along with the strategies for incorporating them into optimization schemes, are well-structured and easily adaptable to various ptychography problem formulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum resolution limit of long-baseline imaging using distributed entanglement</title>

Abstract: It has been shown that shared entanglement between two telescope sites can in principle be used to localize a point source by mimicking the standard phase-scanning interferometer, but without physically bringing the light from the distant telescopes together. In this paper, we show that a receiver that employs spatial-mode sorting at each telescope site, combined with pre-shared entanglement and local quantum operations can be used to mimic the most general multimode interferometer acting on light collected from the telescopes. As an example application to a quantitative passive-imaging problem, we show that the quantum-limited precision of estimating the angular separation between two stars can be attained by an instantiation of the aforesaid entanglement based receiver. We discuss how this entanglement assisted strategy can be used to achieve the quantum-limited precision of any complex quantitative imaging task involving any number of telescopes. We provide a blueprint of this general receiver that involves quantum transduction of starlight into quantum memory banks and spatial mode sorters deployed at each telescope site, and measurements that include optical detection as well as qubit gates and measurements on the quantum memories. We discuss the relative Fisher-information contributions of local mode sorting at telescope sites vis-a-vis distributed entanglement-assisted interferometry, to the overall quantum-limited information about the scene, based on the ratio of the baseline distance to the individual telescope diameter.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>

Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>
