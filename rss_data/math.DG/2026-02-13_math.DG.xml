      <title>$X$-ADM Mass and $X$-Positive Mass Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given admissible vector field $X$, we define a geometric quantity for asymptotically flat $3$--manifolds, called $X$--ADM mass and we establish a relative positive mass theorem via a monotonicity formula along the level sets of a suitable Green's function. Under different assumptions on $X$, we obtain generalizations of the ``classical'' positive mass theorem, like the one for weighted manifolds and the one ``with charge'' under some topological restrictions. Finally, we also discuss the rigidity cases.</description>

      <title>The total geodesic curvature and the $(2+1)$-dimensional hyperbolic mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Jordan domain diffeomorphic to a closed two-dimensional disk with a smooth boundary. Assuming the Gauss curvature of the domain has a negative lower bound, the Gauss-Bonnet formula provides an upper bound for the total geodesic curvature of the boundary curve. This bound, however, inherently depends on the interior geometry of the region. In this paper, we derive an upper bound for the total geodesic curvature expressed solely in terms of the boundary data. Notably, the proof is connected to the positivity of the hyperbolic Hamiltonian mass in the (2+1)-dimensional gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Estimates of the Hodge Laplacian Under Lower Ricci Curvature Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish uniform lower and upper bounds for the eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian acting on differential forms on closed Riemannian manifolds with a lower Ricci curvature bound, a positive lower bound on the injectivity radius, and an upper bound on the diameter. Our results extend earlier work of Dodziuk, Lott, and Mantuano, which required bounded sectional curvature, to the broader setting of lower Ricci curvature bounds. As applications, we obtain uniform eigenvalue bounds for the connection Laplacian acting on $1$-forms and establish a global Poincar\'e inequality for differential forms under the same geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Reparametrization of the Ligon--Schaaf Regularization in the Kepler problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Ligon--Schaaf regularization of the Kepler problem and identify the geometric origin of the rotation appearing in their transformation. We show that this rotation is determined by the eccentric anomaly of the Kepler motion, providing a transparent dynamical interpretation of the angle that renders the Kepler flow uniform on $T^{*}S^{3}$. Building on this insight, we extend the construction to positive and zero energies via the corresponding hyperbolic and parabolic anomalies, obtaining a unified geometric description of the Kepler flow across all energy levels.</description>

      <title>Local Integrable Symmetries of Diffieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of diffieties, introduced by Vinogradov, we introduce integrable infinitesimal symmetries and show that they define a one parameter pseudogroup of local diffiety morphisms. We prove some preliminary results allowing to reduce the computation of integrable infinitesimal symmetries of a given order to solving a system of partial differential equations.We provide examples for which we can reduce to a linear system that can be solved by hand computation, and investigate some consequences for the local classification of diffiety, with a special interest for testing if a diffiety is flat.</description>

      <title>Aleksandrov reflection for Geometric Flows in Hyperbolic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an Aleksandrov reflection framework for a large class of expanding curvature flows in hyperbolic space, with inverse mean curvature flow serving as a model case. The method applies to the level-set formulation of the flow. As a consequence, we obtain graphical and Lipschitz estimates. Using these estimates, we show that solutions become starshaped and therefore converge exponentially fast to an umbilic hypersurface at infinity. We also extend our results to the non-compact setting, assuming that the solution has a unique point at infinity. In this case, we prove that the flow becomes a graph over a horosphere with uniform gradient bounds and converges to a limiting horosphere.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for photon and massive particle hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the notion of massive particle hypersurfaces and place it within a unified framework alongside photon hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes. More precisely, for Killing-invariant timelike hypersurfaces $T=\mathbb{R}\times S_0$, where $S_0$ is a smooth embedded surface in a spacelike slice $S$ of the stationary spacetime, we show that $T$ is a photon hypersurface or a massive particle hypersurface if and only if $S_0$ is totally geodesic with respect to certain associated Finsler structures on the slice: a Randers metric governing null geodesics and a Jacobi--Randers metric governing timelike solutions of the Lorentz force equation at fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio. We also prove existence and multiplicity results for proper-time parametrized solutions of the Lorentz force equation with fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio, either connecting a point to a flow line of the Killing vector field or having periodic, non-constant projection on $S$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a simple proof that for several sites of interest in differential geometry, the local projective model structure and the \v{C}ech projective model structure are equal. In particular, this applies to the site of smooth manifolds with open covers and the site of cartesian spaces with good open covers. As an application, we show that for a presheaf of sets on these sites, applying the plus construction once is enough to sheafify.</description>

      <title>First variation of flat traces on negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a closed negatively curved surface $(X,g)$ the flat trace of the geodesic Koopman operators $V_g^\tau f=f\circ G_g^\tau$ is the periodic orbit distribution \[ \mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g}(\tau)=\sum_{\gamma}\frac{L_\gamma^{\#}}{\lvert\det(I-P_\gamma)\rvert}\,\delta(\tau-L_\gamma), \qquad \tau&gt;0, \] supported on the length spectrum and weighted by the linearized Poincar\'e maps $P_\gamma$. For a smooth family of negatively curved metrics $g_t$ we compute the first variation $\partial_t\vert_{0}\,\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}$ as a distribution. At an isolated length $\ell$ the leading singularity is a multiple of $\delta'(\tau-\ell)$, and its coefficient is an explicit linear functional of the length variations $\dot L_{\gamma^m}$ of the closed geodesics with $L_{\gamma^m}=\ell$. This transport coefficient forces the marked lengths to be locally constant along any deformation with constant flat trace. As an application, if $\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}=\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_0}$ for all $t$ then $g_t$ is isometric to $g_0$ for all $t$. Together with Sunada-type constructions of non isometric pairs with equal flat traces, this shows that the flat trace is globally non-unique yet locally complete along smooth families.</description>

Abstract: The first main result of this paper classifies contact 3-manifolds admitting critical metrics, i.e. adapted metrics which are the critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional. This gives a complete answer to a question raised by Chern-Hamilton in 1984. Secondly, we show that in the case of Anosov contact metrics, the optimization of such energy functional is closely related to Reeb dynamics and can be described in terms of its entropy. We also study the consequences in the curvature realization problem for such contact metrics.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Darboux Integrable Elliptic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize real elliptic differential systems whose solutions can be expressed in terms of holomorphic solutions to an associated holomorphic Pfaffian system $\mathcal H$ on a complex manifold. In particular, these elliptic systems arise as quotients by a group $G$ of the real differential system generated by the real and imaginary parts of $\mathcal H$, such that $G$ is the real form of a complex Lie group $K$ which is a symmetry group of $\mathcal H$. Subject to some mild genericity assumptions, we show that such elliptic systems are characterized by a property known as Darboux integrability. Examples discussed include first- and second-order elliptic PDE and PDE systems in the plane.</description>

      <title>Manifold Diffusion Geometry: Curvature, Tangent Spaces, and Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce novel estimators for computing the curvature, tangent spaces, and dimension of data from manifolds, using tools from diffusion geometry. Although classical Riemannian geometry is a rich source of inspiration for geometric data analysis and machine learning, it has historically been hard to implement these methods in a way that performs well statistically. Diffusion geometry lets us develop Riemannian geometry methods that are accurate and, crucially, also extremely robust to noise and low-density data. The methods we introduce here are comparable to the existing state-of-the-art on ideal dense, noise-free data, but significantly outperform them in the presence of noise or sparsity. In particular, our dimension estimate improves on the existing methods on a challenging benchmark test when even a small amount of noise is added. Our tangent space and scalar curvature estimates do not require parameter selection and substantially improve on existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Some results on calibrated submanifolds in Euclidean space of cohomogeneity one and two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct calibrated submanifolds in Euclidean space invariant under the action of a Lie group $G$. We first demonstrate the method used in this paper by reproducing the results about special Lagrangians due to Harvey-Lawson. We then show explicitly that an associative submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^7$ invariant under the action of a maximal torus $\mathbb{T}^2 \subset \mathrm{G}_2$ has to be a special Lagrangian submanifold in $\mathbb{C}^3$. Similarly, we also show that a Cayley submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^8$ invariant under the action of a maximal torus $\mathbb{T}^3 \subset \mathrm{Spin}(7)$ has to be a special Lagrangian submanifold in $\mathbb{C}^4$. We construct coassociative submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^7$ invariant under the action of $\mathrm{Sp}(1)\subset \mathbb{H}$ with a more general ansatz than the one in Harvey-Lawson but we recover exactly the $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$-invariant coassociatives in Harvey-Lawson, giving us a rigidity result. Finally, we construct cohomogeneity two examples of coassociative submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^7$ which are invariant under the action of a maximal torus $\mathbb{T}^2 \subset \mathrm{G}_2$.</description>

      <title>Local Models for Special K\"ahler Metric Singularities Along the Discriminant Locus of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Hitchin Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Freed (arXiv:hep-th/9712042) formulated special K\"ahler structures; in particular, the regular locus of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Hitchin base $\mathcal{B}$ carries such a structure, while the associated metric $\omega_{\mathrm{SK}}$ is singular along the discriminant locus $\mathcal{D}$. Baraglia-Huang (arXiv:1707.04975) computed its Taylor expansion near points of $\mathcal{B}\setminus\mathcal{D}$. Hitchin (arXiv:1712.09928) then defined subsystems attached to those components of $\mathcal{D}$ whose spectral curves have only nodal singularities; these components form smooth strata with induced special K\"ahler structures. We show that near such a stratum the canonical special K\"ahler metric has logarithmic asymptotics in transversal directions, whereas its tangential part converges to a metric on the stratum agreeing with the one from Hitchin's subsystems. Along any complex line through the origin of $\mathcal{B}$ and a point of the stratum, the metric restricts to a cone flat metric with cone angle $\pi$ at the origin only. Finally, the special K\"ahler potential extends continuously to these strata, and is $C^1$ on a portion of them.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Bonini et al. on the precise values of the Lin--Lu--Yau curvature of conference graphs, i.e., strongly regular graphs with parameters $(4\gamma+1,2\gamma,\gamma-1,\gamma)$. Our method depends only on the parameter relations and applies to broader classes of amply regular graphs. In particular, we develop a new combinatorial approach to show the existence of local perfect matchings. A key observation is that counting common neighbors leads to useful quadratic polynomials. As a corollary, we derive an interesting number-theoretic result concerning quadratic residues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finslerian extensions of Special and General Relativity -- commonly referred to as Very Special and Very General Relativity -- necessitate the development of a unified Lorentz-Finsler geometry. However, the scope of this geometric framework extends well beyond relativistic physics. Indeed, it offers powerful tools for modeling wave propagation in classical mechanics, discretizing spacetimes in classical and relativistic settings, and supporting effective theories in fundamental physics. Moreover, Lorentz-Finsler geometry provides a versatile setting that facilitates the resolution of problems within Riemannian, Lorentzian, and Finslerian geometries individually. This work presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts, key applications, and future prospects. The reviewed topics include (i) basics on the setting of cones, Finsler and Lorentz-Finsler metrics and their (nonlinear, anisotropic and linear) connections, (ii) the global structure of Lorentz-Finsler manifolds and its space of null geodesics, (iii) links among Riemannian, Finsler and Lorentz geometries, (iv) applications in classical settings as wildfires and seisms propagation, and discretization in classical and relativistic settings with quantum prospects, and (v) Finslerian variational approach to Einstein equations. The new results include the splitting of globally hyperbolic Finsler spacetimes, in addition to the analysis of several extensions of the Lorentz setting, as the case of timelike boundaries.</description>

Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a plurisubharmonic function defined in a neighborhood of the origin in $\mathbb C^n$. For each real number $t&gt;-n$, we associate to $\varphi$ the weighted log canonical threshold \[ c_t(\varphi):=\sup\Bigl\{c\geq 0:\|z\|^{2t}e^{-2c\varphi}\in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}} \text{ near }0\Bigr\}. \] In this paper, we prove a sharp slope inequality showing that all difference quotients of the function $t\mapsto c_t(\varphi)$ are uniformly controlled by the Lelong number $\nu_\varphi(0)$. Moreover, we derive explicit lower bounds for the growth of $c_t(\varphi)$ in terms of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere mass of $\varphi$ at the origin. Our arguments combine weighted integrability estimates, restrictions to complex lines, and techniques from pluripotential theory.</description>
