      <title>Computer Assisted Projective Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a computer assisted proof that about two thousand surgeries far away from the ideal point in the hyperbolic Dehn filling space of the figure-eight knot complement are infinitesimally projectively rigid. We also prove that for projective deformations of the figure-eight knot complement sufficiently close to the complete hyperbolic structure, the induced map on the first cohomology of the longitude of the boundary torus is non-zero. This paper provides a complementary piece to the results of Heusener and Porti who showed that for each k in Z, there is a sufficiently large Nk for which every k/n-Dehn filling on the figure-eight knot complement for n larger than Nk is infinitesimally projectively rigid. In the process of the proof, we provide explicit representations of the figure-eight knot complement in PSO(3,1) which are rational in the real and imaginary parts of the shapes of the ideal tetrahedra used to glue the knot complement together.</description>

      <title>Geodesic planes in a geometrically finite end and the halo of a measured lamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works [MMO1, arXiv:1802.03853, arXiv:1802.04423, arXiv:2101.08956] have shed light on the topological behavior of geodesic planes in the convex core of a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds $M$ of infinite volume. In this paper, we focus on the remaining case of geodesic planes outside the convex core of $M$, giving a complete classification of their closures in $M$.
  In particular, we show that the behavior is different depending on whether exotic roofs exist or not. Here an exotic roof is a geodesic plane contained in an end $E$ of $M$, which limits on the convex core boundary $\partial E$, but cannot be separated from the core by a support plane of $\partial E$.
  A necessary condition for the existence of exotic roofs is the existence of exotic rays for the bending lamination. Here an exotic ray is a geodesic ray that has finite intersection number with a measured lamination $\mathcal{L}$ but is not asymptotic to any leaf nor eventually disjoint from $\mathcal{L}$. We establish that exotic rays exist if and only if $\mathcal{L}$ is not a multicurve. The proof is constructive, and the ideas involved are important in the construction of exotic roofs.
  We also show that the existence of geodesic rays satisfying a stronger condition than being exotic, phrased in terms of only the hyperbolic surface $\partial E$ and the bending lamination, is sufficient for the existence of exotic roofs. As a result, we show that geometrically finite ends with exotic roofs exist in every genus. Moreover, in genus $1$, when the end is homotopic to a punctured torus, a generic one (in the sense of Baire category) contains uncountably many exotic roofs.</description>
