      <title>Continuous rainbow RABBITT investigation of resonant states in He and H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating By Interference of Two-photon Transitions with an advanced energy resolution (rainbow RABBITT) to resolve under-threshold discrete excitations and above-threshold auto-ionizing states in the He atom and the H$_2$ molecule. Both below and above the threshold, the whole series of resonances is reconstructed continuously and at once by the parity based separation of the two-photon ionization amplitude. This allows for an efficient extraction of the RABBITT magnitude and phase parameters without the need for adjusting the laser photon frequency. The latter parameters are then used to test the validity of the logarithmic Hilbert transform which relates the RABBITT phase and magnitude in the resonant region.</description>

      <title>Recoil nuclear size corrections in hydrogenic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulas for the combined nuclear-recoil and finite-nuclear-size effects of order $(Z\,\alpha)^5$ and $(Z\,\alpha)^6$ are derived without any expansion in the nuclear charge radius $r_C$, making them applicable to both electronic and muonic atoms. The obtained results are particularly relevant for high-precision determinations of root-mean-square charge radii from muonic atom spectroscopy. We demonstrate that calculations of the atomic isotope shift based on the widely used Breit approximation give rise to an unphysical nuclear-size contribution that is linear in the nuclear charge radius $r_C$ at order $(Z\,\alpha)^5$. This spurious term vanishes in a full QED treatment, leaving the correct contribution quadratic in $r_C$. For electronic atoms, this quadratic term is significantly smaller than the spurious linear contribution.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$ eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>

      <title>Delta-Kick Collimation of Heteronuclear Feshbach Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of delta-kick collimation (DKC) applied to heteronuclear Feshbach molecules, focusing on both condensed and thermal ensembles across various interaction and temperature regimes. We demonstrate that DKC enables significant reductions in molecular cloud expansion energies and beam divergence, achieving expansion energies in the picokelvin range, comparable to state-of-the-art results obtained experimentally with atoms. Furthermore, we show that vibrational and translational motions remain strongly decoupled throughout the process, ensuring molecular stability during the delta-kick. This work paves the way for advanced experimental sequences involving degenerate ground state molecules, light-pulse molecular interferometry, and applications of dual-species precision measurements, such as testing the universality of free fall.</description>

      <title>Counterflow of lattice polarons in harmonically confined optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional harmonically confined optical lattice interacting repulsively with a bosonic bath. The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows a combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality catastrophe and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Intensities of all fine-structure resolved rovibrational electric quadrupole absorption lines in $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$) calculated with a new $\textit{ab initio}$ quadrupole moment curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intensities of all rovibrational electric quadrupole absorption lines in $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$), for which the vibrational quantum number is $v \leq 35$ and the total angular momentum quantum number is $J \leq 40$, are calculated in the intermediate coupling using a new $\textit{ab initio}$ quadrupole moment curve of the ground electronic state of O$_2$. The calculated values agree with those available in the HITRAN database, which at present includes only the $1$-$0$ fundamental vibrational band of $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$). We therefore recommend using the intensities of the vibrational overtones and hot bands reported here in updating the HITRAN database for O$_2$ in the upcoming 2024 edition.</description>

      <title>Spin structure of diatomic van der Waals molecules of alkali atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure of weakly bound diatomic van der Waals molecules formed by two identical bosonic alkali atoms. Our studies were performed using known Born-Oppenheimer potentials while developing a reduced interaction potential model. Such reduced potential models are currently a key for solving certain classes of few-body problems of atoms as they decrease the numerical burden on the computation. Although the reduced potentials are significantly shallower than actual Born-Oppenheimer potentials, they still capture the main properties of the near-threshold bound states, including their spin structure, and the scattering states over a broad range of magnetic fields. At zero magnetic field, we find that the variation in spin structure across different alkali species originates from the interplay between electronic spin exchange and hyperfine interactions. To characterize this competition we introduce a single parameter, which is a function of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths, the atomic hyperfine splitting constant, and the molecular binding energy. We show that this parameter can be used to classify the spin structure of vdW molecules for each atomic species.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>
