      <title>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield.
  The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future orbital measurements of Mercury and near-Sun asteroids can refine these constraints.</description>

      <title>Triton and Pluto: same origin but separated at birth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the origin of Pluto and Triton has profound implications for the bigger picture of Solar System formation and evolution. In such a context, this chapter reviews our current knowledge of the formation conditions of Pluto and Triton's constitutive building blocks in the protosolar nebula, which can be derived from their known or estimated volatile contents. Assuming that the ultravolatiles carbon monoxide and dinitrogen detected in Pluto and Triton are primordial, the presence of these molecules suggest that the two bodies accreted material originating from the vicinity of the carbon monoxide and dinitrogen icelines. Dinitrogen--rich and water--poor comets such as comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS) obviously present a compositional link with Pluto and Triton, indicating that their building blocks formed in nearby regions of the protosolar nebula, despite of the variation of the water abundance among those bodies. Also, the assumption of Triton's growth in Neptune's circumplanetary disk requires that its building blocks formed at earlier epochs in the protosolar nebula, to remain consistent with its estimated composition.</description>

      <title>Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): PDS 111, an old T Tauri star with a young-looking disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between T Tauri stars and their circumstellar disks, and how this impacts the onset of planet formation has yet to be established. We studied a seemingly old T Tauri star, PDS 111, and its disk. We analyzed optical, infrared, and sub-millimeter observations obtained with VLT/X-shooter, Mercator/HERMES, TESS, VLT/SPHERE, and ALMA, providing a new view on PDS 111 and its protoplanetary disk. The multi-epoch spectroscopy yields photospheric lines to classify the star, and emission lines to study variability in the hot inner disk and to determine the mass-accretion rate. The SPHERE and ALMA observations are used to characterize the dust distribution of the small and large grains, respectively. PDS 111 is a weak-line T Tauri star with spectral type G2, exhibits strong H$\alpha$ variability and with a low mass-accretion rate of $1-5\times10^{-10}$\,M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$. We measured an age of the system of 15.9$^{+1.7}_{-3.7}$ Myr using pre-main sequence tracks. The SPHERE observations show a strongly flaring disk with an asymmetric substructure. The ALMA observations reveal a 30 au cavity in the dust continuum emission with a low contrast asymmetry in the South-West of the disk and a dust disk mass of 45.8\,$M_\oplus$. The $^{12}$CO radial extension is at least three times larger than that of the dust emission. Although the measured age is younger than suggested in literature, PDS 111 still seems relatively old; this provides insight into disk properties at an advanced stage of pre-main sequence evolution. The characteristics of this disk are very similar to its younger counterparts: strongly flaring, an average disk mass, a typical radial extent of the disk gas and dust, and the presence of common substructures. This suggests that disk evolution has not significantly changed the disk properties. These results show similarities with the "Peter Pan disks" around M-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Apsidal Precession in Binary Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the secondary in a binary asteroid plays an important role in the precession of the mutual orbit, this role has not been thoroughly studied. Given the complex spin-orbit coupled dynamics in binary asteroids, we use a numerical approach to study the relationship between the secondary's shape and spin and the apsidal precession rate of the orbit. Using this approach in conjunction with observations of Didymos, we find it is likely that Dimorphos was significantly reshaped as a result of the DART impact, with its new shape more elongated than the pre-impact shape. Finally, we show that non-principal axis rotation of the secondary can lead to a chaotic evolution of the longitude of the periapsis.</description>

      <title>Trials and Tribulations in the Reanalysis of KELT-24 b: a Case Study for the Importance of Stellar Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analysis of the KELT-24 system, comprising a well-aligned hot Jupiter, KELT-24~b, and a bright ($V=8.3$), nearby ($d=96.9~\mathrm{pc}$) F-type host star. KELT-24~b was independently discovered by two groups in 2019, with each reporting best-fit stellar parameters that were notably inconsistent. Here, we present three independent analyses of the KELT-24 system, each incorporating a broad range of photometric and spectroscopic data, including eight sectors of TESS photometry and more than 200 new radial velocities (RVs) from MINERVA. Two of these analyses use KELT-24's observed spectral energy distribution (SED) through a direct comparison to stellar evolutionary models, while our third analysis assumes an unknown additional body contributing to the observed broadband photometry and excludes the SED. Ultimately, we find that the models that include the SED are a poor fit to the available data, so we adopt the system parameters derived without it. We also highlight a single transit-like event observed by TESS, deemed likely to be an eclipsing binary bound to KELT-24, that will require follow-up observations to confirm. We discuss the potential of these additional bodies in the KELT-24 system as a possible explanation for the discrepancies between the results of the different modeling approaches, and explore the system for longer-period planets that may be weakly evident in the RV observations. The comprehensive investigations that we present not only increase the fidelity of our understanding of the KELT-24 system, but also serve as a blueprint for future stellar modeling in global analyses of exoplanet systems.</description>

      <title>From Super-Earths to Sub-Neptunes: observational constraints and connections to theoretical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update the PlanetS catalog of transiting planets with precise and robust mass and radius measurements and use this comprehensive catalog to explore Mass-Radius (M-R) diagrams. On one hand, we propose new M-R relationships to separate exoplanets into three populations. On the other hand, we explore the transition in radius and density between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes around M-dwarfs and compare it with those orbiting K- and FG-dwarfs. Using Kernel Density Estimation method with a re-sampling technique, we estimate the normalized density and radius distributions, revealing connections between observations and theories on composition, internal structure, formation, and evolution of these exoplanets orbiting different spectral types. Firstly, the substantial 30% increase in the number of well-characterized exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs compared with previous studies shows us that there is no clear gap in either composition or radius between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes. The "water-worlds" around M-dwarfs cannot correspond to a distinct population, their bulk density and equilibrium temperature can be interpreted by several different internal structures and compositions. The continuity in the fraction of volatiles in these planets suggests a formation scenario involving planetesimal or hybrid pebble-planetesimal accretion. Moreover, we find that the transition between Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes appears to happen at different mass (and radii) depending on the spectral type of the star. The maximum mass of Super-Earths seems to be close to 10 M$_\oplus$ for all spectral types, but the minimum mass of Sub-Neptunes increases with the star's mass. This effect also contributes to the fading of the radius valley for M-planets compared to FGK-planets. While Sub-Neptunes are less common around M-dwarfs, smaller ones exhibit lower density than their equivalents around FGK-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the accretion disc spectra of Dwarf Novae and Novalike variables: implications for the standard disc model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion discs are fundamental to much of astronomy. They can occur around stars both young and old, around compact objects they provide a window into the extremes of physics, and around supermassive black holes in galaxy centres they generate spectacular luminosities that can outshine the entire galaxy. However, our understanding of the inner workings of accretion discs remains far from complete. Here we revisit a conundrum in the observations of some of the simplest accreting systems; the Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). The high-accretion-rate states of (non-magnetic) CVs can be divided into the short-lived outbursts ($\sim$ a week) typical of dwarf novae (DNe) and the long-lived (and sometimes perpetual) high states of nova-like (NL) CVs. Since both sorts of high-state occur in approximately steady-state accretion discs with similar properties and accretors, we would expect them to display similar spectral energy distributions. However, previous analyses based on UV spectra from the {\it International Ultraviolet Explorer} have shown that their spectral energy distributions are different. We perform a re-analysis of the data using up to date calibrations and distance (and thus dereddening) estimates to test whether this difference persists and whether it is statistically significant over the sample. We find that it does persist and it is statistically significant. We propose routes to investigating this discrepancy further and discuss the implications this has for other accreting systems, such as X-ray binaries, Active Galactic Nuclei and protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>PyExoCross: a Python program for generating spectra and cross-sections from molecular line lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PyExoCross is a Python adaptation of the ExoCross Fortran application, PyExoCross is designed for postprocessing the huge molecular line lists generated by the ExoMol project and other similar initiatives such as the HITRAN and HITEMP databases. PyExoCross generates absorption and emission stick spectra, cross-sections, and other properties (partition functions, specific heats, cooling functions, lifetimes, and oscillator strengths) based on molecular line lists. PyExoCross calculates cross-sections with four line profiles: Doppler, Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt profiles in both sampling and binned methods; a number of options are available for computing Voigt profiles which we test for speed and accuracy. PyExoCross supports importing and exporting line lists in the ExoMol and HITRAN/HITEMP formats. PyExoCross also provides conversion between the ExoMol and HITRAN data formats. In addition, PyExoCross has extra code for users to automate the batch download of line list files from the ExoMol database.</description>

      <title>High contrast at short separation with VLTI/GRAVITY: Bringing Gaia companions to light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2019, GRAVITY has provided direct observations of giant planets and brown dwarfs at separations of down to 95 mas from the host star. Some of these observations have provided the first direct confirmation of companions previously detected by indirect techniques (astrometry and radial velocities). We want to improve the observing strategy and data reduction in order to lower the inner working angle of GRAVITY in dual-field on-axis mode. We also want to determine the current limitations of the instrument when observing faint companions with separations in the 30-150 mas range. To improve the inner working angle, we propose a fiber off-pointing strategy during the observations to maximize the ratio of companion-light-to-star-light coupling in the science fiber. We also tested a lower-order model for speckles to decouple the companion light from the star light. We then evaluated the detection limits of GRAVITY using planet injection and retrieval in representative archival data. We compare our results to theoretical expectations. We validate our observing and data-reduction strategy with on-sky observations; first in the context of brown dwarf follow-up on the auxiliary telescopes with HD 984 B, and second with the first confirmation of a substellar candidate around the star Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464. With synthetic companion injection, we demonstrate that the instrument can detect companions down to a contrast of $8\times 10^{-4}$ ($\Delta \mathrm{K}= 7.7$ mag) at a separation of 35 mas, and a contrast of $3\times 10^{-5}$ ($\Delta \mathrm{K}= 11$ mag) at 100 mas from a bright primary (K&lt;6.5), for 30 min exposure time. With its inner working angle and astrometric precision, GRAVITY has a unique reach in direct observation parameter space. This study demonstrates the promising synergies between GRAVITY and Gaia for the confirmation and characterization of substellar companions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the directly imaged HD 1160 system through spectroscopic characterization and high-cadence variability monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time variability and spectra of directly imaged companions provide insight into their physical properties and atmospheric dynamics. We present follow-up R~40 spectrophotometric monitoring of red companion HD 1160 B at 2.8-4.2 $\mu$m using the double-grating 360{\deg} vector Apodizing Phase Plate (dgvAPP360) coronagraph and ALES integral field spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. We use the recently developed technique of gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry to produce differential light curves for HD 1160 B. We reproduce the previously reported ~3.2 h periodic variability in archival data, but detect no periodic variability in new observations taken the following night with a similar 3.5% level precision, suggesting rapid evolution in the variability of HD 1160 B. We also extract complementary spectra of HD 1160 B for each night. The two are mostly consistent, but the companion appears fainter on the second night between 3.0-3.2 $\mu$m. Fitting models to these spectra produces different values for physical properties depending on the night considered. We find an effective temperature T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2794$^{+115}_{-133}$ K on the first night, consistent with the literature, but a cooler T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2279$^{+79}_{-157}$ K on the next. We estimate the mass of HD 1160 B to be 16-81 M$_{\text{Jup}}$, depending on its age. We also present R = 50,000 high-resolution optical spectroscopy of host star HD 1160 A obtained simultaneously with the PEPSI spectrograph. We reclassify its spectral type to A1 IV-V and measure its projected rotational velocity v sin i = 96$^{+6}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus highlight that gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry can achieve repeatable few percent level precision and does not yet reach a systematic noise floor, suggesting greater precision is achievable with additional data or advanced detrending techniques.</description>

Abstract: Planets orbiting binary systems are relatively unexplored compared to those around single stars. Detections of circumbinary planets and planetary systems offer a first detailed view into our understanding of circumbinary planet formation and dynamical evolution. The BEBOP (Binaries Escorted by Orbiting Planets) radial velocity survey plays a special role in this adventure as it focuses on eclipsing single-lined binaries with an FGK dwarf primary and M dwarf secondary allowing for the highest-radial velocity precision using the HARPS and SOPHIE spectrographs. We obtained 4512 high-resolution spectra for the 179 targets in the BEBOP survey which we used to derive the stellar atmospheric parameters using both equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. We furthermore derive stellar masses, radii, and ages for all targets. With this work, we present the first homogeneous catalogue of precise stellar parameters for these eclipsing single-lined binaries.</description>
