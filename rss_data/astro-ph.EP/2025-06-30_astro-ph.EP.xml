      <title>Are Helium Atmospheres Hiding as Volatile-rich in Current Exoplanet Analysis Frameworks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of detailed exoplanet observations offers an opportunity to refine our analyses and interpretations, and uncover previously-hidden trends. One such trend is unexpectedly high water abundances ($\sim$1$-$10\%) for several hot Jupiters. Here, we show that such atmospheres may instead be helium-rich, and the perceived high water abundances simply biases in analyses compensating for ``ad hocly'' fixed helium-to-hydrogen ratio (He/H$_2$ = 0.157). As transmission spectra constrain the atmospheric scale height ($H$), a helium-enriched atmosphere can be misinterpreted as H$_2$-dominated water-rich to bring the mean molecular weight ($\mu$) to intermediate values ($\sim$4$-$15) when He/H$_2$ is fixed. We present a proof-of-concept reanalysis of HD~209458~b's JWST transmission spectrum treating He/H$_2$ as a free parameter, resulting in sets of solutions with helium enrichment and non-extreme water abundance. The He-enhancement found requires an order of magnitude less enrichment/evolution than does a water abundance of 10\%, suggesting that the He-rich hypothesis is a viable alternative. We argue that He enhancement must be considered to reliably constrain atmospheric composition, be sensitive to a more diverse planetary population, and ultimately yield robust metallicity trends to inform formation/evolution pathways. Looking ahead, we suggest leveraging insights from differences in pressure-broadening effects, outflow measurements, and atmospheric chemistry to help disentangle reliably between He- and volatile-rich atmospheres -- while recognizing that existing opacity/outflow/chemistry models may need targeted upgrades to reach the required fidelity level.</description>

      <title>Polar alignment of a circumbinary disc around a brown dwarf binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent observations suggesting that the retrograde precession of the brown dwarf binary 2M1510 AB is consistent with induction by a polar circumbinary planet, we investigate the formation of such planets by studying the evolution of a primordial misaligned circumbinary disc around a brown dwarf binary. Analytical calculations show that a critical tilt angle of $i_{\rm crit} \gtrsim 50^\circ$ for moderately eccentric binaries is needed for polar alignment of circumbinary discs in systems with low disc-to-binary angular momentum ratios. For higher ratios, this angle converges to the Kozai-Lidov instability threshold of $\sim 39^\circ$. We identify disc parameters, such as viscosity ($\alpha = 10^{-4}$) and aspect ratio ($H/r = 0.05$), that enable polar alignment within typical disc lifetimes. Notably, a circumbinary disc around a low-mass binary, such as a brown dwarf binary, will require more time to achieve polar alignment compared to higher-mass systems. A hydrodynamical simulation confirms that an initially inclined disc around a brown dwarf evolves towards a polar state, creating favorable conditions for polar planet formation. Using these results, we finish by placing 2M1510 AB into a wider context and speculate why such a polar circumbinary configuration has not been identified before.</description>

      <title>A dynamical coherency gate for state recovery: Statistical requiem for the long arc of cislunar orbital mis-prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistically grounded methodology for recovering physically consistent initial conditions from historical two-line element sets (TLEs), enabling accurate long-arc trajectory reconstruction for distant and highly eccentric Earth satellites. The approach combines numerical averaging of osculating orbital elements with Gaussian-mixture-model (GMM) filtering with robust fallback strategies to isolate a dynamically coherent subset of mean elements at a common reference epoch. From this filtered ensemble, a representative osculating element is reconstructed, yielding a recovered Cartesian state vector with predictive capability far exceeding that of raw TLE-based propagations and existing approaches. We apply this method to the case of OGO-1 (1964-054A), a spacecraft launched into a cislunar orbit and tracked intermittently over five decades. Despite large observational gaps and significant secular evolution, our recovered state, used within an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), accurately reproduces the full trajectory, including its atmospheric reentry in August 2020, to within one day of the true decay time. This result demonstrates the viability of filtered TLE statistics as a proxy for precise orbit determination, particularly in dynamical regimes where resonances and long-period perturbations dominate. The techniques presented here provide a framework for trajectory reconstruction and prediction using only publicly available data and are broadly applicable to the study of high-altitude debris objects and legacy space missions whose original tracking and covariance data are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Dynamics and Chemistry of Transiting Exoplanets with the Habitable World Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary scientific objective of this Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Science Case Development Document (SCDD) is to measure planetary rotation rates of transiting exoplanets to determine the structure, composition, circulation, and aerosol properties of their planetary atmospheres. For this analysis, HWO would obtain spectroscopic phase curves for planets with orbital periods of 5 - 20+ days, to assess tidal locking radius assumptions. Extending phase curve studies out to longer orbital periods than accessible with current and near-future telescopes will enable detailed investigation of atmospheric structure, composition, and circulation for planets that are much cooler than the more highly irradiated planets accessible with JWST phase curve observations (i.e., Teq &lt; 500 K for HWO versus 1400 K &lt;= Teq &lt;= 2600 K for JWST). Broad wavelength coverage extending from the UV to the NIR would capture both reflected light and thermal emission, enabling HWO to conduct comprehensive characterization of planetary atmospheres. UV observations would probe high altitudes, thereby providing valuable insights into atmospheric (dis)equilibrium, aerosol properties, and the effects of photochemical processes on atmospheric composition. We also discuss the role of polarimetry in the classification of aerosols and the associated role they play in the atmospheric energy budget that directly ties them to the chemistry and circulation structure of the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>A systematic bias in template-based RV extraction algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we identify and explore a previously unidentified, multi meter-per-second, systematic correlation between time and RVs inferred through TM and LBL methods. We evaluate the influence of the data-driven stellar template in the RV bias and hypothesize on the possible sources of this effect. We first use the s-BART pipeline to extract RVs from three different datasets gathered over four nights of ESPRESSO and HARPS observations. Then, we demonstrate that the effect can be recovered on a larger sample of 19 targets, totaling 4124 ESPRESSO observations spread throughout 38 nights. We also showcase the presence of the bias in RVs extracted with the SERVAL and ARVE pipelines. Lastly, we explore the construction of the stellar template through the 5 years of ESPRESSO observations of HD10700, totalling more than 2000 observations. We find that a systematic quasi-linear bias affects the RV extraction with slopes that vary from -0.3 m/s-1/h-1 to -52 m/s-1/h-1 in our sample. This trend is not observed in CCF RVs and appears when all observations of a given star are collected within a short time-period (timescales of hours). We show that this systematic contamination exists in the RV time-series of two different template-matching pipelines, one line-by-line pipeline, and that it is agnostic to the spectrograph. We also find that this effect is connected with the construction of the stellar template, as we are able to mitigate it through a careful selection of the observations used to construct it. Our results suggest that a contamination of micro-telluric features, coupled other sources of correlated noise, could be the driving factor of this effect. We also show that this effect does not impact the usual usage of template-matching for the detection and characterization of exoplanets. Other short-timescale science cases can however be severely affected.</description>

      <title>On inertial forces (indirect terms) in problems with a central body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational systems in astrophysics often comprise a body -- the primary -- that far outweights the others, and which is taken as the centre of the reference frame. A fictitious acceleration, also known as the indirect term, must therefore be added to all other bodies in the system to compensate for the absence of motion of the primary. In this paper, we first stress that there is not one indirect term but as many indirect terms as there are bodies in the system that exert a gravitational pull on the primary. For instance, in the case of a protoplanetary disc with two planets, there are three indirect terms: one arising from the whole disc, and one per planet. We also highlight that the direct and indirect gravitational accelerations should be treated in a balanced way: the indirect term from one body should be applied to the other bodies in the system that feel its direct gravitational acceleration, and only to them. We point to situations where one of those terms is usually neglected however, which may lead to spurious results. These ideas are developed here for star-disc-planets interactions, for which we propose a recipe for the force to be applied onto a migrating planet, but they can easily be generalized to other astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal Inertia Controls on Titan's Surface Temperature and Planetary Boundary Layer Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding Titan's planetary boundary layer (PBL) -- the lowest region of the atmosphere influenced by surface conditions -- remains challenging due to Titan's thick atmosphere and limited observations. Previous modeling studies have also produced inconsistent estimates of surface temperature, a critical determinant of PBL behavior, often without clear explanations grounded in surface energy balance. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework and apply a three-dimensional dry general circulation model (GCM) to investigate how surface thermal inertia influences surface energy balance and temperature variability across diurnal and seasonal timescales. At diurnal timescales, lower thermal inertia surfaces exhibit larger temperature swings and enhanced sensible heat fluxes due to inefficient subsurface heat conduction. In contrast, at seasonal timescales, surface temperature variations show weak sensitivity to thermal inertia, as atmospheric damping tends to dominate over subsurface conduction. The PBL depth ranges from a few hundred meters to 1,000 m on diurnal timescales, while seasonal maxima reach 2,000--3,000 m, supporting the interpretation from a previous study that the Huygens probe captured the two PBL structures. Simulated seasonal winds at the Huygens landing site successfully reproduce key observed features, including near-surface retrograde winds and meridional wind reversals within the lowest few kilometers, consistent with Titan's cross-equatorial Hadley circulation. Simulations at the planned Dragonfly landing site predict shallower thermal PBLs with broadly similar wind patterns. This work establishes a physically grounded framework for understanding Titan's surface temperature and boundary layer variability, and offers a unified explanation of Titan's PBL behavior that provides improved guidance for future missions.</description>

      <title>The NEID Earth Twin Survey. III. Survey Performance After Three Years on Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) has been delivering a rich set of precise radial velocity (RV) measurements for 41 bright, nearby main sequence stars. Here, we describe the status of the survey after three years on sky and we present the full set of RV measurements and accompanying stellar activity indicators. We discuss intermediate survey diagnostics, including calibration of the known RV zero point offset introduced following the Contreras fire in 2022 and the identification of an undiagnosed and previously unknown zero point offset in 2021. An analysis of our data set using exttt{RVSearch} demonstrates that for these target stars, NEID is independently sensitive to nearly all known planets with periods shorter than the NETS observing baseline. We also highlight a number of newly detected RV signals, which present exciting opportunities for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of images of protoplanetary disks after collision with free-floating planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational manifestations of disturbances in a protoplanetary disk caused by a collision with a massive planet are studied. It is assumed that the planet moves along a parabolic trajectory that intersects the disk plane near the star. Gas-dynamic simulation is performed using the finite volume method on a long time scale. On its basis, images of the disk observed from the pole and edge-on are constructed in the infrared and submillimeter ranges. A wide range of planet orbit parameters is considered. The approach of the planet was considered both prograde and retrograde with the respect to the disk rotation. Calculations have shown that in the images of the disk seen pole-on, two spiral arms can be observed in case of the prograde fall, and one with retrograde case. In the case of observations of a disk whose plane is inclined at a small angle to the line of sight, distortions of the disk plane can be noticeable. In addition, a gas tail is extended from the disk in the direction of the planet's motion, which can also be identified in observations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Transport-induced Chemistry on Temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b, Part I: the Effects of Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low equilibrium temperatures of temperate sub-Neptunes lead to extremely long chemical timescales in their upper atmospheres, causing the abundances of chemical species to be strongly shaped by atmospheric transport. Here, we used a three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model involving a passive tracer to investigate the atmospheric circulation and 3D transport of temperate gas-rich sub-Neptunes, using K2-18b as an example. We model K2-18b as a synchronous or asynchronous rotator, exploring spin-orbit resonances (SOR) of 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1. We find that the strong absorption of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ induces a detached convective zone between 1 and 5 bar, resulting in strong vertical mixing at these levels. The upper atmosphere is dominated by eastward winds (an equatorial superrotating jet present in all simulations), leading to warmer evening terminators and approximately 20% higher passive tracer mass mixing ratios compared to the morning terminators. Rotation rates have minimal impact on the strength of global mean vertical mixing, but significantly influence the latitudinal distribution of passive tracers. For synchronous, 2:1 SOR, and 6:1 SOR simulations, passive tracers are more abundant in the upwelling branches at latitudes within 60$^\circ$, while for the 10:1 SOR simulation, strong transient eddies at high latitudes (&gt;70$^\circ$) between 0.1 to 1 bar can transport passive tracers upward from the deep atmosphere, making them more abundant there, despite their alignment with the downwelling branch of the large-scale circulation. This study focuses on the atmospheric dynamics and its influence on passive tracer transport, while a follow-up paper will incorporate active chemical species.</description>

      <title>A planet-host ratio relation to synthesize microlensing and transiting exoplanet demography from Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will be the first survey able to detect large numbers of both cold and hot exoplanets across Galactic distances: ~1,400 cold exoplanets via microlensing and ~200,000 hot, transiting planets. Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the microlensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass-radius relation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet-host ratio relation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables. Unlike the MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can leverage the full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\delta$, and planet-host mass ratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is improved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature, $T_{\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\delta (q,T_\star, P)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on $T_\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$ itself depends on $T_\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of the break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\%$ relative precision in $\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\%$ of the sample has a transit depth that is strongly under-predicted by the PHRR; around half of these are associated with large stars ($R_\star &gt; 2.5 \, R_{\odot}$) potentially subject to Malmquist bias.</description>

      <title>Tidal Inflation is Stronger for Misaligned Neptune-Sized Planets Than Aligned Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed an intriguing abundance of polar-orbiting Neptune-sized planets, many of which exhibit unusually inflated radii. While such misaligned orbits point to a complex dynamical history, the connection between their orbital orientations and planetary structures remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze a sample of 12 misaligned and 12 aligned planets using structure models that incorporate tidal heating. We use various statistical tests to demonstrate with at least $90\%$ confidence that misaligned planets experience more tidally-induced radius inflation compared to aligned planets. This inflation likely stems from their dynamically active histories, which often place them in close-in, eccentric, and highly inclined orbits. We further present a case study of WASP-107~b, an exceptionally inflated polar Neptune, and model its history using a simple coupled orbital and radius evolution approach. Our results place constraints on the planet's tidal quality factor that agree with recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred canonical coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse square and inverse cubic radial forces (or any superposition thereof) on any finite-dimensional Euclidean space. From these solutions, a new set of orbit elements for Kepler-Coulomb dynamics is derived, along with their variational equations for arbitrary perturbations (singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion). Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem, incorporating the J_2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

Abstract: The Ukrainian satellite telescope of electrons and protons STEP-F conducted a scientific experiment in space on board the low Earth orbit spacecraft "CORONAS-Photon" in 2009. In the article it is described the background, stages of development, manufacturing and tests of weight-dimensional, breadboard, technological, flight and auxiliary models of the instrument, and of the control and test suites for the STEP-F. The principles of operation, design, and technical and scientific characteristics of the instrument have been described. Stages of adjustment, graduating and autonomous, docking, complex, ground pre-flight and flight tests have been shown. Scientific results obtained by the STEP-F instrument during the time of deep minimum of solar activity demonstrate the detection of new features in high-energy charged particle distributions inside radiation belts of the Earth, in the region of the Brazilian magnetic anomaly, and outside of the referred volumes.
  Keywords: Earth$'$s magnetosphere, satellite instrument, scintillation detector, silicon matrix, charged particles, radiation belt, solar activity, Brazilian magnetic anomaly.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Suns radial velocity variability due to supergranulation over a magnetic cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years supergranulation has emerged as one of the biggest challenges for the detection of Earth-twins in radial velocity planet searches. We used eight years of Sun-as-a-star radial velocity observations from HARPS-N to measure the quiet-Sun's granulation and supergranulation properties of most of its 11-year activity cycle, after correcting for the effects of magnetically active regions using two independent methods. In both cases, we observe a clear, order of magnitude variation in the time-scale of the supergranulation component, which is largest at activity minimum and is strongly anti-correlated with the relative Sunspot number. We also explored a range of observational strategies which could be employed to characterise supergranulation in stars other than the Sun, showing that a comparatively long observing campaign of at least 23 nights is required, but that up to 10 stars can be monitored simultaneously in the process. We conclude by discussing plausible explanations for the "supergranulation" cycle.</description>

      <title>Studying Protoplanets and Protoplanetary Disks with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star, the confirmation of nearly 6000 exoplanets to date - and their diversity - has revolutionized our knowledge of planetary systems in the past three decades. Nevertheless, the majority of these planets are around mature stars (${\gtrsim}1$ Gyr), where the planet birth environments have already dissipated. Indeed, we have only confirmed 2 forming planets (i.e., protoplanets; ${\lesssim}10$ Myr) residing in one single system. In comparison, we have imaged over 200 protoplanetary disks in the past decade, with many of them hosting substructures such as spirals and gaps which suggest the existence of protoplanets. To understand the early stages of planet formation, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - with its high-contrast imaging and integral field spectroscopy capabilities - presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of the natal stages of planet formation and their birth environments. We propose to image protoplanets within substructured protoplanetary disks using HWO via direct imaging, and characterize them (i.e., protoplanets, protoplanetary disks, circumplanetary disks) using integral field spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry. This effort will dramatically extend current population of protoplanets, probing and characterizing over 200 protoplanets. By expanding the number of protoplanets by two orders of magnitude, these observations will test and refine planet formation theory and planet-disk interaction theory, and further motivate planet migration studies together with existing mature planets. The results will offer critical insight into planetary system formation and evolution, and help understand the origin of our own Solar System.</description>

      <title>CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with ~15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, `When does planet formation begin?', we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{bol} \le 1900 K$). To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of $T_{bol}$, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least 4 resolution elements ($\theta_{disk}/\theta_{res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the $T_{bol}$ measurements to constrain the lower and upper limits of $T_{bol}$ for each source. We find that by $T_{bol}$ ~200-400 K, substructure detection rates increased sharply to ~60%, corresponding to an age of ~0.2-0.4 Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of structures at early Class I could represent only an upper limit. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. If protostellar disk substructures do follow an evolutionary sequence, then our results imply that disk substructures evolve very rapidly and thus can be present in all Class I/II stages and/or that they can be triggered at different times.</description>

      <title>Jupiter's ultraviolet auroral bridge: the influence of the solar wind on polar auroral morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jupiters ultraviolet aurora frequently shows a number of arcs between the dusk-side polar region and the main emission, which are denoted as bridges. This work presents a largely automated detection and statistical analysis of bridges over 248 Hubble-Space-Telescope observations, alongside a multi-instrument study of crossings of magnetic field lines connected to bridges by the Juno spacecraft during its first 30 perijoves. Bridges are observed to arise on timescales of around 2 hours, can persist over a full Jupiter rotation, and are conjugate between hemispheres. The appearance of bridges is associated with compression of the magnetosphere, likely by the solar wind. Low-altitude bridge crossings are associated with upward-dominated, broadband electron distributions, consistent with Zone-II aurorae, as well as with plasma-wave emission observed by Juno-Waves, in agreement with existing theoretical models for the generation of polar-region aurorae. Main-emission crossings where no bridges are visible also show characteristics associated with bridges (more upward electron flux, plasma-wave emission), which is not the case for main-emission crossings with visible bridges, as though bridges remain present but spatially indistinguishable from the main emission in the former case. In all, compression of the magnetosphere may work to spatially separate the Zone-I and Zone-II regions of the main emission, in the form of Zone-II bridges.</description>
