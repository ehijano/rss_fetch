      <title>An Empirical Comparison of Video Frame Sampling Methods for Multi-Modal RAG Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous video frame sampling methodologies detailed in the literature present a significant challenge in determining the optimal video frame method for Video RAG pattern without a comparative side-by-side analysis. In this work, we investigate the trade-offs in frame sampling methods for Video &amp; Frame Retrieval using natural language questions. We explore the balance between the quantity of sampled frames and the retrieval recall score, aiming to identify efficient video frame sampling strategies that maintain high retrieval efficacy with reduced storage and processing demands. Our study focuses on the storage and retrieval of image data (video frames) within a vector database required by Video RAG pattern, comparing the effectiveness of various frame sampling techniques. Our investigation indicates that the recall@k metric for both text-to-video and text-to-frame retrieval tasks using various methods covered as part of this work is comparable to or exceeds that of storing each frame from the video. Our findings are intended to inform the selection of frame sampling methods for practical Video RAG implementations, serving as a springboard for innovative research in this domain.</description>

      <title>MultiHateClip: A Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Hateful Video Detection on YouTube and Bilibili</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech is a pressing issue in modern society, with significant effects both online and offline. Recent research in hate speech detection has primarily centered on text-based media, largely overlooking multimodal content such as videos. Existing studies on hateful video datasets have predominantly focused on English content within a Western context and have been limited to binary labels (hateful or non-hateful), lacking detailed contextual information. This study presents MultiHateClip1 , an novel multilingual dataset created through hate lexicons and human annotation. It aims to enhance the detection of hateful videos on platforms such as YouTube and Bilibili, including content in both English and Chinese languages. Comprising 2,000 videos annotated for hatefulness, offensiveness, and normalcy, this dataset provides a cross-cultural perspective on gender-based hate speech. Through a detailed examination of human annotation results, we discuss the differences between Chinese and English hateful videos and underscore the importance of different modalities in hateful and offensive video analysis. Evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification models, such as VLM, GPT-4V and Qwen-VL, on MultiHateClip highlight the existing challenges in accurately distinguishing between hateful and offensive content and the urgent need for models that are both multimodally and culturally nuanced. MultiHateClip represents a foundational advance in enhancing hateful video detection by underscoring the necessity of a multimodal and culturally sensitive approach in combating online hate speech.</description>

      <title>Towards Multimodal Emotional Support Conversation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health care promises a new horizon for therapist-client interactions, aiming to closely emulate the depth and nuance of human conversations. Despite the potential, the current landscape of conversational AI is markedly limited by its reliance on single-modal data, constraining the systems' ability to empathize and provide effective emotional support. This limitation stems from a paucity of resources that encapsulate the multimodal nature of human communication essential for therapeutic counseling. To address this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Emotional Support Conversation (MESC) dataset, a first-of-its-kind resource enriched with comprehensive annotations across text, audio, and video modalities. This dataset captures the intricate interplay of user emotions, system strategies, system emotion, and system responses, setting a new precedent in the field. Leveraging the MESC dataset, we propose a general Sequential Multimodal Emotional Support framework (SMES) grounded in Therapeutic Skills Theory. Tailored for multimodal dialogue systems, the SMES framework incorporates an LLM-based reasoning model that sequentially generates user emotion recognition, system strategy prediction, system emotion prediction, and response generation. Our rigorous evaluations demonstrate that this framework significantly enhances the capability of AI systems to mimic therapist behaviors with heightened empathy and strategic responsiveness. By integrating multimodal data in this innovative manner, we bridge the critical gap between emotion recognition and emotional support, marking a significant advancement in conversational AI for mental health support.</description>

      <title>Concept Conductor: Orchestrating Multiple Personalized Concepts in Text-to-Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The customization of text-to-image models has seen significant advancements, yet generating multiple personalized concepts remains a challenging task. Current methods struggle with attribute leakage and layout confusion when handling multiple concepts, leading to reduced concept fidelity and semantic consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free framework, Concept Conductor, designed to ensure visual fidelity and correct layout in multi-concept customization. Concept Conductor isolates the sampling processes of multiple custom models to prevent attribute leakage between different concepts and corrects erroneous layouts through self-attention-based spatial guidance. Additionally, we present a concept injection technique that employs shape-aware masks to specify the generation area for each concept. This technique injects the structure and appearance of personalized concepts through feature fusion in the attention layers, ensuring harmony in the final image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Concept Conductor can consistently generate composite images with accurate layouts while preserving the visual details of each concept. Compared to existing baselines, Concept Conductor shows significant performance improvements. Our method supports the combination of any number of concepts and maintains high fidelity even when dealing with visually similar concepts.

      <title>TALE: Training-free Cross-domain Image Composition via Adaptive Latent Manipulation and Energy-guided Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TALE, a novel training-free framework harnessing the generative capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models to address the cross-domain image composition task that focuses on flawlessly incorporating user-specified objects into a designated visual contexts regardless of domain disparity. Previous methods often involve either training auxiliary networks or finetuning diffusion models on customized datasets, which are expensive and may undermine the robust textual and visual priors of pre-trained diffusion models. Some recent works attempt to break the barrier by proposing training-free workarounds that rely on manipulating attention maps to tame the denoising process implicitly. However, composing via attention maps does not necessarily yield desired compositional outcomes. These approaches could only retain some semantic information and usually fall short in preserving identity characteristics of input objects or exhibit limited background-object style adaptation in generated images. In contrast, TALE is a novel method that operates directly on latent space to provide explicit and effective guidance for the composition process to resolve these problems. Specifically, we equip TALE with two mechanisms dubbed Adaptive Latent Manipulation and Energy-guided Latent Optimization. The former formulates noisy latents conducive to initiating and steering the composition process by directly leveraging background and foreground latents at corresponding timesteps, and the latter exploits designated energy functions to further optimize intermediate latents conforming to specific conditions that complement the former to generate desired final results. Our experiments demonstrate that TALE surpasses prior baselines and attains state-of-the-art performance in image-guided composition across various photorealistic and artistic domains.</description>

      <title>HiQuE: Hierarchical Question Embedding Network for Multimodal Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization of automated depression detection significantly enhances early intervention for individuals experiencing depression. Despite numerous proposals on automated depression detection using recorded clinical interview videos, limited attention has been paid to considering the hierarchical structure of the interview questions. In clinical interviews for diagnosing depression, clinicians use a structured questionnaire that includes routine baseline questions and follow-up questions to assess the interviewee's condition. This paper introduces HiQuE (Hierarchical Question Embedding network), a novel depression detection framework that leverages the hierarchical relationship between primary and follow-up questions in clinical interviews. HiQuE can effectively capture the importance of each question in diagnosing depression by learning mutual information across multiple modalities. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used clinical interview data, DAIC-WOZ, where our model outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal depression detection models and emotion recognition models, showcasing its clinical utility in depression detection.</description>

      <title>Identity-Driven Multimedia Forgery Detection via Reference Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in "deepfake" techniques have paved the way for generating various media forgeries. In response to the potential hazards of these media forgeries, many researchers engage in exploring detection methods, increasing the demand for high-quality media forgery datasets. Despite this, existing datasets have certain limitations. Firstly, most datasets focus on manipulating visual modality and usually lack diversity, as only a few forgery approaches are considered. Secondly, the quality of media is often inadequate in clarity and naturalness. Meanwhile, the size of the dataset is also limited. Thirdly, it is commonly observed that real-world forgeries are motivated by identity, yet the identity information of the individuals portrayed in these forgeries within existing datasets remains under-explored. For detection, identity information could be an essential clue to boost performance. Moreover, official media concerning relevant identities on the Internet can serve as prior knowledge, aiding both the audience and forgery detectors in determining the true identity. Therefore, we propose an identity-driven multimedia forgery dataset, IDForge, which contains 249,138 video shots sourced from 324 wild videos of 54 celebrities collected from the Internet. The fake video shots involve 9 types of manipulation across visual, audio, and textual modalities. Additionally, IDForge provides extra 214,438 real video shots as a reference set for the 54 celebrities. Correspondingly, we propose the Reference-assisted Multimodal Forgery Detection Network (R-MFDN), aiming at the detection of deepfake videos. Through extensive experiments on the proposed dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of R-MFDN on the multimedia detection task.</description>

      <title>New Job, New Gender? Measuring the Social Bias in Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent advancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and Midjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their impressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making them susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and biases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias within image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including limited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel evaluation framework that can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in image generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of individuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using gender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39 activities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then compares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on the significant changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a key insight that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to neutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social bias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. We use BiasPainter to evaluate six widely-used image generation models, such as stable diffusion and Midjourney. Experimental results show that BiasPainter can successfully trigger social bias in image generation models. According to our human evaluation, BiasPainter can achieve 90.8% accuracy on automatic bias detection, which is significantly higher than the results reported in previous work.</description>

      <title>Contextual Cross-Modal Attention for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the digital age, the emergence of deepfakes and synthetic media presents a significant threat to societal and political integrity. Deepfakes based on multi-modal manipulation, such as audio-visual, are more realistic and pose a greater threat. Current multi-modal deepfake detectors are often based on the attention-based fusion of heterogeneous data streams from multiple modalities. However, the heterogeneous nature of the data (such as audio and visual signals) creates a distributional modality gap and poses a significant challenge in effective fusion and hence multi-modal deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal attention framework based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that leverages contextual information for audio-visual deepfake detection. The proposed approach applies attention to multi-modal multi-sequence representations and learns the contributing features among them for deepfake detection and localization. Thorough experimental validations on audio-visual deepfake datasets, namely FakeAVCeleb, AV-Deepfake1M, TVIL, and LAV-DF datasets, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Cross-comparison with the published studies demonstrates superior performance of our approach with an improved accuracy and precision by 3.47% and 2.05% in deepfake detection and localization, respectively. Thus, obtaining state-of-the-art performance. To facilitate reproducibility, the code and the datasets information is available at https://github.com/vcbsl/audiovisual-deepfake/.</description>

      <title>SynopGround: A Large-Scale Dataset for Multi-Paragraph Video Grounding from TV Dramas and Synopses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video grounding is a fundamental problem in multimodal content understanding, aiming to localize specific natural language queries in an untrimmed video. However, current video grounding datasets merely focus on simple events and are either limited to shorter videos or brief sentences, which hinders the model from evolving toward stronger multimodal understanding capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a large-scale video grounding dataset named SynopGround, in which more than 2800 hours of videos are sourced from popular TV dramas and are paired with accurately localized human-written synopses. Each paragraph in the synopsis serves as a language query and is manually annotated with precise temporal boundaries in the long video. These paragraph queries are tightly correlated to each other and contain a wealth of abstract expressions summarizing video storylines and specific descriptions portraying event details, which enables the model to learn multimodal perception on more intricate concepts over longer context dependencies. Based on the dataset, we further introduce a more complex setting of video grounding dubbed Multi-Paragraph Video Grounding (MPVG), which takes as input multiple paragraphs and a long video for grounding each paragraph query to its temporal interval. In addition, we propose a novel Local-Global Multimodal Reasoner (LGMR) to explicitly model the local-global structures of long-term multimodal inputs for MPVG. Our method provides an effective baseline solution to the multi-paragraph video grounding problem. Extensive experiments verify the proposed model's effectiveness as well as its superiority in long-term multi-paragraph video grounding over prior state-of-the-arts. Dataset and code are publicly available. Project page: https://synopground.github.io/.</description>
