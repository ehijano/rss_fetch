      <title>Permanental rank versus determinantal rank of random matrices over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by basic complexity and probability questions about permanents of random matrices over finite fields, and in particular, about properties separating the permanent and the determinant. Fix $q = p^m$ some power of an odd prime, and let $k \leq n$ both be growing. For a uniformly random $n \times k$ matrix $A$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, we study the probability that all $k \times k$ submatrices of $A$ have zero permanent; namely that $A$ does not have full "permanental rank". When $k = n$, this is simply the probability that a random square matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ has zero permanent, which we do not understand. We believe that the probability in this case is $\frac{1}{q} + o(1)$, which would be in contrast to the case of the determinant, where the answer is $\frac{1}{q} + \Omega_q(1)$. Our main result is that when $k$ is $O(\sqrt{n})$, the probability that a random $n \times k$ matrix does not have full permanental rank is essentially the same as the probability that the matrix has a $0$ column, namely $(1 +o(1)) \frac{k}{q^n}$. In contrast, for determinantal (standard) rank the analogous probability is $\Theta(\frac{q^k}{q^n})$. At the core of our result are some basic linear algebraic properties of the permanent that distinguish it from the determinant.</description>

      <title>Computing Equilibrium Points of Electrostatic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computation of equilibrium points of electrostatic potentials: locations in space where the electrostatic force arising from a collection of charged particles vanishes. This is a novel scenario of optimization in which solutions are guaranteed to exist due to a nonconstructive argument, but gradient descent is unreliable due to the presence of singularities.
  We present an algorithm based on piecewise approximation of the potential function by Taylor series. The main insight is to divide the domain into a grid with variable coarseness, where grid cells are exponentially smaller in regions where the function changes rapidly compared to regions where it changes slowly. Our algorithm finds approximate equilibrium points in time poly-logarithmic in the approximation parameter, but these points are not guaranteed to be close to exact solutions. Nevertheless, we show that such points can be computed efficiently under a mild assumption that we call "strong non-degeneracy". We complement these algorithmic results by studying a generalization of this problem and showing that it is CLS-hard and in PPAD, leaving its precise classification as an intriguing open problem.</description>

      <title>New Perspectives on Semiring Applications to Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiring algebras have been shown to provide a suitable language to formalize many noteworthy combinatorial problems. For instance, the Shortest-Path problem can be seen as a special case of the Algebraic-Path problem when applied to the tropical semiring. The application of semirings typically makes it possible to solve extended problems without increasing the computational complexity. In this article we further exploit the idea of using semiring algebras to address and tackle several extensions of classical computational problems by dynamic programming. We consider a general approach which allows us to define a semiring extension of any problem with a reasonable notion of a certificate (e.g., an NP problem). This allows us to consider cost variants of these combinatorial problems, as well as their counting extensions where the goal is to determine how many solutions a given problem admits. The approach makes no particular assumptions (such as idempotence) on the semiring structure. We also propose a new associative algebraic operation on semirings, called $\Delta$-product, which enables our dynamic programming algorithms to count the number of solutions of minimal costs. We illustrate the advantages of our framework on two well-known but computationally very different NP-hard problems, namely, Connected-Dominating-Set problems and finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). In particular, we prove fixed parameter tractability (FPT) with respect to clique-width and tree-width of the input. This also allows us to count solutions of minimal cost, which is an overlooked problem in the literature.</description>

      <title>Oracle Separations for the Quantum-Classical Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum-classical polynomial hierarchy, QCPH, which is the class of languages solvable by a constant number of alternating classical quantifiers followed by a quantum verifier. Our main result is that QCPH is infinite relative to a random oracle (previously, this was not even known relative to any oracle). We further prove that higher levels of PH are not contained in lower levels of QCPH relative to a random oracle; this is a strengthening of the somewhat recent result that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle (Rossman, Servedio, and Tan 2016).
  The oracle separation requires lower bounding a certain type of low-depth alternating circuit with some quantum gates. To establish this, we give a new switching lemma for quantum algorithms which may be of independent interest. Our lemma says that for any $d$, if we apply a random restriction to a function $f$ with quantum query complexity $\mathrm{Q}(f)\le n^{1/3}$, the restricted function becomes exponentially close (in terms of $d$) to a depth-$d$ decision tree. Our switching lemma works even in a "worst-case" sense, in that only the indices to be restricted are random; the values they are restricted to are chosen adversarially. Moreover, the switching lemma also works for polynomial degree in place of quantum query complexity.</description>

      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Subset Sum: An Adaptive, Structure-Aware Solver with Sub-$2^{n/2}$ Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Subset Sum problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ integers has a subset summing to a target $t$, is a fundamental NP-complete problem in cryptography and combinatorial optimization. The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains the best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed by $U = |\Sigma(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums.
  We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the distinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and online modes.
  To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a Controlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a fixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, strictly improving upon classical bounds.
  Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured inputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants, duplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic programming performance. We conclude by outlining how this adaptive framework can be extended to other NP-complete problems.</description>
