      <title>Changing topological type of compression bodies through cone manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generically, small deformations of cone manifold holonomy groups have wildly uncontrolled global geometry. We give a short concrete example showing that it is possible to deform complete hyperbolic metrics on a thickened genus $2$ surface to complete hyperbolic metrics on the genus two handlebody with a single unknotted cusp drilled out via cone manifolds of prescribed singular structure. In other words, there exists a method to construct smooth curves in the character variety of $ \pi_1(S_{2,0}) $ which join open sets parameterising discrete groups (quasi-conformal deformation spaces) through indiscrete groups where the indiscreteness arises in a very controlled, local, way: a cone angle increasing along a fixed singular locus.</description>

      <title>CAT(0) geometry of complex curve complements and families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of whether braid groups are CAT(0), we investigate the CAT(0) behavior of fundamental groups of plane curve complements and certain universal families. If $C$ is the branch locus of a generic projection of a smooth, complete intersection surface to $\PP^2$, we show that $\pi_1(\PP^2\setminus C)$ is CAT(0). In the other direction, we prove that the fundamental group of the universal family associated with the singularities of type $E_6$, $E_7$, and $E_8$ is not CAT(0).</description>

      <title>Periodic symplectic and Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on irrational ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extension of homologically trivial symplectic or Hamiltonian cyclic actions to Hamiltonian circle actions on irrational ruled symplectic $4$-manifolds. On one hand, we construct symplectic involutions on minimal irrational ruled $4$-manifolds that cannot extend to a symplectic circle action even with a possibly different symplectic form. Higher dimensional examples are also constructed. On the other hand, for homologically trivial symplectic cyclic actions of any other order, we show that such an extension always exists.
  We also classify finite groups of symplecticmorphisms that acts trivially on the first homology group, and prove the non-extendability of the Klein $4$-group action to the three dimensional rotation group action motivated by the classification of finite groups of symplectomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Gassner and Burau representations over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two classical representations of Artin's braid group and their modulo $p$ reductions. We use topological methods to show that the Gassner representation $\tau_n: B_n\to\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t_1^{\pm 1}, \ldots, t_n^{\pm 1}])$ is faithful for all $n$, and furthermore that it is faithful modulo $p$ for all integers $p&gt;1$. We then give a novel proof that the Burau representation of $B_3$ is faithful modulo $p$ for all $p&gt;1$, and suggest applications to the modulo $p$ Burau representation for higher braid groups.</description>

      <title>Medial quandles's capability of detecting causality and properties of their coloring on certain links and knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04477v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigated the capability of medial quandle, quandle whose operation satisfying that $(a_1*b_1)*(a_2*b_2)=(a_1*a_2)*(b_1*b_2)$, to detect causality in (2+1)-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime by determining if they can distinguished the connected sum of two Hopf links from an infinite series of relevant three-component links constructed by Allen and Swenberg in 2020, who suggested that any link invariant must be able to distinguish those links for them to detect causality in the given setting. I show that these quandles fail to do so as long as $a\sim b\Leftrightarrow a*b=a$ defines an equivalence relation. The Alexander quandles is an example that this result can apply to. Inspired by this result, I also derived a generalized theorem about the coloring of medial quandles on a specific type of tangles, which help to determine whether this quandles can distinguish between a wider range of knots and links or not.</description>

      <title>On a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morse functions are important objects and tools in understanding topologies of manifolds since the 20th century. Their classification has been natural and difficult problems, and surprisingly, this is recently developing. Since the 2010's, results for cases of surfaces have been presented by Gelbukh, Marzantowicz and Michalak for example. We have also longed for higher dimensional cases. We present a classification of Morse functions on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of manifolds of Heegaard genus one. We concentrate on Morse functions such that preimages of single points containing no singular points are disjoint unions of spheres and tori. Existence of such functions implies that the $3$-dimensional closed and connected manifolds are of such manifolds. This has been shown by Saeki in 2006 and we further study structures of these functions.</description>

      <title>Skein valued cluster transformation in enumerative geometry of Legendrian mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under certain hypotheses, we show that Legendrian surfaces related by disk surgery will have q-deformed augmentation spaces that are related by q-deformed cluster transformation. The proof is geometric, via considerations of moduli of holomorphic curves. In fact, our results naturally give a more general HOMFLYPT "skein-valued cluster transformation", of which the q-cluster transformation is the U(1) specialization.
  We apply our methods to the Legendrians associated to cubic planar graphs, where mutation of graphs lifts to Legendrian disk surgery. We show that their skein-valued mirrors transform by skein-valued cluster transformation, and give a formula for the skein-valued curve counts on their fillings.</description>

      <title>Geometrical finiteness for automorphism groups via cone conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish the geometrical finiteness for the natural isometric actions of (birational) automorphism groups on the hyperbolic spaces for K3 surfaces, Enriques surfaces, Coble surfaces, and irreducible symplectic varieties.
  As an application, it follows that such groups are non-positively curved: ${\rm CAT(0)}$ and relatively hyperbolic. In the case of K3 surfaces, we provide a dynamical characterization of relative hyperbolicity, and clarify the relationship between convex-cocompactness and genus one fibrations.</description>
