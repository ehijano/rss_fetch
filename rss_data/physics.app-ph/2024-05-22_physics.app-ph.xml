      <title>Cross-disciplinary Reactor-to-Repository Framework for Evaluating Spent Nuclear Fuel from Advanced Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a cross-disciplinary reactor-to-repository framework to compare different advanced reactors with respect to their spent nuclear fuel (SNF). The framework consists of (1) OpenMC for simulating neutronics, fuel depletion, and radioactive decays; (2) NWPY for computing the repository footprint for SNF disposal given the thermal constraints; and (3) PFLOTRAN for simulating radionuclide transport in the geosphere to compute the peak dose rate, which is used to quantify the repository performance and environmental impact. We first perform the meta-analysis of past comparative analyses to identify the factors led previously to inconsistent conclusions. We then demonstrate the new framework by comparing five reactor types. Significant findings are that (1) the repository footprint is neither linearly related to SNF volume nor to decay heat, due to the repository's thermal constraint, (2) fast reactors have significantly higher I-129 inventory, which is often the primarily dose contributor from repositories, and (3) the repository performance primarily depends on the waste forms. The TRISO-based reactors, in particular, have significantly higher SNF volumes, but result in smaller repository footprints and lower peak dose rates. Our analysis highlights the diversity of these reactors, each of which should be evaluated individually. The open-source framework ensures proper cross-disciplinary connections between reactor simulations and environmental assessments, as well as the transparency/traceability required for such comparative analyses. It aims to support reactor designers, repository developers and policy makers in evaluating the impact of different reactor designs, with the ultimate goal of improving the sustainability of nuclear energy systems.</description>

      <title>Pick-and-place transfer of arbitrary-metal electrodes for van der Waals device fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals electrode integration is a promising strategy to create near-perfect interfaces between metals and two-dimensional materials, with advantages such as eliminating Fermi-level pinning and reducing contact resistance. However, the lack of a simple, generalizable pick-and-place transfer technology has greatly hampered the wide use of this technique. We demonstrate the pick-and-place transfer of pre-fabricated electrodes from reusable polished hydrogenated diamond substrates without the use of any surface treatments or sacrificial layers. The technique enables transfer of large-scale arbitrary metal electrodes, as demonstrated by successful transfer of eight different elemental metals with work functions ranging from 4.22 to 5.65 eV. The mechanical transfer of metal electrodes from diamond onto van der Waals materials creates atomically smooth interfaces with no interstitial impurities or disorder, as observed with cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. As a demonstration of its device application, we use the diamond-transfer technique to create metal contacts to monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors with high-work-function Pd, low-work-function Ti, and semi metal Bi to create n- and p-type field-effect transistors with low Schottky barrier heights. We also extend this technology to other applications such as ambipolar transistor and optoelectronics, paving the way for new device architectures and high-performance devices.</description>

      <title>Beyond Lithium-Ion Batteries: Are Effective Electrodes Possible for Alkaline and Other Alkali Elements? Exploring Ion Intercalation in Surface-Modified Few-Layer Graphene and Examining Layer Quantity and Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest for better energy storage solutions, the role of designing effective electrodes is crucial. Previous research has shown that using materials like single-side fluorinated graphene can improve the stability of ion insertion in few-layer graphene (FLG), which is vital as we move beyond lithium-ion batteries. Alternatives such as sodium and potassium, which are more abundant on Earth, appear promising, but thorough studies on how these ions insert into electrodes in stages are still needed. Our research focuses on the initial three alkali (Li, Na, K) and alkaline (Be, Mg, Ca) earth metals. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with advanced calculations, we've investigated how these ions interact with modified graphene at various stages of insertion. This method provides more precise electrical data and has helped us understand the complex interactions involved. Specifically, we found a new site for ion insertion that is energetically favorable. We also explored how modifying the graphene surface affects ions of different sizes and charges and examined how the number of graphene layers influences these interactions. Our discoveries are crucial for developing new materials that could replace lithium-ion batteries and provide a foundation for adjusting electrical properties in battery design through ion staging and surface modifications.</description>

      <title>A silicon photonics waveguide-coupled colloidal quantum dot photodiode sensitive beyond 1.6 um</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics faces a persistent challenge in extending photodetection capabilities beyond the 1.6 um wavelength range, primarily due to the lack of appropriate epitaxial materials. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) present a promising solution here, offering distinct advantages such as infrared wavelength tunability, cost-effectiveness, and facile deposition. Their unique properties position them as a potential candidate for enabling photodetection in silicon photonics beyond the conventional telecom wavelength, thereby expanding the potential applications and capabilities within this domain. In this study, we have successfully integrated lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) onto silicon waveguides using standard process techniques. The integrated photodiodes exhibit a remarkable responsivity of 1.3 A/W (with an external quantum efficiency of 74.8%) at a wavelength of 2.1 um, a low dark current of only 106 nA and a bandwidth of 1.1 MHz under a -3 V bias. To demonstrate the scalability of our integration approach, we have developed a compact 8-channel spectrometer incorporating an array of QDPDs. This achievement marks a significant step toward realizing a cost-effective photodetector solution for silicon photonics, particularly tailored for a wide range of sensing applications around the 2 um wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Molecule-induced surface second-order nonlinearity in an inversion symmetric microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inversion symmetry eliminates the second-order nonlinear responses in materials commonly used in silicon photonics with electric-dipole approximation. The lack of effective methods to induce the second-order nonlinearity in silicon photonic materials prevents their applications in second-order nonlinear integrated photonics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a surface second-order nonlinear optics approach for boosting the second harmonic (SH) generation process in a silica microcavity. By leveraging the molecule-induced surface second-order nonlinearity, a record high SH efficiency of about 6.7% W-1 is achieved in a silica microcavity functionalized with a surface asymmetrically-aligned molecular monolayer, which is enhanced of two to four orders of magnitude compared to that before molecule-functionalization. Furthermore, we derive the equations that govern the surface second-order nonlinear process in inversion symmetric microcavities. Our method not only enables high efficiency second-order nonlinear frequency conversions in silica photonics, but also can apply to other inversion symmetric material platforms for integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>The hBN defects database: a theoretical compilation of color centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become an intensively researched system due to their potential applications in quantum technologies. There has been a large variety of defects being fabricated, yet, for many of them, the atomic origin remains unclear. The direct imaging of the defect is technically very challenging, in particular since, in a diffraction-limited spot, there are many defects and then one has to identify the one that is optically active. Another approach is to compare the photophysical properties with theoretical simulations and identify which defect has a matching signature. It has been shown that a single property for this is insufficient and causes misassignments. Here, we publish a density functional theory (DFT)-based searchable online database covering the electronic structure of hBN defects (257 triplet and 211 singlet configurations), as well as their photophysical fingerprint (excited state lifetime, quantum efficiency, transition dipole moment and orientation, polarization visibility, and many more). All data is open-source and publicly accessible at https://h-bn.info and can be downloaded. It is possible to enter the experimentally observed defect signature and the database will output possible candidates which can be narrowed down by entering as many observed properties as possible. The database will be continuously updated with more defects and new photophysical properties (which can also be specifically requested by any users). The database therefore allows one to reliably identify defects but also investigate which defects might be promising for magnetic field sensing or quantum memory applications.</description>

      <title>Predictive design of two-dimensional electrides with tunable magnetic, topological, and superconducting properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are of interest for their exotic properties, for example, superconductivity, and highly tunability. Focusing on phonon-mediating superconductivity, one would propose to promote critical temperature by substituting heavy elements by lighter ones, in order to increase Debye temperature. Following recent experimental progress in transition-metal nitrides and theoretically revealing W$_2$N$_3$ as a candidate for high-temperature superconductivity, we investigate the possibility of two-dimensional superconductivity through surface engineering on MoN$_2$. Using density functional theory calculation, we found multigap superconductivity at temperature up to 36K within anisotropic Eliashberg equation in passivated electride-like surfaces. We also demonstrate their possibility to sustain topological superconductivity with strong spin-orbital coupling.</description>

      <title>Inadequacy of equivalent circuits in nonlinear systems with inherent memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Basic multimode impedance analysis grounded in the availability of nonequilibrium charge carriers and their retarded path towards equilibrium is used to access the inadequacy of equivalent circuits in nonlinear systems with inherent memory. On the basic grounds of generation and recombination (or trapping) of nonequilibrium carriers and their relaxation times, we show how seeming complexity of frequency-dependent impedance that matches a vast universe of experimental evidences can be reduced to simple combinations of basic microscopic ingredients. Counterintuitive features such as a negative capacitances or unexpected inductances become a metaphoric construction with poor physical meaning, pointing to the limitations and ambiguities of the symbolic nature of ``equivalent'' circuits. Our approach further provides a microscopic perspective that exposes the linkage of an apparent flux with an apparent inductance dismissing any magnetic essence.</description>

      <title>Simple arithmetic operation in latent space can generate a novel three dimensional graph metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-based design strategies for metamaterials have revolutionized the creation of customizable architectures spanning nano- to macro-scale dimensions, achieving unprecedented mechanical behaviors that surpass the inherent properties of the constituent materials. However, the growing complexity of these methods poses challenges in generating diverse metamaterials without substantial human and computational resources, hindering widespread adoption. Addressing this, our study introduces an innovative design strategy capable of generating various three-dimensional graph metamaterials using simple arithmetic operations within the latent space. By seamlessly integrating hidden representations of disentangled latent space and latent diffusion processes, our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of complex design spaces, generating diverse graph metamaterials through arithmetic operations. This methodology stands as a versatile tool for creating structures ranging from repetitive lattice structures to functionally graded mechanical metamaterials. It also serves as an inverse design strategy for diverse lattice structures, including crystalline structures and those made of trabecular bone. We believe that this methodology represents a foundational step in advancing our comprehension of the intricate latent design space, offering the potential to establish a unified model for various traditional generative models in the realm of mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Laser Offset Stabilization with Chip-Scale Atomic Diffractive Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving precise and adjustable control over laser frequency is an essential requirement in numerous applications such as precision spectroscopy, quantum control, and sensing. In many such applications it is desired to stabilize a laser with a variable detuning from an atomic line. In this study, we employ an offset-stabilization scheme by utilizing phase contrast spectroscopy in microfabricated atomic diffractive elements vapor-cells. The spectroscopic response of such a device generates oscillating optical fringes, providing multiple optical frequency stabilization points across a bandwidth of tens of gigahertz, centered around the absorption resonances of Rb. Using this device, we demonstrate laser stabilization at various offset frequencies with instabilities reaching sub-megahertz levels. We further explore the fundamental limitations of our hybrid atomic-photonic device, drawing parallels to birefringent and dichroic spectroscopy apparatuses, which are commonly employed for offset stabilization. Our system showcases a broad offset lock bandwidth, a highly compact footprint, scalability to chip-scale production, and the ability to operate without reliance on magnetic fields. These attributes pave the way for a multitude of applications in quantum technologies.</description>
