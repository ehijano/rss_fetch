      <title>Sign changes of the thermoelectric transport coefficient across the metal-insulator crossover in the doped Fermi Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the doping-dependence of the Seebeck coefficient, as calculated from the Kelvin formula, for the Fermi Hubbard model using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our key findings are: (1) Besides the expected hole to electron-like behavior change around half filling, we show that the additional sign change at an electronic density $n_s$ (and correspondingly a hole density $p_s$) is controlled by the opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states or compressibility and not by the pseudogap scale in the single particle density of states. (2) We find that $n_s(T,U)$ depends strongly on the interaction $U$ and shows an unusual non-monotonic dependence on temperature with a maximum at a temperature $T\approx t$, on the order of the hopping scale. (3) We identify local moment formation close to half filling as the main driver for the anomalous behavior of the thermoelectric transport coefficient.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the quantum critical line in the Schmid transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schmid predicted that a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase when the shunt resistance $R$ exceeds the resistance quantum $h/(4 e^ 2)$. Recent measurements and theoretical studies have sparked a debate on whether the location of this transition depends on the ratio between the Josephson and the charging energies. We employ a combination of multiple innovative analytical and numerical techniques, never before explicitly applied to this problem, to decisively demonstrate that the transition line between superconducting and insulating behavior is indeed independent of this energy ratio. First, we apply field-theory renormalization group methods and find that the $\beta$ function vanishes along the critical line up to the third order in the Josephson energy. We then identify a simple fermionic model that precisely captures the low-energy physics on the critical line, regardless of the energy ratio. This conformally invariant fermionic model is verified by comparing the expected spectrum with exact diagonalization calculations of the resistively shunted Josephson junction, showing excellent agreement even for moderate system sizes. Importantly, this identification provides a rigorous non-perturbative proof that the transition line is maintained at $R=h/(4 e^ 2)$ for all ratios of Josephson to charging energies. The line is further resilient to other ultraviolet cutoffs such as the plasma frequency of the resistive environment. Finally, we implement an adiabatic approach to validate the duality at large Josephson energy.</description>

      <title>Spectral evidence for NiPS3 as a Mott-Hubbard insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals trichalcogenide NiPS3 has attracted widespread attention due to its unique optical, magnetic, and electronic properties. The complexity of NiPS3 itself, however, has also led to ongoing debates regarding its characteristics such as the existence of self-doped ligand holes. In this study, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering have been applied to investigate the electronic structure of NiPS3. With the aid of theoretical calculations using the charge-transfer multiplet model, we provide experimental evidence for NiPS3 being a Mott-Hubbard insulator rather than a charge-transfer insulator. Moreover, we explain why some previous XAS studies have concluded that NiPS3 is a charge-transfer insulator by comparing surface and bulk sensitive spectra.</description>

      <title>Many-body effects on high-harmonic generation in Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how many-body effects associated with background spin dynamics control the high-harmonic generation (HHG) in Mott insulators by analyzing the two-leg ladder Hubbard model. Spin dynamics activated by the interchain hopping $t_y$ drastically modifies the HHG features. When two chains are decoupled ($t_y=0$), HHG originates from the dynamics of coherent doublon-holon pairs because of spin-charge separation. With increasing $t_y$, the doublon-holon pairs lose their coherence due to their interchain hopping and resultant spin-strings. Furthermore, the HHG signal from spin-polarons -- charges dressed by spin clouds -- leads to an additional plateau in the HHG spectrum. For large $t_y$, we identify unconventional HHG processes involving $three$ elementary excitations -- two polarons and one magnon. Our results demonstrate the nontrivial nature of HHG in strongly correlated systems, and its qualitative differences to conventional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Atypical antiferromagnetic ordering in single crystalline quasi-2D honeycomb magnet YbI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we study YbI$_3$, a quasi-2D layered material with Yb atoms arranged on an ideal honeycomb network of edge-sharing YbI$_6$ octahedra, analogous to the low-temperature phase of $\alpha-$RuCl$_3$. High quality single crystals of YbI$_3$ are grown from Yb and I as starting precursors, using the vapor transport technique. The grown crystals are characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, magnetization, and heat capacity probes. The crystal-field split ground state of Yb$^{3+}$ in \Yb~ is a well-isolated Kramers doublet with an effective moment $\rm J_{eff} = 1/2$. Upon cooling, the low-temperature heat capacity of \Yb~ reveals a broad peak at $\rm T_1 = 0.95$~K due to short-range ordering of the Yb moments, followed by a sharp peak at $\rm T_2 = T_N = 0.6$~K due to long-range ordering. The magnetic behavior is found to be weakly anisotropic with $\chi^\parallel &gt; \chi^\perp$, where $\chi^\parallel$ and $\chi^\perp$ refers to the in-plane ($H \parallel ab$) and out-of-plane ($H \perp ab$) susceptibilities. The 2~K isothermal magnetization saturates at $\rm \approx~1.5~\mu_B/Yb^{3+}$ (in-plane) and $\rm \approx~1~\mu_B/Yb^{3+}$ (out-of-plane), suggesting the anisotropy to be easy-plane type. Low-temperature heat capacity, well below T$_N$, is found to vary as T$^\alpha$ with $\alpha~\approx~2.5$, indicating a possible unconventional magnetic ground state for YbI$_3$.</description>

      <title>Supersolid Phase in the Diluted Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Holstein model on a square lattice at half-filling has a well-established finite temperature phase transition to an insulating state with long range charge density wave (CDW) order. Because this CDW formation suppresses pairing, a superconducting (SC) phase emerges only with doping. In this work, we study the effects of dilution of the local phonon degrees of freedom in the Holstein model while keeping the system at half filling. We find not only that the CDW remains present up to a dilution fraction $f \sim 0.15$, but also that long range pairing is stabilized with increasing $f$, resulting in a {\it supersolid} regime centered at $f \approx 0.10$, where long range diagonal and off-diagonal correlations coexist. Further dilution results in a purely SC phase, and ultimately in a normal metal. Our results provide a new route to the supersolid phase via the introduction of impurities at fixed positions which both increase quantum fluctuations and also are immune to the competing tendency to phase separation often observed in the doped case.</description>

      <title>Strange metal at van Hove singularity in magnetic heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors at the two-dimensional (2D) magnetic heterostructure interface between a normal metal and a magnetic insulator. The normal metal undergoes a Lifshitz transition with van Hove singularities (VHS) saddle points tuned onto the Fermi surface, which represents a convex-to-concave geometric transition of the 2D Fermi surface. By coupling to critical spin fluctuations via interfacial exchange interactions, we uncover a novel NFL phase at the VHS with the quasiparticle lifetime scaling as $\sim \omega^{1/2}$. This NFL feature dominates over the rest of the Fermi surface points in the low-energy limit. At finite energies, it crossovers to the marginal Fermi liquid. Importantly, we demonstrate the strange metal behaviors, that includes the linear-in-$T$ resistivity and the $T\ln (1/T)$ specific heat, already present with the spatially uniform interaction, which broadens the scenario in \href{https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abq6011}{Science {\bf 381}, 790 (2023)}. Furthermore, we propose the non-magnetic ARPES can directly probe the NFL features at heterostructure interface. Our findings explore the interplay of VHS in lower dimension, disorder and strong interactions, which paves a novel path to study the quantum critical phenomenon, 2D magnetism and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Competition of Exchange and Correlation Energies in Two-Dimensional $N$-component Electron Gas Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent observations of symmtry broken phases in lightly-doped multilayer graphene, we investigate magnetic phase transitions in a generalized electron gas model with four-component electron spin. This model simplifies the problem with a parabolic dispersion band, abstracting away the details of the graphene band structure to focus solely on the effects of the Coulomb interaction. We report four findings: 1) In the Hartree-Fock approximation, we observe that the paramagnetic state undergoes a sequence of density-driven, first-order phase transitions, progressively depopulating electrons from each spin component until achieving complete polarization within a very narrow density window where $1.2&lt;r_s&lt;2$ ($r_s$ being the electron gas parameter). 2) Further incorporating the correlation energy via the Bohm-Pines random-phase approximation shows that the cascade of transitions obtained within Hartree-Fock approximation is replaced by a single ferromagnetic phase transition at $r_s = 6.12$. 3) The disappearance of cascade is due to the correlation energy difference between the four-component paramagnetic state and symmetry-broken phases, which is nearly an order of magnitude more negative than the corresponding Hartree-Fock energy difference for $1.2 &lt; r_s &lt; 2$. 4) The transition from the paramagnetic state to the fully polarized state at $r_s=6.12$ is governed by the balance between exchange and correlation energies, a competition that cannot be captured by mean-field approximations to models featuring effective (density-dependent) delta-function interactions, such as the Stoner model. We use the insights from our model to comment on the phase diagram of multilayer graphene electron gas.</description>

      <title>System identification based on characteristic curves: a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier analysis for first-order nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02349v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the sinosoidal output response in power series (SORPS) formalism was presented for system identification and simulation. Based on the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), it establishes a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier series for a first-order nonlinear system [F. J. Gonzalez, Sci. Rep. 13, 1955, (2023)]. However, the system identification procedure discussed there, based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), presents the limitations of requiring a sinusoidal single tone for the dynamical variable and equally spaced time steps for the input-output dataset (DS). These limitations are here addressed by introducing a different approach: we use a power series-based model for system modeling using two hyperparameters $\hat{A}_0$ and $\hat{A}_1$ optimally defined depending on the DS. Overall, this work expands the applicability of the SORPS formalism to arbitrary DSs and represents a groundbreaking contribution for the concept of CCs. The method of CCs is complementary to the commonly used approaches of NARMAX-models and sparse regression techniques, which emphasize the estimation of the individual parameter values of the model. However, the CCs-based methods emphasize the computation of the CCs as a whole, thus presenting the advantages that the system identification is uniquely defined, and that it can be applied for any system without additional algebraic operations. Thus, the parsimonious principle defined by the NARMAX-philosophy is extended from the concept of a model with as few parameters as possible to the concept of finding the lowest model order that correctly describe the input-output DS. This opens up a wide variety of potential applications in vibration analysis, structural dynamics, viscoelastic materials, nonlinear electric circuits, voltammetry techniques, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Topological defects of 2+1D systems from line excitations in 3+1D bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence of topological phases suggests strong connections between the topological features in a d+1-dimensional bulk and the potentially gapless theory on the (d-1)+1-dimensional boundary. In 2+1D topological phases, a direct correspondence can exist between anyonic excitations in the bulk and the topological point defects/primary fields in the boundary 1+1D conformal field theory. In this paper, we study how line excitations in 3+1D topological phases become line defects in the boundary 2+1D theory using the Topological Holography/Symmetry Topological Field Theory framework. We emphasize the importance of "descendent" line excitations and demonstrate in particular the effect of the Majorana chain defect: it leads to a distinct loop condensed gapped boundary state of the 3+1D fermionic Z2 topological order, and leaves signatures in the 2+1D Majorana-cone critical theory that describes the transition between the two types of loop condensed boundaries. Effects of non-invertible line excitations, such as Cheshire strings, are also discussed in bosonic 3+1D topological phases and the corresponding 2+1D critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of nonreciprocal superconductors where inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, giving rise to an asymmetric energy dispersion. We demonstrate that nonreciprocal superconductivity can be detected by Andreev reflection. In particular, a transparent junction between a normal metal and a nonreciprocal superconductor generally exhibits an asymmetric current-voltage characteristic, which serves as a defining feature of nonreciprocal superconductivity. Unlike the superconducting diode effects, our detection scheme has the advantage of avoiding large critical currents that turn the superconducting state to normal. Finally, we discuss candidates for nonreciprocal superconductivity, including graphene, UTe2, as well as engineered platforms.</description>

      <title>Unconventional p-wave and finite-momentum superconductivity induced by altermagnetism through the formation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the Fulde-Ferrell state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in topological insulator nanowires proximitized by Nb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon that creates/detects Cooper-pair correlations between distant places. It is also the basis of Cooper-pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although CAR has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, it has been very difficult to observe it in a topological insulator (TI). Here we report the first observation of CAR in a proximitized TI nanowire (TINW). We performed local and nonlocal conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic TINW devices in which superconducting (Nb) and metallic (Pt/Au) contacts are made on a bulk-insulating TINW. The local conductance detected a hard gap, accompanied by the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero-bias, while a negative nonlocal conductance was occasionally observed upon sweeping the chemical potential, giving evidence for CAR. Surprisingly, the CAR signal was detected even over 1.5 $\mu$m, which implies that pair correlations extend over a length scale much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either Nb or the proximitised TINW. Such a long-range CAR effect is possibly due to an intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Also, our 0.9-$\mu$m device presented a decent Cooper-pair splitting efficiency of up to 0.5.</description>

      <title>Approximate symmetries, insulators, and superconductivity in continuum-model description of twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we analyze the correlated physics in this system in the framework of a continuum model for the moir\'e superlattice. Using the symmetries in a fine-tuned limit of the system, we identify the strong-coupling ground states and their fate when the perturbations caused by finite bandwidth, displacement field, and the phase of the intralayer potential are taken into account. We classify the superconducting instabilities and, employing a spin-fermion-like model, study the superconducting instabilities in proximity to these insulating particle-hole orders. This reveals that only a neighboring intervalley coherent phase (with zero or finite wave vector) is naturally consistent with the observed superconducting state. Depending on details, the superconductor will be nodal or a chiral gapped state while further including electron-phonon coupling leads to a fully gapped, time-reversal symmetric pairing state.</description>

      <title>Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of J_eff = 1/2 quantum antiferromagnet CeCl_3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report growth of high-quality single crystals of CeCl3 using a modified Bridgman Stockbarger method in an infrared image furnace. The grown crystals are characterized using single-crystal/powder X-ray diffraction, Laue X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, magnetization, and heat capacity probes. CeCl3 crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a weak trigonal distortion. The Raman spectrum at 300 K showcases five, clearly resolvable, phonon modes at 106.8, 181.2, 189, 213, and 219.7 wavenumbers. The magnetic susceptibility show a large anisotropy with a broad peak in the perpendicular orientation, which is explained using the crystal field theory. The crystal field in CeCl3 splits the J = 5/2 manifold of Ce3+ into three Kramers doublets, resulting in a well-isolated ground state. In the specific heat, no magnetic ordering is detected above 2 K. However, in non-zero fields the low-temperature specific heat changes dramatically, showcasing a peak at 2.5 K under a moderate field of 30 kOe. The weak Ce-Ce exchange, large Ce moment in the crystal field ground state, and significant anisotropy are ingredients for realizing a high magnetocaloric effect. A maximum entropy change of 23 J/Kg/K is observed near 2.5 K in fields ranging from 50 kOe to 60 kOe. These values are comparable to some of the best Gd-based magnetocaloric materials, signifying the potential of CeCl3 as a magnetic coolant.</description>

      <title>Self-learning Monte Carlo with equivariant Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning have revolutionized computational physics, particularly the simulation of complex systems. Equivariance is essential for simulating physical systems because it imposes a strong inductive bias on the probability distribution described by a machine learning model. However, imposing symmetry on the model can sometimes lead to poor acceptance rates in self-learning Monte Carlo (SLMC). Here, we introduce a symmetry equivariant attention mechanism for SLMC, which can be systematically improved. We evaluate our architecture on a spin-fermion model (\textit{i.e.}, double exchange model) on a two-dimensional lattice. Our results show that the proposed method overcomes the poor acceptance rates of linear models and exhibits a similar scaling law to large language models, with model quality monotonically increasing with the number of layers. Our work paves the way for the development of more accurate and efficient Monte Carlo algorithms with machine learning for simulating complex physical systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor network influence functionals in the continuous-time limit: connections to quantum embedding, bath discretization, and higher-order time propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe two developments of tensor network influence functionals (in particular, influence functional matrix product states (IF-MPS)) for quantum impurity dynamics within the fermionic setting of the Anderson impurity model. The first provides the correct extension of the IF-MPS to continuous time by introducing a related mathematical object, the boundary influence functional MPS. The second connects the dynamics described by a compressed IF-MPS to that of a quantum embedding method with a time-dependent effective bath undergoing nonunitary dynamics. Using these concepts, we implement higher-order time propagators for the quench dynamics of the Anderson impurity model within the boundary IF-MPS formalism. The calculations illustrate the ability of the current formulation to efficiently remove the time step error in standard discrete-time IF-MPS implementations as well as to interface with state vector propagation techniques. They also show the advantages of IF-MPS dynamics, with its associated highly compact effective bath dynamics, over state vector propagation with a static bath discretization.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillation study of the large magnetoresistance in Mo substituted WTe$_2$ single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The list of interesting electrical properties exhibited by transition metal dichalcogenides has grown with the discovery of extremely large magnetoresistance (MR) and type-II Weyl semimetal behaviour in WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$. The extremely large MR in WTe$_2$ is still not adequately understood. Here, we systematically study the effect of Mo substitution on the quantum oscillations in the MR in WTe$_2$. The MR decreases with Mo substitution, however, the carrier concentrations extracted from the quantum oscillations show that the charge compensation improves. We believe that earlier interpretations based on the two-band theory, which attribute the decrease in MR to charge imbalance, could be incorrect due to over-parametrization. We attribute the decrease in MR in the presence of charge compensation to a fall in transport mobility, which is evident from the residual resistivity ratio data. The quantum scattering time and the effective masses do not change within experimental errors upon substitution.</description>

      <title>A new twist on the Majorana surface code: Bosonic and fermionic defects for fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are promising candidates for topologically-protected quantum computing hardware, however their large-scale use will likely require quantum error correction. Majorana surface codes (MSCs) have been proposed to achieve this. However, many MSC properties remain unexplored. We present a unified framework for MSC "twist defects" $\unicode{x2013}$ anyon-like objects encoding quantum information. We show that twist defects in MSCs can encode twice the amount of topologically protected information as in qubit-based codes or other MSC encoding schemes. This is due to twists encoding both logical qubits and "logical MZMs," with the latter enhancing the protection microscopic MZMs can offer. We explain how to perform universal computation with logical qubits and logical MZMs while potentially using far fewer resources than in other MSC schemes. All Clifford gates can be implemented on logical qubits by braiding twist defects. We introduce lattice-surgery-based techniques for computing with logical MZMs and logical qubits, achieving the effect of Clifford gates with zero time overhead. We also show that logical MZMs may result in improved spatial overheads for sufficiently low rates of quasi-particle poisoning. Finally, we introduce a novel MSC analogue of transversal gates that achieves encoded Clifford gates in small codes by braiding microscopic MZMs. MSC twist defects thus open new paths towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Interactions enable Thouless pumping in a nonsliding lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological 'Thouless' pump represents the quantised motion of particles in response to a slow, cyclic modulation of external control parameters. The Thouless pump, like the quantum Hall effect, is of fundamental interest in physics because it links physically measurable quantities, such as particle currents, to geometric properties of the experimental system, which can be robust against perturbations and thus technologically useful. So far, experiments probing the interplay between topology and inter-particle interactions have remained relatively scarce. Here we observe a Thouless-type charge pump in which the particle current and its directionality inherently rely on the presence of strong interactions. Experimentally, we utilise a two-component Fermi gas in a dynamical superlattice which does not exhibit a sliding motion and remains trivial in the single-particle regime. However, when tuning interparticle interactions from zero to positive values, the system undergoes a transition from being stationary to drifting in one direction, consistent with quantised pumping in the first cycle. Remarkably, the topology of the interacting pump trajectory cannot be adiabatically connected to a non-interacting limit, highlighted by the fact that only one atom is transferred per cycle. Our experiments suggest that Thouless charge pumps are promising platforms to gain insights into interaction-driven topological transitions and topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Linear-T Resistivity from Spatially Random Vector Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Patel et.al introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar with vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector as well as scalar interaction, although the details are very different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimension not in higher dimension independent of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the role of spatial random disorder and find a simple understanding how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to the strange metal by changing the behavior of the self-energies of involved boson and fermion.</description>
