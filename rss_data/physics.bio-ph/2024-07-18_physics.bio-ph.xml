      <title>A statistical mechanics investigation of Unfolded Protein Response across organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems rely on coordinated molecular interactions, especially those related to gene expression and protein activity. The Unfolded Protein Response is a crucial mechanism in eukaryotic cells, activated when unfolded proteins exceed a critical threshold. It maintains cell homeostasis by enhancing protein folding, initiating quality control, and activating degradation pathways when damage is irreversible. This response functions as a dynamic signaling network, with proteins as nodes and their interactions as edges. We analyze these protein-protein networks across different organisms to understand their intricate intra-cellular interactions and behaviors. In this work, analyzing twelve organisms, we assess how fundamental measures in network theory can individuate seed-proteins and specific pathways across organisms. We employ network robustness to evaluate and compare the strength of the investigated PPI networks, and the structural controllability of complex networks to find and compare the sets of driver nodes necessary to control the overall networks. We find that network measures are related to phylogenetics, and advanced network methods can identify main pathways of significance in the complete Unfolded Protein Response mechanism.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with commercially available finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cellular nematic order is a conserved feature of gastrulation in animal embryos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells undergo dramatic changes in morphology during embryogenesis, yet how these changes affect the formation of ordered tissues remains elusive. Here we find that the emergence of a nematic liquid crystal phase occurs in cells during gastrulation in the development of embryos of fish, frogs, and fruit flies. Moreover, the spatial correlations in all three organisms are long-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~$x^{-\alpha}$ ) with $\alpha$ less than unity for the nematic order parameter, suggesting a common underlying physical mechanism unifies events in these distantly related species. All three species exhibit similar propagation of the nematic phase, reminiscent of nucleation and growth phenomena. Finally, we use a theoretical model along with disruptions of cell adhesion and cell specification to characterize the minimal features required for formation of the nematic phase. Our results provide a framework for understanding a potentially universal features of metazoan embryogenesis and shed light on the advent of ordered structures during animal development.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy with Machine Learning for Advanced Analysis of Anomalous Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random motion of molecules in living cells has consistently been reported to deviate from standard Brownian motion, a behavior coined as ``anomalous diffusion''. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful method to quantify molecular motions in living cells but its application is limited to a subset of random motions and to long acquisition times. Here, we propose a new analysis approach that frees FCS of these limitations by using machine learning to infer the underlying model of motion and estimate the motion parameters. Using simulated FCS recordings, we show that this approach enlarges the range of anomalous motions available in FCS. We further validate our approach via experimental FCS recordings of calibrated fluorescent beads in increasing concentrations of glycerol in water. Taken together, our approach significantly augments the analysis power of FCS to capacities that are similar to the best-in-class state-of-the-art algorithms for single-particle-tracking experiments.</description>

      <title>Searching for long time scales without fine tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of animal and human behavior occurs on time scales much longer than the response times of individual neurons. In many cases it is plausible that these long time scales emerge from the recurrent dynamics of electrical activity in networks of neurons. In linear models, time scales are set by the eigenvalues of a dynamical matrix whose elements measure the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons. It is not clear to what extent these matrix elements need to be tuned in order to generate long time scales; in some cases, one needs not just a single long time scale but a whole range. Starting from the simplest case of random symmetric connections, we combine maximum entropy and random matrix theory methods to construct ensembles of networks, exploring the constraints required for long time scales to become generic. We argue that a single long time scale can emerge generically from realistic constraints, but a full spectrum of slow modes requires more tuning. Langevin dynamics that will generate patterns of synaptic connections drawn from these ensembles involve a combination of Hebbian learning and activity-dependent synaptic scaling.</description>

      <title>An Open-Ended Approach to Understanding Local, Emergent Conservation Laws in Biological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While fields like Artificial Life have made huge strides in quantifying the mechanisms that distinguish living systems from non-living ones, particular mechanisms remain difficult to reproduce in silico. Known as open-endedness, we've been successful in finding mechanisms that generate new states, but have been less successful in finding mechanisms that generate new rules. Here, we weigh whether or not analyzing the effects of internal and external system constraints on a system's dynamics would be a fruitful avenue to understanding open-endedness. We discuss the connection between physical constraints and the ways that the system can physically reach possible states while those constraints are present. It seems that the physical constraints that define biological objects (and dynamics) are maintained by dynamics that occur from within the system. This is in opposition to current modeling approaches where system constraints are maintained externally. We suggest that constraints can be characterized as variables whose values are either completely conserved, quasi-conserved, or conditionally conserved. Regardless of whether or not a constrained variable is a part of the biological object or present in the object's environment, we discuss how the accessible system states under that constraint can lead to local, emergent conservation laws (rules), with examples. Finally, we discuss the possible benefits of formally understanding how system constraints that emerge from within a system lead to system dynamics that can be characterized as new, emergent rules -- particularly for artificial intelligence, hybrid life, embodiment, astrobiology, and more. Understanding how new, local rules might emerge from within the system is crucial for understanding how open-ended systems continually discover new update rules, in addition to continually discovering new states.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of red blood cell aggregates in extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell aggregation. We investigate the dissociation rates of red cell aggregates in extensional flow using hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our findings reveal that aggregate dissociation increases sharply when a critical extension rate is reached which falls within the range of microcirculatory conditions, suggesting that large variations of aggregate sizes should be expected in-vivo. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of red blood cell aggregates in response to extensional stress in microcirculatory networks, provides crucial experimental data to validate theoretical and numerical models, and constitutes the basis for improved evaluation of blood aggregability in clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of the normalized mutual information of multidimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the linear Pearson correlation coefficient represents a well-established normalized measure to quantify the interrelation of two stochastic variables $X$ and $Y$, it fails for multidimensional variables such as Cartesian coordinates. Avoiding any assumption about the underlying data, the mutual information $I(X, Y)$ does account for multidimensional correlations. However, unlike the normalized Pearson correlation, it has no upper bound ($I \in [0, \infty)$), i.e., it is not clear if say, $I = 0.4$ corresponds to a low or a high correlation. Moreover, the mutual information (MI) involves the estimation of high-dimensional probability densities (e.g., six-dimensional for Cartesian coordinates), which requires a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, such as the estimator by Kraskov et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 066138 (2004)]. As existing methods to normalize the MI cannot be used in connection with this estimator, a new approach is presented, which uses an entropy estimation method that is invariant under variable transformations. The algorithm is numerically efficient and does not require more effort than the calculation of the (un-normalized) MI. After validating the method by applying it to various toy models, the normalized MI between the $C_{\alpha}$ -coordinates of T4 lysozyme is considered and compared to a correlation analysis of inter-residue contacts.</description>
