      <title>High-Stability Single-Ion Clock with $5.5\times10^{-19}$ Systematic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5 \times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$ $^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive mid-circuit measurement and reset on atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement and reset of subsets of qubits is a crucial ingredient of quantum error correction and many quantum information applications. Measurement of atomic qubits is accomplished through resonant fluorescence, which typically disturbs neighboring atoms due to photon scattering. We propose and prototype a new scheme for measurement that provides both spatial and spectral isolation by using tightly-focused individual laser beams and narrow atomic transitions. The unique advantage of this scheme is that all operations are applied exclusively to the read-out qubit, with negligible disturbance to the other qubits of the same species and little overhead. In this letter, we pave the way for non-invasive and high fidelity mid-circuit measurement and demonstrate all key building blocks on a single trapped barium ion.</description>

      <title>In-situ mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset in a single-species trapped-ion quantum computing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating data qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the metastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable state without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$ ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit. These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the architecture.</description>

      <title>Long-wavelength optical lattices from optical beatnotes: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of Beat-Note Superlattices (BNSLs), a recently demonstrated technique for generating periodic trapping potentials for ultracold atomic clouds, with arbitrarily large lattice spacings while maintaining interferometric stability. By combining two optical lattices with slightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed, generating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity equal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wavevectors of the two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under which this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against perturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer significant advantages in comparison to well established techniques for the manipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of BNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum-gas microscopy of the Bose-glass phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered potentials fundamentally alter the transport properties and coherence of quantum systems. They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved, reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with single-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of the Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Wafer-level fabrication of all-dielectric vapor cells enabling optically addressed Rydberg atom electrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg-atom electrometry enables highly sensitive electric-field measurements by exploiting the extreme polarizability of Rydberg states in alkali atoms. Millimeter-scale atomic vapor cells can be accurately and economically batch-fabricated by anodically bonding silicon and glass wafers, enabling the large-volume manufacturing of miniature atomic clocks and quantum sensors. However, silicon is not always an ideal constitutive material for electric-field sensing because of its high dielectric constant and conductive losses at millimeter wave frequencies. A broader selection of low-loss all-dielectric alternatives may be beneficial for specific applications. Here, we present an all-glass wafer-level microfabrication process that eliminates silicon, creating hermetically sealed vapor cells that are stable over long timelines with embedded cesium dispensers. Femtosecond laser machining precisely defines the cell geometry, and laser-activated alkali loading ensures reliable filling. We demonstrate long-term vacuum stability and robust Rydberg excitation through electromagnetically induced transparency measurements of several Rydberg states. We then use these cells to measure a 34 GHz millimeter wave field resonant with the 58D$_{5/2}\rightarrow$60P$_{3/2}$ transition using Autler-Townes splitting showing expected linear dependence with field strength. This work demonstrates that the all-glass approach offers a highly durable low-loss cell alternative for miniaturized millimeter wave and microwave quantum sensing, with the potential to flexibly incorporate a range of other dielectric and semiconductor materials and integrated photonic and electronic technologies.</description>
