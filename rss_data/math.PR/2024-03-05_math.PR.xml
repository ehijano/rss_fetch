      <title>Asymptotic expansion of the drift estimator for the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic expansion formula of an estimator for the drift coefficient of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As the machinery, we apply the general expansion scheme for Wiener functionals recently developed by the authors [26]. The central limit theorem in the principal part of the expansion has the classical scaling T^{1/2}. However, the asymptotic expansion formula is a complex in that the order of the correction term becomes the classical T^{-1/2} for H in (1/2,5/8), but T^{4H-3} for H in [5/8, 3/4).</description>

      <title>Curvature and Other Local Inequalities in Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the approach of Ivanisvili and Volberg towards functional inequalities for probability measures with strictly convex potentials, we investigate the relationship between curvature bounds in the sense of Bakry-Emery and local functional inequalities. We will show that not only is the earlier approach for strictly convex potentials extendable to Markov semigroups and simplified through use of the $\Gamma$-calculus, providing a consolidating machinery for obtaining functional inequalities new and old in this general setting, but that a converse also holds. Local inequalities obtained are proven equivalent to Bakry-Emery curvature. Moreover we will develop this technique for metric measure spaces satisfying the RCD condition, providing a unified approach to functional and isoperimetric inequalities in non-smooth spaces with a synthetic Ricci curvature bound. Finally, we are interested in commutation properties for semi-group operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the absence of positive curvature, based on a local eigenvalue criteria.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the colored ASEP and stochastic six-vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the colored asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and stochastic six vertex (S6V) model with fully packed initial conditions; the states of these models can be encoded by 2-parameter height functions. We show under Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling of time, space, and fluctuations that these height functions converge to the Airy sheet.
  Several corollaries follow. For ASEP and the S6V model under the basic coupling, we consider the 4-parameter height function at position $y$ and time $t$, with a step initial condition at position $x$ and time $s&lt;t$. Under KPZ scaling, we deduce its convergence to the directed landscape. We further prove that ASEPs under the basic coupling, with multiple general initial data, converge to KPZ fixed points coupled through the directed landscape. We moreover show that the colored ASEP stationary measures converge to the stationary horizon.
  The starting point for our Airy sheet convergence result is an embedding of these colored models into a larger structure -- a color-indexed family of coupled line ensembles with an explicit Gibbs property, i.e., a colored Hall-Littlewood line ensemble. The core of our work then becomes to develop a framework to analyze the edge scaling limit of these ensembles.</description>

      <title>Propagation of high peaks for the space-time fractional stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space-time nonlinear fractional stochastic heat equation driven by a space-time white noise,
  \begin{align*}
  \partial_t^\beta u(t,x)=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u(t,x)+I_t^{1-\beta}\Big[\sigma(u(t,x))\dot{W}(t,x)\Big],\ \ t&gt;0, \ x\in \mathbb{R} ,
  \end{align*}
  where $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a globally Lipschitz function and the initial condition is a measure on $\mathbb{R}.$ Under some growth conditions on $\sigma,$ we derive two important properties about the moments of the solution:
  (i) For $p\geq 2,$ the $p^{\text{th}}$ absolute moment of the solution to the equation above grows exponentially with time.
  (ii) Moreover, the distances to the origin of the farthest high peaks of these moments grow exactly exponentially with time.
  Our results provide an extension of the work of Chen and Dalang (Stoch PDE: Anal Comp (2015) 3:360-397) to a time-fractional setting. We also show that condition (i) holds when we study the same equation for $x\in\mathbb{R}^d.$</description>

      <title>Wong-Zakai approximations and support theorems for SDEs under Lyapunov conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Stroock-Varadhan type support theorems for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) under Lyapunov conditions, which significantly improve the existing results in the literature where the coefficients of the SDEs are required to be globally Lipschitz and of linear growth. Our conditions are very mild to include many important models, e.g. Threshold Ornstein-Ulenbeck process, Stochastic SIR model, Stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems, Stochastic Duffing-van der Pol oscillator model, which have polynomial the coefficients. To obtain the support theorem, we prove a new Wong-Zakai approximation problem, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Local weak convergence and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated in part by understanding average case analysis of fundamental algorithms in computer science, and in part by the wide array of network data available over the last decade, a variety of random graph models, with corresponding processes on these objects, have been proposed over the last few years. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview of local weak convergence, which has emerged as a major technique for understanding large network asymptotics for a wide array of functionals and models. As opposed to a survey, the main goal is to try to explain some of the major concepts and their use to junior researchers in the field and indicate potential resources for further reading.</description>

      <title>On Some Extensions of the Bou\'e-Dupuis Variational Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bou\'e-Dupuis variational formula gives a representation for log Laplace transforms of bounded measurable functions of a finite dimensional Brownian motion on a compact time interval as an infimum of a suitable cost over a collection of non-anticipative control processes. This variational formula has proved to be very useful in studying a variety of large deviation problems. In this article we collect some extensions of this basic result that have appeared in disparate venues in studying a broad range of large deviation questions. Some of these results can be found in a unified way in the recent book (Budhiraja and Dupuis(2019)), while others, to date, have been scattered at various places in the literature. The latter category includes, in particular, variational representations, when the stochastic dynamical system of interest has in addition to a driving L\'evy noise, another source of randomness, e.g. due to a random initial condition; when the functionals of interest depends on infinite-length paths of a L\'evy process; when the noise process is a Gaussian process with long-range dependence, e.g. a fractional Brownian motion, etc. The goal of this survey article is to present these diverse variational formulas in a systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Strong survival and extinction for branching random walks via a new order for generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider general discrete-time branching random walks on a countable set $X$. According to these processes, a particle at $x\in X$ generates a random number of children and places them at (some of) the sites of $X$, not necessarily independently nor with the same law at different starting vertices $x$.We introduce a new type of stochastic ordering of branching random walks, generalizing the germ order introduced by Hutchcroft in arXiv:2011.06402, which relies on the generating function of the process. We prove that given two branching random walks with law $\mathbf{\mu}$ and $\mathbf{\nu}$ respectively, with $\mathbf{\mu} \ge \mathbf{\nu}$, then in every set where there is extinction according to $\mathbf{\mu}$, there is extinction also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$. Moreover, in every set where there is strong local survival according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, there is strong local survival also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, provided that the supremum of the global extinction probabilities, for the $\mathbf{\nu}$-process, taken over all starting points $x$, is strictly smaller than 1. We also extend a result of Moyal which claims that, under some conditions, the global extinction probability for a branching random walk is the only fixed point of its generating function, whose supremum over all starting coordinates, may be equal to 1.</description>

      <title>Pinched-up periodic KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic KPZ fixed point is the conjectural universal limit of the KPZ universality class models on a ring when both the period and time critically tend to infinity. For the case of the periodic narrow wedge initial condition, we consider the conditional distribution when the periodic KPZ fixed point is unusually large at a particular position and time. We prove a conditional limit theorem up to the ``pinch-up" time. When the period is large enough, the result is the same as that for the KPZ fixed point on the line obtained by Liu and Wang in 2022. We identify the regimes in which the result changes and find probabilistic descriptions of the limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local perturbations in conservative particle systems can have a non-local influence on the stationary measure. To capture this phenomenon, we analyze in this paper two toy models. We study the symmetric exclusion process on a countable set of sites V with a source at a given point (called the origin), starting from a Bernoulli product measure with density $\rho$. We prove that when the underlying random walk on V is recurrent, then the system evolves towards full occupation, whereas in the transient case we obtain a limiting distribution which is not product and has long-range correlations. For independent random walkers on V , we analyze the same problem, starting from a Poissonian measure. Via intertwining with a system of ODE's, we prove that the distribution is Poissonian at all later times t &gt; 0, and that the system ''explodes'' in the limit t $\rightarrow$ $\infty$ if and only if the underlying random walk is recurrent. In the transient case, the limiting density is a simple function of the Green's function of the random walk.</description>

      <title>Tiny fluctuations of the averaging process around its degenerate steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze nonequilibrium fluctuations of the averaging process on $\mathbb T_\varepsilon^d$, a continuous degenerate Gibbs sampler running over the edges of the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. We show that, if we start from a smooth deterministic non-flat interface, recenter, blow-up by a non-standard CLT-scaling factor $\theta_\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{-(d/2+1)}$, and rescale diffusively, Gaussian fluctuations emerge in the limit $\varepsilon\to 0$. These fluctuations are purely dynamical, zero at times $t=0$ and $t=\infty$, and non-trivial for $t\in (0,\infty)$. We fully determine the correlation matrix of the limiting noise, non-diagonal as soon as $d\ge 2$. The main technical challenge in this stochastic homogenization procedure lies in a LLN for a weighted space-time average of squared discrete gradients. We accomplish this through a Poincar\'e inequality with respect to the underlying randomness of the edge updates, a tool from Malliavin calculus in Poisson space. This inequality, combined with sharp gradients' second moment estimates, yields quantitative variance bounds without prior knowledge of the limiting mean. Our method avoids higher (e.g., fourth) moment bounds, which seem inaccessible with the present techniques.</description>

      <title>Are giants in random digraphs `almost' local?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the first author showed that the giant in random undirected graphs is `almost' local. This means that, under a necessary and sufficient condition, the limiting proportion of vertices in the giant converges in probability to the survival probability of the local limit. We extend this result to the setting of random digraphs, where connectivity patterns are significantly more subtle. For this, we identify the precise version of local convergence for digraphs that is needed.
  We also determine bounds on the number of strongly connected components, and calculate its asymptotics explicitly for locally tree-like digraphs, as well as for other locally converging digraph sequences under the `almost-local' condition for the strong giant. The fact that the number of strongly connected components is {\em not} local once more exemplifies the delicate nature of strong connectivity in random digraphs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Multivariate Extremes in Multilayer Inhomogeneous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multilayer inhomogeneous random graph model (MIRG), whose layers may consist of both single-edge and multi-edge graphs. In the single layer case, it has been shown that the regular variation of the weight distribution underlying the inhomogeneous random graph implies the regular variation of the typical degree distribution. We extend this correspondence to the multilayer case by showing that the multivariate regular variation of the weight distribution implies the multivariate regular variation of the asymptotic degree distribution. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the extremal dependence structure present in the weight distribution will be adopted by the asymptotic degree distribution. By considering the asymptotic degree distribution, a wider class of Chung-Lu and Norros-Reittu graphs may be incorporated into the MIRG layers. Additionally, we prove consistency of the Hill estimator when applied to degrees of the MIRG that have a tail index greater than 1. Simulation results indicate that, in practice, hidden regular variation may be consistently detected from an observed MIRG.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions for Bernoulli and compound Poisson branching processes in random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For branching processes, the generating functions for limit distributions of so-called ratios of probabilities of rare events satisfy the Schr\"oder-type functional equations. Excepting limited special cases, the corresponding functional equations can not be solved analytically. I found a large class of Poisson-type offspring distributions, for which the Schr\"oder-type functional equations can be solved analytically. Moreover, for the asymptotics of limit distributions, the power and constant factor can be written explicitly. As a bonus, Bernoulli branching processes in random environments are treated. The beauty of this example is that the explicit formula for the generating function is unknown. Still, the closed-form expression for the power and constant factor in the asymptotic can be written with the help of some outstanding tricks.</description>

      <title>The ant on loops: Alexander-Orbach conjecture for the critical level set of the Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alexander and Orbach (AO) in 1982 conjectured that the simple random walk on critical percolation clusters (also known as the ant in the labyrinth) in Euclidean lattices exhibit mean field behavior; for instance, its spectral dimension is $4/3$. While false in low dimensions, this is expected to be true above the upper critical dimension of six. First rigorous results in this direction go back to Kesten who verified this on the tree. After many developments, in a breakthrough work, Kozma and Nachmias [KN] established the AO conjecture for bond percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d&gt;19$ and $d&gt;6$ for the spread out lattice. We investigate the validity of the AO conjecture for the critical level set of the Gaussian Free Field (GFF), a canonical dependent percolation model of central importance. In an influential work, Lupu proved that for the cable graph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (which is obtained by also including the edges), the signed clusters of the associated GFF are given by the corresponding clusters in a Poisson loop soup, thus reducing the analysis to the study of the latter.
  In 2021, Werner put forth an evocative picture for the critical behavior in this setting drawing an analogy with the usual bond case. Building on this, Cai and Ding established the universality of the extrinsic one arm exponent for all $d &gt; 6.$ In this article, we carry this program further, and consider the random walk on sub-sequential limits of the cluster of the origin conditioned to contain far away points. These form candidates for the Incipient Infinite Cluster (IIC), first introduced by Kesten in the planar case. Inspired by the program of [KN], introducing several novel ideas to tackle the long range nature of this model and its effect on the intrinsic geometry of the percolation cluster, we establish that the AO conjecture indeed holds for any sub-sequential IIC, for all large enough dimensions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of a Non-Linear Opinion Dynamics with Noisy Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several real \emph{Multi-Agent Systems} (MAS), it has been observed that only weaker forms of\emph{metastable consensus} are achieved, in which a large majority of agents agree on some  opinion  while other opinions continue to be supported  by  a (small) minority of agents. In this work, we take a step towards the investigation of metastable consensus for complex (non-linear) \emph{opinion dynamics} by considering the famous \undecided dynamics in the binary setting, which is known to reach consensus exponentially faster than the \voter dynamics.   We propose a simple form of uniform noise in which each message can change to another one with probability $p$ and we prove that the persistence of a \emph{metastable consensus} undergoes a \emph{phase transition} for $p=\frac 16$. In detail, below this threshold, we prove the system  reaches with high probability a metastable regime where  a large majority of agents keeps supporting the same opinion  for polynomial time. Moreover, this opinion turns out to be the initial majority opinion, whenever the initial bias is slightly larger than its standard deviation.On the contrary, above the threshold, we show that the information about the initial majority opinion is  "lost" within  logarithmic time even when the initial bias is maximum.Interestingly, using a simple coupling argument, we show the equivalence between our noisy model above and the model where a subset of agents behave in a \emph{stubborn} way.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Simpson's paradox via the common cause principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simpson's paradox is an obstacle to establishing a probabilistic association between two events $a_1$ and $a_2$, given the third (lurking) random variable $B$. We focus on scenarios when the random variables $A$ (which combines $a_1$, $a_2$, and their complements) and $B$ have a common cause $C$ that need not be observed. Alternatively, we can assume that $C$ screens out $A$ from $B$. For such cases, the correct association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ is to be defined via conditioning over $C$. This set-up generalizes the original Simpson's paradox. Now its two contradicting options simply refer to two particular and different causes $C$. We show that if $B$ and $C$ are binary and $A$ is quaternary (the minimal and the most widespread situation for valid Simpson's paradox), the conditioning over any binary common cause $C$ establishes the same direction of the association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ as the conditioning over $B$ in the original formulation of the paradox. Thus, for the minimal common cause, one should choose the option of Simpson's paradox that assumes conditioning over $B$ and not its marginalization. For tertiary (unobserved) common causes $C$ all three options of Simpson's paradox become possible (i.e. marginalized, conditional, and none of them), and one needs prior information on $C$ to choose the right option.</description>

      <title>On Non-Interactive Simulation of Distributed Sources with Finite Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Fourier analysis framework for the non-interactive source simulation (NISS) problem. Two distributed agents observe a pair of sequences $X^d$ and $Y^d$ drawn according to a joint distribution $P_{X^dY^d}$. The agents aim to generate outputs $U=f_d(X^d)$ and $V=g_d(Y^d)$ with a joint distribution sufficiently close in total variation to a target distribution $Q_{UV}$. Existing works have shown that the NISS problem with finite-alphabet outputs is decidable. For the binary-output NISS, an upper-bound to the input complexity was derived which is $O(\exp\operatorname{poly}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$. In this work, the input complexity and algorithm design are addressed in several classes of NISS scenarios. For binary-output NISS scenarios with doubly-symmetric binary inputs, it is shown that the input complexity is $\Theta(\log{\frac{1}{\epsilon}})$, thus providing a super-exponential improvement in input complexity. An explicit characterization of the simulating pair of functions is provided. For general finite-input scenarios, a constructive algorithm is introduced that explicitly finds the simulating functions $(f_d(X^d),g_d(Y^d))$. The approach relies on a novel Fourier analysis framework. Various numerical simulations of NISS scenarios with IID inputs are provided. Furthermore, to illustrate the general applicability of the Fourier framework, several examples with non-IID inputs, including entanglement-assisted NISS and NISS with Markovian inputs are provided.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQG Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of Hilbert space-valued Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) mean field games (MFGs), generalizing the classic LQG mean field game theory to scenarios where the state equations are driven by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, state and control processes take values in separable Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the state equations involve infinite dimensional noises, namely $Q$-Wiener processes. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population appearing in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of each agent involves the state, control, and the average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations, which forms the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. Next, we develop the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and obtain a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting Hilbert space-valued MFG. Finally, we establish the $\epsilon$-Nash property for the finite-player game in Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Unpredictable under Subjective Expected Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a decision maker who is unaware of objects to be sampled and thus cannot form beliefs about the occurrence of particular objects. Ex ante she can form beliefs about the occurrence of novelty and the frequencies of yet to be known objects. Conditional on any sampled objects, she can also form beliefs about the next object being novel or being one of the previously sampled objects. We characterize behaviorally such beliefs under subjective expected utility. In doing so, we relate "reverse" Bayesianism, a central property in the literature on decision making under growing awareness, with exchangeable random partitions, the central property in the literature on the discovery of species problem and mutations in statistics, combinatorial probability theory, and population genetics. Partition exchangeable beliefs do not necessarily satisfy "reverse" Bayesianism. Yet, the most prominent models of exchangeable random partitions, the model by De Morgan (1838), the one parameter model of Ewens (1972), and the two parameter model of Pitman (1995) and Zabell (1997), do satisfy "reverse" Bayesianism.</description>

Abstract: Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) measure is a convenient coherent risk measure. Due to certain difficulties in finding its analytical representation, it was previously calculated explicitly only for the normal distribution. We succeeded to overcome these difficulties and to calculate Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) measure for Poisson, compound Poisson, Gamma, Laplace, exponential, chi-squared, inverse Gaussian distribution and normal inverse Gaussian distribution with the help of Lambert function that is a special function, generally speaking, with two branches.</description>

      <title>Preserving correlations: A statistical method for generating synthetic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to generate statistically representative synthetic data. The main goal is to be able to maintain in the synthetic dataset the correlations of the features present in the original one, while offering a comfortable privacy level that can be eventually tailored on specific customer demands.
  We describe in detail our algorithm used both for the analysis of the original dataset and for the generation of the synthetic data points. The approach is tested using a large energy-related dataset. We obtain good results both qualitatively (e.g. via vizualizing correlation maps) and quantitatively (in terms of suitable $\ell^1$-type error norms used as evaluation metrics).
  The proposed methodology is general in the sense that it does not rely on the used test dataset. We expect it to be applicable in a much broader context than indicated here.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) from the classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have been studied recently, including the quantum-LOCAL model, finitely-dependent processes, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL model, and online-LOCAL model [e.g. STOC 2024, ICALP 2023].
  First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the $\Theta(\log^* n)$ complexity class by using non-signaling arguments.
  Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for trees: if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log^{(5)} n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.
  Put together, these results show that in trees the set of LCLs that can be solved with locality $O(\log^* n)$ is the same across all these models: locality $O(\log^* n)$ in quantum-LOCAL, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, or online-LOCAL is not stronger than locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.</description>

      <title>Capacity of the Hebbian-Hopfield network associative memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Hop82}, Hopfield introduced a \emph{Hebbian} learning rule based neural network model and suggested how it can efficiently operate as an associative memory. Studying random binary patterns, he also uncovered that, if a small fraction of errors is tolerated in the stored patterns retrieval, the capacity of the network (maximal number of memorized patterns, $m$) scales linearly with each pattern's size, $n$. Moreover, he famously predicted $\alpha_c=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m}{n}\approx 0.14$. We study this very same scenario with two famous pattern's basins of attraction: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} The AGS one from \cite{AmiGutSom85}; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} The NLT one from \cite{Newman88,Louk94,Louk94a,Louk97,Tal98}. Relying on the \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) from \cite{Stojnicflrdt23}, we obtain the following explicit capacity characterizations on the first level of lifting:
  \begin{equation}
  \alpha_c^{(AGS,1)} = \left ( \max_{\delta\in \left ( 0,\frac{1}{2}\right ) }\frac{1-2\delta}{\sqrt{2} \mbox{erfinv} \left ( 1-2\delta\right )} - \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\left ( \mbox{erfinv}\left ( 1-2\delta \right )\right )^2}\right )^2 \approx \mathbf{0.137906} \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  \alpha_c^{(NLT,1)} = \frac{\mbox{erf}(x)^2}{2x^2}-1+\mbox{erf}(x)^2 \approx \mathbf{0.129490}, \quad 1-\mbox{erf}(x)^2- \frac{2\mbox{erf}(x)e^{-x^2}}{\sqrt{\pi}x}+\frac{2e^{-2x^2}}{\pi}=0. \end{equation}
  A substantial numerical work gives on the second level of lifting $\alpha_c^{(AGS,2)} \approx \mathbf{0.138186}$ and $\alpha_c^{(NLT,2)} \approx \mathbf{0.12979}$, effectively uncovering a remarkably fast lifting convergence. Moreover, the obtained AGS characterizations exactly match the replica symmetry based ones of \cite{AmiGutSom85} and the corresponding symmetry breaking ones of \cite{SteKuh94}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of random surfaces, especially in the asymptotics of large genus, has been of increasing interest in recent years. Many geometrical questions have analogous formulations in the theory of random graphs with a large number of vertices, and results obtained in one area can inspire the other. In this paper, we are interested in the diameter of random surfaces, a basic measure of the connectivity of the surface. We introduce a new class of models of random surfaces built from random graphs and we compute the asymptotic of the diameter of these surfaces, which is logarithmic in the genus of the surface. The strategy of the proof relies on a detailed study of an exploration process which is the analogue of the breadth-first search exploration of a random graph. Its analysis is based on subadditive and concentration techniques.</description>

      <title>Co-evolving dynamic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general class of co-evolving tree network models driven by local exploration where new vertices attach to the current network via randomly sampling a vertex and then exploring the graph for a random number of steps in the direction of the root, connecting to the terminal vertex. Specific choices of the exploration step distribution lead to the well-studied affine preferential attachment and uniform attachment models, as well as less well understood dynamic network models with global attachment functionals such as PageRank scores [Chebolu-Melsted (2008)]. We obtain local weak limits for such networks and use them to derive asymptotics for the limiting empirical degree and PageRank distribution. We also quantify asymptotics for the degree and PageRank of fixed vertices, including the root, and the height of the network. Two distinct regimes are seen to emerge, based on the expected exploration distance of incoming vertices, which we call the `fringe' and `non-fringe' regimes. These regimes are shown to exhibit different qualitative and quantitative properties. In particular, networks in the non-fringe regime undergo `condensation' where the root degree grows at the same rate as the network size. Networks in the fringe regime do not exhibit condensation. Non-trivial phase transition phenomena are displayed for the height and the PageRank distribution, the latter connecting to the well known power-law hypothesis. In the process, we develop a general set of techniques involving local limits, infinite-dimensional urn models, related multitype branching processes and corresponding Perron-Frobenius theory, branching random walks, and in particular relating tail exponents of various functionals to the scaling exponents of quasi-stationary distributions of associated random walks. These techniques are expected to shed light on a variety of other co-evolving network models.</description>

Abstract: We establish both the $\limsup$ and the $\liminf$ law of the iterated logarithm (LIL), for the capacity of the range of a simple random walk in any dimension $d\ge 3$. While for $d \ge 4$, the order of growth in $n$ of such LIL at dimension $d$ matches that for the volume of the random walk range in dimension $d-2$, somewhat surprisingly this correspondence breaks down for the capacity of the range at $d=3$. We further establish such LIL for the Brownian capacity of a $3$-dimensional Brownian sample path and novel, sharp moderate deviations bounds for the capacity of the range of a $4$-dimensional simple random walk.</description>

Abstract: We consider the spectral radius of a large random matrix $X$ with independent, identically distributed entries. We show that its typical size is given by a precise three-term asymptotics with an optimal error term beyond the radius of the celebrated circular law. The coefficients in this asymptotics are universal but they differ from a similar asymptotics recently proved for the rightmost eigenvalue of $X$ in [29]. To access the more complicated spectral radius, we need to establish a new decorrelation mechanism for the low-lying singular values of $X-z$ for different complex shift parameters $z$ using the Dyson Brownian Motion.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for exit times on metric measure Dirichlet spaces and applications</title>

Abstract: Assuming the heat kernel on a doubling Dirichlet metric measure space has a generalized sub-Gaussian bound, we prove an asymptotically sharp spectral upper bound on the survival probability of the associated diffusion process. As a consequence, we can show that the supremum of the mean exit time over all starting points is finite if and only if the bottom of the spectrum is positive. Among several applications, we show that the spectral upper bound on the survival probability implies a bound for the Hot Spots constant for Riemannian manifolds. Our results apply to many interesting examples including Carnot groups, sub-Riemannian manifolds with transverse symmetries, and fractals.</description>

      <title>On approximation for time-fractional stochastic diffusion equations on the unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a two-stage stochastic model to investigate evolution of random fields on the unit sphere $\bS^2$ in $\R^3$. The model is defined by a time-fractional stochastic diffusion equation on $\bS^2$ governed by a diffusion operator with the time-fractional derivative defined in the Riemann-Liouville sense. In the first stage, the model is characterized by a homogeneous problem with an isotropic Gaussian random field on $\bS^2$ as an initial condition. In the second stage, the model becomes an inhomogeneous problem driven by a time-delayed Brownian motion on $\bS^2$. The solution to the model is given in the form of an expansion in terms of complex spherical harmonics. An approximation to the solution is given by truncating the expansion of the solution at degree $L\geq1$. The rate of convergence of the truncation errors as a function of $L$ and the mean square errors as a function of time are also derived. It is shown that the convergence rates depend not only on the decay of the angular power spectrum of the driving noise and the initial condition, but also on the order of the fractional derivative. We study sample properties of the stochastic solution and show that the solution is an isotropic H\"{o}lder continuous random field. Numerical examples and simulations inspired by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are given to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stationary measure for six-vertex model on a strip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic six-vertex model on a strip $$\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}^2: 0\leq y\leq x\leq y+N\right\}$$ with two open boundaries. We develop a `matrix product ansatz' method to solve for its stationary measure, based on the compatibility of three types of local moves of any down-right path. The stationary measure on a horizontal path turns out to be a tilting of the stationary measure of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with two open boundaries. Similar to open ASEP, the statistics of this tilted stationary measure as the number of sites $N\rightarrow\infty$ (with the bulk and boundary parameters fixed) also exhibit a phase diagram, which is a tilting of the phase diagram of open ASEP. We study the limit of mean particle density as an example.</description>

      <title>Optimal Wasserstein-$1$ distance between SDEs driven by Brownian motion and stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the following two $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stochastic differential equations (SDEs):
  \begin{gather*}
  d X_t=b(X_t)\,d t + \sigma\,d L_t, \quad X_0=x,
  %\label{BM-SDE}
  d Y_t=b(Y_t)\,d t + \sigma\,d B_t, \quad Y_0=y,
  \end{gather*}
  where $\sigma$ is an invertible $d\times d$ matrix, $L_t$ is a rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process, and $B_t$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Brownian motion (note that $B_t$ is a rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process with $\alpha=2$). We show that for any $\alpha_0 \in (1,2)$ the Wasserstein-$1$ distance $W_1$ satisfies for $\alpha \in [\alpha_0,2)$
  \begin{gather*}
  W_{1}\left(X_{t}^x, Y_{t}^y\right)
  \leq C_1 e^{-C_2t}|x-y|
  +\frac{C}{\alpha_0-1}(2-\alpha)d\log(1+d),
  \end{gather*}
  which implies, in particular,
  \begin{equation} \label{e:W1Rate}
  W_1(\mu_\alpha, \mu_2)
  \leq \frac{C}{\alpha_0-1}(2-\alpha)d\log(1+d),
  \end{equation}
  where $\mu_\alpha$ and $\mu_2$ are the ergodic measures of $X_t$ and $Y_t$ respectively.
  For the special case of a $d$-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck system, we show that $W_1(\mu_\alpha, \mu_2) \geq C_{d} (2-\alpha)$ for all $\alpha\in(1,2)$; this indicates that the convergence rate with respect to $\alpha$ in \eqref{e:W1Rate} is optimal. The term $d\log(1+d)$ appearing in the estimate \eqref{e:W1Rate} seems to be optimal for the dimension $d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a comparison theorem and a invariant representation theorem for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) without any assumption on the second variable $z$. Using the two results, we further develop the theory of $g$-expectations. Filtration-consistent nonlinear expectation (${\cal{F}}$-expectation) provides an ideal characterization for the dynamical risk measures, asset pricing and utilities. We propose two new conditions: an absolutely continuous condition and a (locally Lipschitz) domination condition. Under the two conditions respectively, we prove that any ${\cal{F}}$-expectation can be represented as a $g$-expectation. Our results contain a representation theorem for $n$-dimensional ${\cal{F}}$-expectations in the Lipschitz case, and two representation theorems for $1$-dimensional ${\cal{F}}$-expectations in the locally Lipschitz case, which contain quadratic ${\cal{F}}$-expectations.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Analysis Approach to Tensor Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two different arguments using stochastic analysis to construct super-renormalizable tensor field theories, namely the $\mathrm{T}^4_3$ and $\mathrm{T}^4_4$ models. The first approach is the construction of a Langevin dynamic combined with a PDE energy estimate while the second is an application of the variational approach of Barashkov and Gubinelli. By leveraging the melonic structure of divergences, regularising properties of non-local products, and controlling certain random operators, we demonstrate that for tensor field theories these arguments can be significantly simplified in comparison to what is required for $\Phi^4_d$ models.</description>

      <title>Operator formalism for discretely holomorphic parafermions of the two-color Ashkin-Teller, loop $\mathrm{O} ( 1 )$, staggered eight-vertex, odd eight-vertex, and abelian sandpile models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend an operator formalism, developed by Hongler, Kyt\"ol\"a, and Zahabi in 2012 for the Ising model, to the Ashkin-Teller and loop $\mathrm{O} ( n ) $ models. The formalism is primarily dependent upon notions of massive, and massless, s-holomorphicity of the Ising model, which are respectively satisfied at, and below, the critical temperature, hence allowing for rigorous analyses of the transfer matrix, correlation functions, and lattice fermion operators. From results of another paper, by Tanhayi-Ahari and Rouhani in 2012, which demonstrates that parafermionic observables for the staggered eight-vertex model coincide with those of the Ashkin-Teller model, as well as a 2003 paper, by Wu and Kunz, which establishes a correspondence between the staggered eight-vertex and odd eight-vertex models, we establish further associations.</description>

      <title>A phase transition and critical phenomenon for the two-dimensional random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the random field Ising model in a two-dimensional box with side length $N$ where the external field is given by independent normal variables with mean $0$ and variance $\epsilon^2$. Our primary result is the following phase transition at $T = T_c$: for $\epsilon \ll N^{-7/8}$ the boundary influence (i.e., the difference between the spin averages at the center of the box with the plus and the minus boundary conditions) decays as $N^{-1/8}$ and thus the disorder essentially has no effect on the boundary influence; for $\epsilon \gg N^{-7/8}$, the boundary influence decays as $N^{-\frac{1}{8}}e^{-\Theta(\epsilon^{8/7}\, N)}$ (i.e., the disorder contributes a factor of $e^{-\Theta(\epsilon^{8/7}\, N)}$ to the decay rate). For a natural notion of the correlation length, i.e., the minimal size of the box where the boundary influence shrinks by a factor of $2$ from that with no external field, we also prove the following: as $\epsilon\downarrow 0$ the correlation length transits from $\Theta(\epsilon^{-8/7})$ at $T_c$ to $e^{\Theta(\epsilon^{-4/3}\,\,)}$ for $T &lt; T_c$.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_1,\dots, X_n,\dots$ be i.i.d.\ $d$-dimensional random vectors with common distribution $F$. Then $S_n = X_1+\dots+X_n$ has distribution $F^n$ (degree is understood in the sense of convolution). Let $$ \rho_{\mathcal{C}_d}(F,G) = \sup_A |F\{A\} - G\{A\}|, $$ where the supremum is taken over all convex subsets of $\mathbb R^d$. Basic result is as follows. For any nontrivial distribution $F$ there is $c_1(F)$ such that $$ \rho_{\mathcal{C}_d}(F^n, F^{n+1})\leq \frac{c_1(F)}{\sqrt n} $$ for any natural $n$. The distribution $F$ is called trivial if it is concentrated on a hyperplane that does not contain the origin. Clearly, for such $F$ $$ \rho_{\mathcal{C}_d}(F^n, F^{n+1}) = 1. $$ A similar result for the Prokhorov distance is also obtained. For any $d$-dimensional distribution~$F$ there is a $c_2(F)&gt;0$ that depends only on $F$ and such that \begin{multline}\nonumber (F^n)\{A\}\le (F^{n+1})\{A^{c_2(F)}\}+\frac{c_2(F)}{\sqrt{n}} \text{and}\quad (F^{n+1})\{A\}\leq (F^n)\{A^{c_2(F)}\}+\frac{c_2(F)} {\sqrt{n}} \end{multline} for any Borel set $ A $ for all positive integers $n$. Here $A^{\varepsilon }$ is $ \varepsilon $-neighborhood of the set $ A $.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing $\langle c,x \rangle$ subject to the constraints $Ax \leq \mathbf{1}$, where $x\in{\mathbb R}^n$, $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix with mutually independent centered subgaussian entries of unit variance, and $c$ is a cost vector of unit Euclidean length. In the asymptotic regime $n\to\infty$, $\frac{m}{n}\to\infty$, and under some additional assumptions on $c$, we prove that the optimal objective value $z^*$ of the linear program satisfies $$ \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt{2\log(m/n)}\,z^*= 1\quad \mbox{almost surely}. $$ In the context of high-dimensional convex geometry, our findings imply sharp asymptotic bounds on the spherical mean width of the random convex polyhedron $P=\{x\in{\mathbb R}^n:\; Ax\leq \mathbf{1}\}$. We provide numerical experiments as supporting data for the theoretical predictions. Further, we carry out numerical studies of the limiting distribution and the standard deviation of $z^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO or UBQP) is concerned with maximizing/minimizing the quadratic form $H(J, \eta) = W \sum_{i,j} J_{i,j} \eta_{i} \eta_{j}$ with $J$ a matrix of coefficients, $\eta \in \{0, 1\}^N$ and $W$ a normalizing constant. In the statistical mechanics literature, QUBO is a lattice gas counterpart to the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glass model. Finding the optima of $H$ is an NP-hard problem. Several problems in combinatorial optimization and data analysis can be mapped to QUBO in a straightforward manner. In the combinatorial optimization literature, random instances of QUBO are often used to test the effectiveness of heuristic algorithms. Here we consider QUBO with random coefficients and show that if the $J_{i,j}$'s have zero mean, then, after proper normalization, the minimum and maximum \emph{per particle} of $H$ do not depend on the details of the distribution of the couplings and are concentrated around their expected values. Further, with the help of numerical simulations, we give estimates of the minimum and maximum of the objective function and provide some insight into the structure of the minimizer and the maximizer of $H$. We argue that also this structure is rather robust. Our findings hold in the diluted case where each of the $J_{i,j}$'s is allowed to be zero with probability going to $1$ as $N \to \infty$ in a suitable way.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Borel version of the local lemma, i.e. we show that, under suitable assumptions, if the set of variables in the local lemma has a structure of a Borel space, then there exists a satisfying assignment which is a Borel function. The main tool which we develop for the proof, which is of independent interest, is a parallel version of the Moser-Tardos algorithm which uses the same random bits to resample clauses that are far enough in the dependency graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.13937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of Langevin based algorithms, which overcomes many of the known shortcomings of popular adaptive optimizers that are currently used for the fine tuning of deep learning models. Its underpinning theory relies on recent advances of Euler's polygonal approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with monotone coefficients. As a result, it inherits the stability properties of tamed algorithms, while it addresses other known issues, e.g. vanishing gradients in neural networks. In particular, we provide a nonasymptotic analysis and full theoretical guarantees for the convergence properties of an algorithm of this novel class, which we named TH$\varepsilon$O POULA (or, simply, TheoPouLa). Finally, several experiments are presented with different types of deep learning models, which show the superior performance of TheoPouLa over many popular adaptive optimization algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of nonlinear damped wave equations indexed by a parameter $\epsilon &gt;0$ and forced by a space-time white noise on the two dimensional torus, with polynomial and sine nonlinearities. We show that as $\epsilon \to 0$, the solutions to these equations converge to the solution of the corresponding two dimensional stochastic quantization equation. In the sine nonlinearity case, the convergence is proven over arbitrary large times, while in the polynomial case, we prove that this approximation result holds over arbitrary large times when the parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero even with a lack of suitable global well-posedness theory for the corresponding wave equations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.</description>

      <title>Decay of the Green's function of the fractional Anderson model and connection to long-range SAW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a connection between the Green's function of the fractional Anderson model and the two point function of a self-avoiding random walk with long range jumps, adapting a strategy proposed by Schenker in 2015. This connection allows us to exploit results from the theory of self-avoiding random walks to improve previous bounds known for the fractional Anderson model at strong disorder. In particular, we enlarge the range of the disorder parameter where spectral localization occurs. Moreover we prove that the decay of Green's function at strong disorder for any $0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$ is arbitrarily close to the decay of the massive resolvent of the corresponding fractional Laplacian, in agreement with the case of the standard Anderson model $\alpha =1$. We also derive upper and lower bounds for the resolvent of the discrete fractional Laplacian with arbitrary mass $m\geq 0,$ that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm for SDEs driven by countably dimensional Wiener process and Poisson random measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of standard and multilevel Monte Carlo methods for weak approximation of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by the infinite-dimensional Wiener process and Poisson random measure with Lipschitz payoff function. The error of the truncated dimension randomized numerical scheme, which is determined by two parameters, i.e grid density $n \in \mathbb{N}_{+}$ and truncation dimension parameter $M \in \mathbb{N}_{+},$ is of the order $n^{-1/2}+\delta(M)$ such that $\delta(\cdot)$ is positive and decreasing to $0$. We derive complexity model and provide proof for the upper complexity bound of the multilevel Monte Carlo method which depends on two increasing sequences of parameters for both $n$ and $M.$ The complexity is measured in terms of upper bound for mean-squared error and compared with the complexity of the standard Monte Carlo algorithm. The results from numerical experiments as well as Python and CUDA C implementation are also reported.</description>

      <title>Orlicz regrets to consistently bound statistics of random variables with an application to environmental indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating environmental variables that vary stochastically is the principal topic for designing better environmental management and restoration schemes. Both the upper and lower estimates of these variables, such as water quality indices and flood and drought water levels, are important and should be consistently evaluated within a unified mathematical framework. We propose a novel pair of Orlicz regrets to consistently bound the statistics of random variables both from below and above. Here, consistency indicates that the upper and lower bounds are evaluated with common coefficients and parameter values being different from some of the risk measures proposed thus far. Orlicz regrets can flexibly evaluate the statistics of random variables based on their tail behavior. The explicit linkage between Orlicz regrets and divergence risk measures was exploited to better comprehend them. We obtain sufficient conditions to pose the Orlicz regrets as well as divergence risk measures, and further provide gradient descent-type numerical algorithms to compute them. Finally, we apply the proposed mathematical framework to the statistical evaluation of 31-year water quality data as key environmental indicators in a Japanese river environment.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Complete Asymptotic Expansions for the Normalizing Constants of High-Dimensional Matrix Bingham and Matrix Langevin Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For positive integers $d$ and $p$ such that $d \ge p$, we obtain complete asymptotic expansions, for large $d$, of the normalizing constants for the matrix Bingham and matrix Langevin distributions on Stiefel manifolds. The accuracy of each truncated expansion is strictly increasing in $d$; also, for sufficiently large $d$, the accuracy is strictly increasing in $m$, the number of terms in the truncated expansion. We apply these results to obtain the rate of convergence of these asymptotic expansions if both $d, p \to \infty$. Using values of $d$ and $p$ arising in various data sets, we illustrate the rate of convergence of the truncated approximations as $d$ or $m$ increases. These results extend our recent work on asymptotic expansions for the normalizing constants of the high-dimensional Bingham distributions.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and the Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and we prove the equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$.</description>

      <title>Pricing of geometric Asian options in the Volterra-Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric Asian options are a type of options where the payoff depends on the geometric mean of the underlying asset over a certain period of time. This paper is concerned with the pricing of such options for the class of Volterra-Heston models, covering the rough Heston model. We are able to derive semi-closed formulas for the prices of geometric Asian options with fixed and floating strikes for this class of stochastic volatility models. These formulas require the explicit calculation of the conditional joint Fourier transform of the logarithm of the stock price and the logarithm of the geometric mean of the stock price over time. Linking our problem to the theory of affine Volterra processes, we find a representation of this Fourier transform as a suitably constructed stochastic exponential, which depends on the solution of a Riccati-Volterra equation. Finally we provide a numerical study for our results in the rough Heston model.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated diffusion models, with the guidance-based classifier-free method taking the lead. However, the theory of the guidance-based method not only requires the user to fine-tune the "guidance strength," but its target vector field does not necessarily correspond to the conditional distribution used in training. In this paper, we develop the theory of conditional generation based on Flow Matching, a current strong contender of diffusion methods. Motivated by the interpretation of a probability path as a distribution on path space, we establish a novel theory of flow-based generation of conditional distribution by employing the mathematical framework of generalized continuity equation instead of the continuity equation in flow matching. This theory naturally derives a method that aims to match the matrix field as opposed to the vector field. Our framework ensures the continuity of the generated conditional distribution through the existence of flow between conditional distributions. We will present our theory through experiments and mathematical results.</description>
