      <title>Designing Automated Market Makers for Combinatorial Securities: A Geometric Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing automated market makers (AMMs) for prediction markets on combinatorial securities over large outcome spaces poses significant computational challenges. Prior research has primarily focused on combinatorial prediction markets within specific set systems (e.g., intervals, permutations). We introduce a framework for designing AMMs on arbitrary set systems by building a novel connection to the range query problem in computational geometry. This connection enables the analysis of computational complexity and the design of efficient AMMs.
  We first demonstrate the equivalence between price queries and trade updates under the popular combinatorial logarithmic market scoring rule market and the range query and range update problem. Building on this equivalence, we construct sublinear time algorithms when the VC dimension of the set system is bounded and show the non-existence of such algorithms for unbounded VC dimension cases. We then extend this approach to AMMs for combinatorial prediction markets with quadratic and power scoring rules. Finally, we show that the multi-resolution market design can be naturally integrated into the partition-tree scheme.
  Additionally, we introduce the combinatorial swap operation problem for automated market makers in decentralized finance and show that it can be efficiently reduced to range update problems.</description>

      <title>Counting of Shortest Paths in Cubic Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.04190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The enumeration of shortest paths in cubic grid is presented herein, which could have importance in image processing and also in the network sciences. The cubic grid considers three neighborhoods - namely, 6-, 18- and 26-neighborhood related to face connectivity, edge connectivity and vertex connectivity, respectively. The formulation for distance metrics is given. L1, D18, and L_$\infty$ are the three metrics for 6-neighborhood, 18-neighborhood and 26-neighborhood. The task is to count the number of minimal paths, based on given neighborhood relations, from any given point to any other, in the three-dimensional cubic grid. Based on the coordinate triplets describing the grid, the formulations for the three neighborhoods are presented in this work. The problem both of theoretical importance and has several practical aspects.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for Growing Collision-Free Convex Polytopes in Robot Configuration Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two novel algorithms for constructing convex collision-free polytopes in robot configuration space. Finding these polytopes enables the application of stronger motion-planning frameworks such as trajectory optimization with Graphs of Convex Sets [1] and is currently a major roadblock in the adoption of these approaches. In this paper, we build upon IRIS-NP (Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite &amp; Nonlinear Programming) [2] to significantly improve tunability, runtimes, and scaling to complex environments. IRIS-NP uses nonlinear programming paired with uniform random initialization to find configurations on the boundary of the free configuration space. Our key insight is that finding near-by configuration-space obstacles using sampling is inexpensive and greatly accelerates region generation. We propose two algorithms using such samples to either employ nonlinear programming more efficiently (IRIS-NP2 ) or circumvent it altogether using a massively-parallel zero-order optimization strategy (IRIS-ZO). We also propose a termination condition that controls the probability of exceeding a user-specified permissible fraction-in-collision, eliminating a significant source of tuning difficulty in IRIS-NP. We compare performance across eight robot environments, showing that IRIS-ZO achieves an order-of-magnitude speed advantage over IRIS-NP. IRISNP2, also significantly faster than IRIS-NP, builds larger polytopes using fewer hyperplanes, enabling faster downstream computation. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/fastiris</description>
