      <title>Quantifying Fish School Fragmentation under Predation Using Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study builds upon our previously proposed stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based model to further investigate fish school fragmentation under predation. Specifically, we explore structural dynamics by incorporating graph-theoretic metrics--namely, the number of connected components--to quantify changes in prey school organization. Two quantitative indicators, first split time and final component count, are introduced to assess the timing and extent of group disintegration. Sensitivity analyses are performed on key parameters to evaluate their influence on group stability under nearest attack and center attack strategies. We independently examine the effect of environmental noise on fish school cohesion. Simulation results show that parameter changes impact fish school fragmentation differently under the two predation strategies. High environmental noise also makes it difficult for the school to stay cohesive. This framework provides a structured and quantitative basis for assessing how fish schools respond to different predation strategies and environmental noise levels.</description>

      <title>Inferring processes within dynamic forest models using hybrid modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms. Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step. In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and succession trajectories compared to a fully mechanistic version of FINN. Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible, improved functional form of growth, which we extracted from the DNN using explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.</description>

      <title>Combining machine learning with data assimilation to improve the quality of phytoplankton forecasting in a shelf sea environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that combining machine learning with data assimilation leads to a major improvement in phytoplankton short-range (1-5 day) forecasts for the North-West European Shelf (NWES) seas. We show that excess nitrate concentrations are a major reason behind known biases in phytoplankton forecasts during late Spring and Summer, which can grow fast with lead time. Assimilating observations of nitrate would potentially help address this, but NWES nitrate data are typically not available in sufficient abundance to be effectively assimilated. We have therefore used a recently developed and validated neural network (NN) model predicting surface nitrate concentrations from a range of observable variables and implemented its assimilation within a research and development version of the Met Office's NWES operational forecasting system. As a result of nitrate assimilation the phytoplankton forecast skill improves by up to 30%. We show that although much of this improvement can be achieved by using a weekly nitrate climatology predicted by the NN model, there is a clear advantage in using flow-dependent nitrate data. We discuss the impacts of this improvement on a range of additional eutrophication indicators, such as dissolved inorganic phosphorus and sea bottom oxygen. We argue that it should be feasible to implement this hybrid machine learning - data assimilation approach within the near-real time NWES operational forecasting system.</description>

      <title>FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at \href{https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench}{https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench}.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Bioacoustics -- a Comparative Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated bioacoustic analysis is essential for biodiversity monitoring and conservation, requiring advanced deep learning models that can adapt to diverse bioacoustic tasks. This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS, BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model, is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages over evaluating these models without further training. While on BEANS, the baseline model BEATs trained with self-supervision on AudioSet outperforms bird-specific models when evaluated with attentive probing. These findings provide valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate models to adapt them to new bioacoustic classification tasks via probing.</description>

      <title>RinQ: Predicting central sites in proteins on current quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying functionally critical residues in proteins, utilizing techniques in quantum optimization. To that end, protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the centrality detection task is cast as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing, this approach is applied to a diverse set of proteins, including small peptides and biologically significant regulatory proteins. RinQ consistently finds residues that align with classical centrality benchmarks, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of the approach. This work highlights the promise of near-term quantum and quantum-inspired methods for advancing protein network analysis and lays the groundwork for future extensions to larger systems using real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimal Control for Coherent Spin Dynamics of Radical Pairs via Pontryagin Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at devising the shape of the external electromagnetic field which drives the spin dynamics of radical pairs to quantum coherent state through maximization of the triplet-singlet yield in biochemical reactions. The model is a Schr\"{o}dinger system with spin Hamiltonians given by the sum of Zeeman interaction and hyperfine coupling interaction terms. We introduce a one-parameter family of optimal control problems by coupling the Schr\"{o}dinger system to a control field through filtering equations for the electromagnetic field. Fr\'echet differentiability and the Pontryagin Maximum Principle in Hilbert space is proved, and the bang-bang structure of the optimal control is established. A new iterative Pontryagin Maximum Principle (IPMP) method for the identification of the bang-bang optimal control is developed. Numerical simulations based on IPMP and the gradient projection method (GPM) in Hilbert spaces are pursued, and the convergence, stability and the regularization effect are demonstrated. Comparative analysis of filtering with regular optimal electromagnetic field versus non-filtering with bang-bang optimal field ({\it Abdulla et al, Quantum Sci. Technol., {\bf9}, 4, 2024}) demonstrates the change of the maxima of the singlet yield is less than 1\%. The results open a venue for a potential experimental work for the magnetoreception as a manifestation of quantum biological phenomena.</description>

      <title>CITS: Nonparametric Statistical Causal Modeling for High-Resolution Neural Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how signals propagate through neural circuits is central to deciphering brain computation. While functional connectivity captures statistical associations, it does not reveal directionality or causal mechanisms. We introduce CITS (Causal Inference in Time Series), a non-parametric method for inferring statistically causal neural circuitry from high-resolution time series data. CITS models neural dynamics using a structural causal model with arbitrary Markov order and tests for time-lagged conditional independence using either Gaussian or distribution-free statistics. Unlike classical Granger Causality, which assumes linear autoregressive models and Gaussian noise, or the Peter-Clark algorithm, which assumes i.i.d. data and no temporal structure, CITS handles temporally dependent, potentially non-Gaussian data with flexible testing procedures. We prove consistency under mild mixing assumptions and validate CITS on simulated linear, nonlinear, and continuous-time recurrent neural network data, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We then apply CITS to Neuropixels recordings from mouse brain during visual tasks. CITS uncovers interpretable, stimulus-specific causal circuits linking cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal regions, consistent with experimental literature. It also reveals that neurons with similar orientation selectivity indices are more likely to be causally connected. Our results demonstrate the utility of CITS in uncovering biologically meaningful pathways and generating hypotheses for future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to model uncertainty in single-cell genomic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network models provide a powerful framework for analysing single-cell count data, facilitating the characterisation of cellular identities, disease mechanisms, and developmental trajectories. However, uncertainty modeling in unsupervised learning with genomic data remains insufficiently explored. Conventional clustering methods assign a singular identity to each cell, potentially obscuring transitional states during differentiation or mutation. This study introduces a variational Bayesian framework for clustering and analysing single-cell genomic data, employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to estimate the probabilistic association of cells with distinct clusters. This approach captures cellular transitions, yielding biologically coherent insights into neurogenesis and breast cancer progression. The inferred clustering probabilities enable further analyses, including Differential Expression Analysis and pseudotime analysis. Furthermore, we propose utilising the misclustering rate and Area Under the Curve in clustering scRNA-seq data as an innovative metric to quantitatively evaluate overall clustering performance. This methodological advancement enhances the resolution of single-cell data analysis, enabling a more nuanced characterisation of dynamic cellular identities in development and disease.</description>

      <title>CellForge: Agentic Design of Virtual Cell Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/CellForge.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based Perturb-seq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene perturbation models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Due to the cost of genomic experiments, active learning is often employed to train these models, alternating between wet-lab experiments and model updates. However, the operational constraints of the wet-lab and the iterative nature of active learning significantly increase the total training time. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity to model initialization can lead to markedly different sets of gene perturbations across runs, which undermines the reproducibility, interpretability, and reusability of the method. To this end, we propose a graph-based data filtering method that, unlike active learning, selects the gene perturbations in one shot and in a model-free manner. The method optimizes a criterion that maximizes the supervision signal from the graph neural network to enhance generalization. The criterion is defined over the input graph and is optimized with submodular maximization. We compare it empirically to active learning, and the results demonstrate that despite yielding months of acceleration, it also improves the stability of the selected perturbation experiments while achieving comparable test error.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Characterization of Similarity Judgments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.</description>

      <title>Functional limit theorems and parameter inference for multiscale stochastic models of enzyme kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with jumps modeling multistage Michaelis--Menten enzyme kinetics, in which a substrate is sequentially transformed into a product via a cascade of intermediate complexes. These networks are typically high dimensional and exhibit multiscale behavior with strong coupling between different components, posing substantial analytical and computational challenges. In particular, the problem of statistical inference of reaction rates is significantly difficult, and becomes even more intricate when direct observations of system states are unavailable and only a random sample of product formation times is observed. We address this in two stages. First, in a suitable scaling regime consistent with the Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA), we rigorously establish two asymptotic results: (i) a stochastic averaging principle yielding a reduced model for the product--substrate dynamics; and (ii) a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT) characterizing the associated fluctuations. Guided by the reduced-order dynamics, we next construct a novel Interacting Particle System (IPS) that approximates the product-substrate process at the particle level. This IPS plays a pivotal role in the inference methodology; in particular, we establish a propagation of chaos result that mathematically justifies an approximate product-form likelihood based solely on a random sample of product formation times, without requiring access to the system states. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>FARM: Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules</title>

Abstract: We introduce Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules (FARM), a novel foundation model designed to bridge the gap between SMILES, natural language, and molecular graphs. The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which directly incorporates functional group information into SMILES, enriching SMILES with detailed chemical context. For example, instead of using "O" to represent all oxygen atoms, we use specific tokens like "O_ketone" and "O_hydroxyl" to differentiate oxygen atoms belonging to distinct functional groups. This tokenization expands the chemical lexicon, effectively bridging the gap between SMILES and natural language in terms of vocabulary size, ultimately enhancing the model's ability to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by (1) using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and (2) employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. FARM leverages contrastive learning to aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 out of 13 tasks. These results highlight FARM's potential to improve molecular representation learning and demonstrate its strong transfer learning capabilities, paving the way for promising applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Image Capture for Computer Vision-Powered Taxonomic Identification and Trait Recognition of Biodiversity Specimens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17317</link>

Abstract: 1) Biological collections house millions of specimens with digital images increasingly available through open-access platforms. However, most imaging protocols were developed for human interpretation without considering automated analysis requirements. As computer vision applications revolutionize taxonomic identification and trait extraction, a critical gap exists between current digitization practices and computational analysis needs. This review provides the first comprehensive practical framework for optimizing biological specimen imaging for computer vision applications. 2) Through interdisciplinary collaboration between taxonomists, collection managers, ecologists, and computer scientists, we synthesized evidence-based recommendations addressing fundamental computer vision concepts and practical imaging considerations. We provide immediately actionable implementation guidance while identifying critical areas requiring community standards development. 3) Our framework encompasses ten interconnected considerations for optimizing image capture for computer vision-powered taxonomic identification and trait extraction. We translate these into practical implementation checklists, equipment selection guidelines, and a roadmap for community standards development including filename conventions, pixel density requirements, and cross-institutional protocols. 4)By bridging biological and computational disciplines, this approach unlocks automated analysis potential for millions of existing specimens and guides future digitization efforts toward unprecedented analytical capabilities.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Antibody Kinetics Post Infection and Vaccination: A Markov Chain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level, and inform booster timing recommendations.</description>
