      <title>The cost of uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional and most common view of economists on the issue of (bad) uncertainty and its effects has been one of partial equilibrium. When the topic is approached from a macroeconomic perspective, the most frequent has been the examination of the effects of uncertainty shocks on short-term dynamics with various methods, but mainly with neo-Keynesian and statistical (vector autoregressive) models. This document responds to another concern and has two objectives: 1. to reflect on this issue with some instruments of the macroeconomist's toolbox related to a medium or long-term horizon, and 2. report a ciphering of the social cost of uncertainty in the Colombian case.</description>

      <title>Cloud technologies, firm growth and industry concentration: Evidence from France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent empirical evidence finds positive associations between digitalisation and industry concentration. However, ICT may not be all alike. We investigate the effect of the purchase of cloud services on the long run size growth rate of French firms. Our findings suggest that cloud services positively impact firm growth rates, with smaller firms experiencing more significant benefits compared to larger firms. This evidence suggests that the diffusion of cloud technologies may help mitigate concentration in the era of the digital transition by favouring the digitalisation and growth of smaller firms, especially when the cloud services provided are more advanced.</description>

      <title>Composite Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a labor market model with concave mismatch costs, which arise when firms mitigate the cost of mismatch. Concave mismatch costs imply that output is neither supermodular nor submodular. We characterize sorting, wages, and comparative statics and show these substantively differ from traditional assignment models. Under composite sorting: (1) distinct worker types work in the same occupation, and (2) a worker type is simultaneously part of both positive and negative sorting. Quantitatively, our model can generate sizable earnings dispersion and the decomposition of earnings dispersion between and within occupations, as well as their changes over time.</description>

      <title>Golden parachutes under the threat of accidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a continuous-time contracting model that extends the problem introduced by Sannikov and later rigorously analysed by Possama\"{i} and Touzi. In our model, a principal hires a risk-averse agent to carry out a project. Specifically, the agent can perform two different tasks, namely to increase the instantaneous growth rate of the project's value, and to reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring. In order to compensate for these costly actions, the principal offers a continuous stream of payments throughout the entire duration of a contract, which concludes at a random time, potentially resulting in a lump-sum payment. We examine the consequences stemming from the introduction of accidents, modelled by a compound Poisson process that negatively impact the project's value. Furthermore, we investigate whether certain economic scenarii are still characterised by a golden parachute as in Sannikov's model. A golden parachute refers to a situation where the agent stops working and subsequently receives a compensation, which may be either a lump-sum payment leading to termination of the contract or a continuous stream of payments, thereby corresponding to a pension.</description>
