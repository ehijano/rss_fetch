      <title>Descent set distribution for permutations with cycles of only odd or only even lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the number of permutations in the symmetric group $S_{2n}$ with cycles of odd lengths only is equal to the number of permutations with cycles of even lengths only. We prove a refinement of this equality, involving descent sets: the number of permutations in $S_{2n}$ with a prescribed descent set and all cycles of odd lengths is equal to the number of permutations with the complementary descent set and all cycles of even lengths. There is also a variant for $S_{2n+1}$. The proof uses generating functions for character values and applies a new identity on higher Lie characters.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an densities for matroid basis hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a uniform matroid. For all positive integers $n$ and $r$ with $n \ge r$, what is the maximum number of bases of an $n$-element, rank-$r$ matroid without $U$ as a minor? We show that this question arises by restricting the problem of determining the Tur\'an number of a daisy hypergraph to the family of matroid basis hypergraphs. We then answer this question for several interesting choices of $U$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Constructions for DNA Self-Assembly of $k$-Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within biology, it is of interest to construct DNA complexes of a certain shape. These complexes can be represented through graph theory, using edges to model strands of DNA joined at junctions, represented by vertices. Because guided construction is inefficient, design strategies for DNA self-assembly are desirable. In the flexible tile model, branched DNA molecules are referred to as tiles, each consisting of flexible unpaired cohesive ends with the ability to form bond-edges. We thus consider the minimum number of tile and bond-edge types necessary to construct a graph $G$ (i.e. a target structure) without allowing the formation of graphs of lesser order, or nonisomorphic graphs of equal order. We emphasize the concept of (un)swappable graphs, establishing lower bounds for unswappable graphs. We also introduce a method of establishing upper bounds via vertex covers. We apply both of these methods to prove new bounds on rook's graphs and Kneser graphs.</description>

      <title>On the characterization of graphs with tree 3-spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tree spanner problem for a graph $G$ is as follows: For a given integer $k$, is there a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ (called a tree $k$-spanner) such that the distance in $T$ between every pair of vertices is at most $k$ times their distance in $G$? The minimum $k$ that $G$ admits a tree $k$-spanner is denoted by $\sigma(G)$. It is well known in the literature that determining $\sigma(G)\leq 2$ is polynomially solvable, while determining $\sigma(G)\leq k$ for $k\geq 4$ is NP-complete. A long-standing open problem is to characterize graphs with $\sigma(G)=3$. This paper settles this open problem by proving that it is polynomially solvable.</description>

      <title>On zero-sum Ramsey numbers modulo 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start with a systematic study of the zero-sum Ramsey numbers. For a graph $G$ with $0 \ (\!\!\!\!\mod 3)$ edges, the zero-sum Ramsey number is defined as the smallest positive integer $R(G, \mathbb{Z}_3)$ such that for every $n \geq R(G, \mathbb{Z}_3)$ and every edge-colouring $f$ of $K_n$ using $\mathbb{Z}_3$, there is a zero-sum copy of $G$ in $K_n$ coloured by $f$, that is: $\sum_{e \in E(G)} f(e) \equiv 0 \ (\!\!\!\!\mod 3)$.
  Only sporadic results are known for these Ramsey numbers, and we discover many new ones. In particular we prove that for every forest $F$ on $n$ vertices and with $0 \ (\!\!\!\!\mod 3)$ edges, $R(F, \mathbb{Z}_3) \leq n+2$, and this bound is tight if all the vertices of $F$ have degrees $1 \ (\!\!\!\!\mod 3)$. We also determine exact values of $R(T, \mathbb{Z}_3)$ for infinite families of trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Ollivier-Ricci curvature and its modification introduced by Lin, Lu, and Yau on locally finite graphs. The main contribution of this work is a lower bound on the minimum vertex degree of a graph ensuring non-negative Lin-Lu-Yau curvature. Additionally, we examine the sharpness of this lower bound.</description>

      <title>Efficient $k$-limited Dominating Broadcasts in Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph $ G $, a subset of vertices $ S $ is called an efficient dominating set (EDS) if every vertex in the graph is uniquely dominated by exactly one vertex in $ S $. A graph is said to be efficiently dominatable if it contains an EDS. Additionally, a function $ f: V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, \dots, k\} $ is termed a $ k $-limited dominating broadcast if, for every vertex $ u \in V(G) $, there exists a vertex $ v $, with $ f(v) \geq 1$ such that $ d(u, v) \leq f(v) $. A vertex $u$ is said to be dominated by a vertex $v$. In this work, we unify these two concepts to explore the notion of efficient $k$-limited broadcast domination in graphs. A $ k $-limited dominating broadcast $f$ is called an efficient $k$-limited dominating broadcast ($k$-$ELDB$) if each vertex in the graph is dominated exactly once. The minimum value of $k$ for which the given graph $G$ has $k$-$ELDB$ is defined as $mcr(G)$. We prove determining $mcr(G)$ is NP-Complete for general graphs and explore the $mcr(G)$ values and other related parameters on standard graphs and their products.</description>

      <title>$r$-Enriched Permutations and an Inequality of B\'ona-McLennan-White</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a duality
  between $r$-regular permutations and $r$-cycle permutations, and a monotone property due to B\'ona-McLennan-White on the probability $p_r(n)$ for a random permutation of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ to have an $r$-th root, where $r$ is a prime. For $r=2$, the duality relates permutations with odd cycles to permutations with even cycles. In general, given $r\geq 2$, we define an $r$-enriched permutation to be a permutation with $r$-singular cycles colored by one of the colors $1, 2, \ldots, r-1 $. In this setup, we discover a duality between $r$-regular permutations and enriched $r$-cycle permutations, which yields a stronger version of an inequality of B\'ona-McLennan-White. This answers their question of seeking a fully combinatorial understanding of the monotone property. When $r$ is a prime power $q^l$, we further show that $p_r(n)$ is monotone without using generating functions. In the case
  $n+1 \not\equiv 0 \pmod q$, the equality $p_r(n)=p_r(n+1)$
  has been established by Chernoff.</description>

      <title>The $E$-base of finite semidistributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicational bases (IBs) are a well-known representation of closure spaces and their closure lattices. This representation is not unique, though, and a closure space usually admits multiple IBs. Among these, the canonical base, the canonical direct base as well as the $D$-base aroused significant attention due to their structural and algorithmic properties. Recently, a new base has emerged from the study of free lattices: the $E$-base. It is a refinement of the $D$-base that, unlike the aforementioned IBs, does not always accurately represent its associated closure space. This leads to an intriguing question: for which classes of (closure) lattices do closure spaces have a valid $E$-base? Lower bounded lattices are known to form such a class. In this paper, we prove that for semidistributive lattices, the $E$-base is both valid and minimum.</description>

      <title>Fair Schedules for Single Round Robin Tournaments with Ranked Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new measure to capture fairness of a schedule in a single round robin (SRR) tournament when participants are ranked by strength. To prevent distortion of the outcome of an SRR tournament as well as to guarantee equal treatment, we argue that each participant should face its opponents when ranked by strength in an alternating fashion with respect to the home/away advantage. Here, the home/away advantage captures a variety of situations. We provide an explicit construction proving that so-called ranking-fair schedules exist when the number of participants is a multiple of 4. Further, we give a formulation that outputs ranking-fair schedules when they exist. Finally, we show that the most popular method to come to a schedule for an SRR tournament, does not allow ranking-fair schedules when the number of teams exceeds 8. These findings impact the type of schedules to be used for SRR tournaments.</description>

Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal{C}$ has polynomial expansion if there is a polynomial function $f$ such that for every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$, each of the depth-$r$ minors of $G$ has average degree at most $f(r)$. In this note, we study bounded-radius variants of some classical graph parameters such as bramble number, linkedness and well-linkedness, and we show that they are pairwise polynomially related. Furthermore, in a monotone graph class with polynomial expansion they are all uniformly bounded by a polynomial in $r$.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-Theoretic Characterizations of Classically Non-Ramseyian Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will develop a significantly more general notion of classical Ramsey numbers (extending most other graph-theoretic generalizations) and make some preliminary characterizations of these new Ramsey numbers using simple algebraic tools. Throughout, we make a case arguing that, while our access to specific values of Ramsey numbers (or, in general, precise numerical solutions to Ramsey-theoretic problems) may be limited, the interplay between and overall structure of Ramseyian objects is likely tractable. To support the relevancy of this perspective, we conclude by demonstrating that the Green-Tao Theorem, the Twin Prime conjecture, Zhang's bounded prime gap theorem, and Polignac's conjecture can be viewed as statements about Ramsey numbers.</description>

Abstract: Groupoid cardinality is an invariant of locally finite groupoids which has many of the properties of the cardinality of finite sets, but which takes values in all non-negative real numbers, and accounts for the morphisms of a groupoid. Several results on groupoid cardinality are proved, analogous to the relationship between cardinality of finite sets and i.e. injective or surjective functions. We also generalize to a broad class of (2,1)-categories a famous theorem of Lov\'asz which characterizes the isomorphism type of relational structures by counting the number of homomorphisms into them.</description>

      <title>On random locally flat-foldable origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of random flat-foldable origami. Given a crease pattern, we consider a uniformly random assignment of mountain and valley creases, conditioned on the assignment being flat-foldable at each vertex. A natural method to approximately sample from this distribution is via the face-flip Markov chain where one selects a face of the crease pattern uniformly at random and, if possible, flips all edges of that face from mountain to valley and vice-versa. We prove that this chain mixes rapidly for several natural families of origami tessellations -- the square twist, the square grid, and the Miura-ori -- as well as for the single-vertex crease pattern. We also compare local to global flat-foldability and show that on the square grid, a random locally flat-foldable configuration is exponentially unlikely to be globally flat-foldable.</description>

      <title>Combinatorially rich sets in partial semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several notions of size for semigroups that have natural analogues for partial semigroups. Among these are thick, syndetic, central, piecewise syndetic, IP, J, and the more recently introduced notion of combinatorially rich, abbreviated CR. We investigate the notion of CR set for adequate partial semigroups, its relation to other notions, especially J sets, and some surprising differences among them.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Tur\'an systems that are tight up to a multiplicative constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $n\ge s&gt; r$, the Tur\'an function $T(n,s,r)$ is the smallest size of an r-graph with n vertices such that every set of s vertices contains at least one edge. Also, define the Tur\'an density $t(s,r)$ as the limit of $T(n,s,r)/ {n\choose r}$ as $n\to\infty$. The question of estimating these parameters received a lot of attention after it was first raised by Tur\'an in 1941. A trivial lower bound is $t(s,r)\ge 1/{s\choose s-r}$. In the early 1990s, de Caen conjectured that $r\cdot t(r+1,r)\to\infty$ as $r\to\infty$ and offered 500 Canadian dollars for resolving this question.
  We disprove this conjecture by showing more strongly that for every integer $R\ge1$ there is $\mu_R$ (in fact, $\mu_R$ can be taken to grow as $(1+o(1))\, R\ln R$) such that $t(r+R,r)\le (\mu_R+o(1))/ {r+R\choose R}$ as $r\to\infty$, that is, the trivial lower bound is tight for every $R$ up to a multiplicative constant $\mu_R$.</description>

      <title>Upho lattices I: examples and non-examples of cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A poset is called upper homogeneous, or "upho," if every principal order filter of the poset is isomorphic to the whole poset. We study (finite type $\mathbb{N}$-graded) upho lattices, with an eye towards their classification. Any upho lattice has associated to it a finite graded lattice called its core, which determines its rank generating function. We investigate which finite graded lattices arise as cores of upho lattices, providing both positive and negative results. On the one hand, we show that many well-studied finite lattices do arise as cores, and we present combinatorial and algebraic constructions of the upho lattices into which they embed. On the other hand, we show there are obstructions which prevent many finite lattices from being cores.</description>

      <title>Characterizing real-representable matroids with large average hyperplane-size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing a theorem of the first two authors and Geelen for planes, we show that, for a real-representable matroid $M$, either the average hyperplane-size in $M$ is at most a constant depending only on its rank, or each hyperplane of $M$ contains one of a set of at most $r(M)-2$ lines. Additionally, in the latter case, the ground set of $M$ has a partition $(E_{1}, E_{2})$, where $E_{1}$ can be covered by few flats of relatively low rank and $|E_{2}|$ is bounded. These results extend to complex-representable and orientable matroids. Finally, we formulate a high-dimensional generalization of a classic problem of Motzkin, Gr\"unbaum, Erd\H{o}s and Purdy on sets of red and blue points in the plane with no monochromatic blue line. We show that the solution to this problem gives a tight upper bound on $|E_{2}|$. We also discuss this high-dimensional problem in its own right, and prove some initial results.</description>

      <title>The (Symbolic and Numeric) Computational Challenges of Counting 0-1 Balanced Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chessboard has the property that every row and every column has as many white squares as black squares. In this mostly methodological note, we address the problem of counting such rectangular arrays with a fixed (numeric) number of rows, but an arbitrary (symbolic) number of columns. We first address the ``vanilla" problem where there are no restrictions, and then go on to discuss the still-more-challenging problem of counting such binary arrays that are not permitted to contain a specified (finite) set of horizontal patterns, and a specified set of vertical patterns. While we can rigorously prove that each such sequence satisfies some linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients, actually finding these recurrences poses major {\it symbolic}-computational challenges, that we can only meet in some small cases. In fact, just generating as many as possible terms of these sequences is a big {\it numeric}-computational challenge. This was tackled by computer whiz Ron H. Hardin, who contributed several such sequences, and computed quite a few terms of each. We extend Hardin's sequences quite considerably. We also talk about the much easier problem of counting such restricted arrays without balance conditions.</description>

      <title>Average height for Abelian sandpiles and the looping constant on Sierpinski graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the Abelian sandpile model on Sierpinski graphs, we investigate several statistics such as average height, height probabilities and looping constant. In particular, we calculate the expected average height of a recurrent sandpile on the finite iterations of the Sierpinski gasket and we also give an algorithmic approach for calculating the height probabilities of recurrent sandpiles under stationarity by using the connection between recurrent configurations of the Abelian sandpile Markov chain and uniform spanning trees. We also calculate the expected fraction of vertices of height $i$ for $i\in\{0,1,2,3\}$ of sandpiles under stationarity and relate the bulk average height to the looping constant on the Sierpinski gasket.</description>

      <title>On combinatorics of plus-one generated line arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we focus on combinatorial aspects of plus-one generated line arrangements. We provide combinatorial constraints on such arrangements and we construct a polynomial that decodes the plus-one generated property. We present new examples of plus-one generated arrangements constructed by using classical Klein and Wiman reflection arrangements, and we detect, among all known sporadic simplicial arrangements up to $27$ lines, exactly $9$ arrangements that are minimal plus-one generated.</description>
