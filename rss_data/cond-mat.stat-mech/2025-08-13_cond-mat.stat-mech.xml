      <title>Ergodicity detection algorithms: Scaling of ergodicity in random symbolic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical definitions of distinct concepts that are needed in building an ergodicity detec- tion algorithm are introduced in a framework. This algorithmic framework is expressed in a discrete setting in an accessible manner for broader quantitative practitioners without loss of generality. At the same time, the common misconceptions of the requirement of visiting all available states in the time-averaged quantities for physical systems and non-existence of an ergodic process are resolved by introducing the distinction between Gibbs-Boltzmann and von Neumann-Birkhoff ergodic regimes. For this purpose, we introduce a new concept which is called sufficiency of sparse visit. We use finite symbolic random sequences as a pedagogical tool in establishing the different approaches for the detection of ergodic regimes of dynamical systems with vector patterns. The simple example system conveys the different attitudes in ergodicity regimes and offers guidance for building computational tools for its algorithmic detection.</description>

      <title>Emergence of distinct relaxation behaviour and Quantum Regression Theorem in the Ultra-strong Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we derive the dynamical equation governing two-time correlation functions in the ultra-strong coupling (USC) regime between the system and its environment. Unlike the case of the standard weak-coupling regime, in the USC case, we find distinct relaxation behavior for two-time correlators depending on the types of the operators involved in the correlation function. Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT) emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the system-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative spin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar gyration of a Brownian particle in a confining ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a minimal theoretical model that reveals a structured steady-state flux field with four alternating local circulation, a phenomenon we refer to as quadrupolar gyration. A passive Brownian particle is confined to move in a ring-shaped trap and driven far from equilibrium solely by anisotropic thermal fluctuations from two orthogonal heat baths held at different temperatures. By breaking detailed balance, this fundamental temperature anisotropy induces a robust nonequilibrium steady state characterized by probability currents of the particle's motion. Remarkably, these currents self-organize into a distinctive quadrupolar vortex pattern, providing a clear signature of emergent symmetry breaking, irreversible entropy production, and coherent motion in minimal passive systems.</description>

      <title>Correlators in phase-ordering from Schr\"odinger-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered phase with $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance and we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from the Schr\"odinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$ which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.</description>

      <title>Influence of attractive parts of interaction potentials on critical point parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how microscopic features of interparticle potentials influence macroscopic critical point parameters. Our analytical calculations are based on the cell model for continuous many-particle systems. We explore two types of pair interactions described by the Morse potential and a Curie-Weiss-type potential. For Morse fluids, we present numerical results obtained with microscopic parameters corresponding to the alkali metals sodium (Na) and potassium (K). The calculated dimensionless critical point parameters for liquid Na and K, expressed in dimensional units, allow for direct comparison with available experimental and simulation data. For the Curie-Weiss cell model with competing interactions, which exhibits a sequence of first-order phase transitions, we examine the critical parameters for the first three critical points. We analyze our results by varying the attractive part of the Morse potential and the Curie-Weiss attraction strength, providing insights into how these microscopic characteristics change critical point coordinates.</description>

      <title>Universal power-law distribution functions in an electromagnetic kinetic plasma: implications for the inverted temperature profile in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory for the relaxation of electromagnetic kinetic plasmas, and demonstrate that the mean distribution functions of both electrons and ions tend to relax to a universal $v^{-5}$ tail. Large-scale electromagnetic (EM) fields efficiently accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. This non-thermal tail may arise in the solar corona from EM turbulence despite collisions, allowing suprathermal particles to escape the sun's gravity (velocity filtration) and inverting the temperature $(T)$ profile with $T$ rising to $10^6$ K.</description>

      <title>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</description>

      <title>Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities.
  Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges.
  Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key.
  Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation.
  An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Quantum Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Constrained free energy minimization for the design of thermal states and stabilizer thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total $x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decades have seen growing interest in connecting principles of thermodynamics with methods from analytical mechanics. The thermodynamic formalism has become an inspiring framework in the study of smooth dynamical systems, and pioneering works of Helmholtz, Clausius, and Boltzmann have been reinstated as possible dynamical foundations of the (first part of the) Heat Theorem. The present paper follows the work of Wald et al., where black hole entropy was identified as a Noether charge. The adiabatic invariance of the thermodynamic entropy indeed invites a connection with Noether's theorem, and has been the subject of various papers. Here we add the case of GENERIC, a macroscopic dynamics whose acronym stands for ``General Equation for Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling''. Its evolution has two contributions: a dissipative part, which is of a generalized gradient descent form, and a Hamiltonian flow. We consider a quasistatic protocol for external parameters, and we embed GENERIC as the zero-cost flow for a Lagrangian governing the dynamical fluctuations. We find a continuous symmetry of the corresponding path-space action with the thermodynamic entropy as Noether charge, both in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. We make the calculations explicit through the example of an inertial probe with nonlinear friction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>

      <title>Stability of flocking in the reciprocal two-species Vicsek model: Effects of relative population, motility, and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural flocks need to cope with various forms of heterogeneities, for instance, their composition, motility, interaction, or environmental factors. Here, we study the effects of such heterogeneities on the flocking dynamics of the reciprocal two-species Vicsek model [Phys. Rev. E 107, 024607 (2023)], which comprises two groups of self-propelled agents with anti-aligning inter-species interactions and exhibits either parallel or anti-parallel flocking states. The parallel and anti-parallel flocking states vanish upon reducing the size of one group, and the system transitions to a single-species flock of the majority species. At sufficiently low noise (or high density), the minority species can exhibit collective behavior, anti-aligning with the liquid state of the majority species. Unequal self-propulsion speeds of the two species strongly encourage anti-parallel flocking over parallel flocking. However, when activity landscapes with region-dependent motilities are introduced, parallel flocking is retained if the faster region is given more space, highlighting the role of environmental constraints. Under noise heterogeneity, the colder species (subjected to lower noise) attain higher band velocity compared to the hotter one, temporarily disrupting any parallel flocking, which is subsequently restored. These findings collectively reveal how different forms of heterogeneity, both intrinsic and environmental, can qualitatively reshape flocking behavior in this class of reciprocal two-species models.</description>

Abstract: Brownian motion is a foundational problem in physics and is characterized by a mean squared displacement that scales linearly in time in thermal equilibrium, known as diffusion. At short times, the mean squared displacement becomes ballistic, scaling as t^2. This effect was predicted by Einstein in 1907 and recently observed experimentally. We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of t^(5/2). This new result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a non-zero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on non-zero initial velocities. These results are a first step towards the unraveling of nonequilibrium dynamics of fluids.</description>

      <title>Collective heat engines via different interactions: Minimal models, thermodynamics and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and thermodynamics of a framework composed of interacting units in which parameters (temperatures and energies) assume distinct values due to the contact with distinct (cold and hot) thermal reservoirs. The influence of different ingredients, such as the contact between thermal baths (simultaneous versus not simultaneous contact), the coupling between them (equal or different couplings) and the topology of interactions (all-to-all and local interactions) is investigated. Closed expressions for transition lines have been obtained, expressed by a linear combination of interaction energies times reciprocal temperatures for the simultaneous thermal contact baths and deviates from it when the contact is not simultaneous. The interplay between performance and dissipation is investigated under different conditions, giving rise to a richness of operation regimes, such as heat-engine and heat pump. The relationship between thermodynamic quantities (power, efficiency and dissipation) allows a careful choice of parameters to ensure the desirable compromise between them. Finally, the influence of different interactions energies (Ising, Potts versus Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) like) are investigated, revealing that Potts interactions in general present superior performances than BEG ones.</description>

      <title>Theory of Microphase Separation in Elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.</description>

      <title>Synaptic plasticity alters the nature of chaos transition in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In realistic neural circuits, both neurons and synapses are coupled in dynamics with separate time scales. The circuit functions are intimately related to these coupled dynamics. However, it remains challenging to understand the intrinsic properties of the coupled dynamics. Here, we develop the neuron-synapse coupled quasi-potential method to demonstrate how learning induces the qualitative change in macroscopic behaviors of recurrent neural networks. We find that under the Hebbian learning, a large Hebbian strength will alter the nature of the chaos transition, from a continuous type to a discontinuous type, where the onset of chaos requires a smaller synaptic gain compared to the non-plastic counterpart network. In addition, our theory predicts that under feedback and homeostatic learning, the location and type of chaos transition are retained, and only the chaotic fluctuation is adjusted. Our theoretical calculations are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Proper effective temperature and order parameters in relativistic non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the concept of temperature in non-equilibrium steady states. Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity within a (3+1)-dimensional heat bath. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature -- for the moving defect. Our results suggest that the proper effective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativistic non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold: gaplessness, order parameter, and scaling in $d$-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study several models of $d$-dimensional fermions ($d=1,2,3$) with an emphasis on the properties of their gapless (metallic) phase. It occurs at $T = 0$ as a continuous transition when zeros of the partition function reach the real range of parameters. Those zeros define the $(d-1)$-manifold of quantum criticality (Fermi surface). Its appearance or restructuring correspond to the Lifshitz transition. Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum space, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe quantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as $d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free fermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with scaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length, oscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the (hyper)scaling relations are satisfied. Two interacting cases of the Tomonaga-Luttinger ($d=1$) and the Fermi ($d=2,3$) liquids are analysed, yielding the same universality classes as free fermions.</description>

      <title>Step conductance and spin selectivity in a one dimensional tailored conical magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the conductance of a one dimensional free electron gas in double exchange interaction with a classical conical magnet. We find integer conductance steps depending on the energy window of the incoming electrons for conical magnets described by a fictitious magnetic field of different orientations and modulated profile. The conductance windows, that we attribute to potential or diffractive scattering, are characterised by spin selectivity depending on the fictitious magnetic field direction and chirality.</description>
