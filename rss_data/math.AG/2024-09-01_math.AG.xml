      <title>On the cohomologically trivial automorphisms of elliptic surfaces I: $\chi(S)=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this first part we describe the group $Aut_{\mathbb{Z}}(S)$ of cohomologically trivial automorphisms of a properly elliptic surface (a minimal surface $S$ with Kodaira dimension $\kappa(S)=1$), in the initial case $ \chi(\mathcal{O}_S) =0$.
  In particular, in the case where $Aut_{\mathbb{Z}}(S)$ is finite, we give the upper bound 4 for its cardinality, showing more precisely that if $Aut_{\mathbb{Z}}(S)$ is nontrivial, it is one of the following groups: $\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/3, (\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$. We also show with easy examples that the groups $\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/3$ do effectively occur.
  Respectively, in the case where $Aut_{\mathbb{Z}}(S)$ is infinite, we give the sharp upper bound 2 for the number of its connected components.</description>

      <title>Uniformization of varieties with log-canonical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of uniformizing quasi-projective varieties with logcanonical compactifications. More precisely, given a complex projective variety X with log-canonical singularities, we give criteria for X to be isomorphic to a Baily-Borel-Mok compactification of a ball quotient, asking on the one hand the equality case in a suitable Miyaoka-Yau (MY) inequality, and on the other hand some adequate assumptions on the singularities. We also give as a result of independent interest that log-resolutions of log-canonical singularities have their fibers connected by chains of special varieties in the sense of Campana; this is used in the proof to control the behaviour of the period map near the exceptional divisors of such resolutions. We also show that it is necessary to assume that the singularities are at least logcanonical: some examples of Deligne-Mostow-Deraux can be manipulated to provide examples of singular varieties satisfying the equality case in MY, while not being isomorphic to such Baily-Borel-Mok compactifications.</description>

      <title>On L-equivalence for K3 surfaces and hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between L-equivalence and D-equivalence for K3 surfaces and hyperk\"ahler manifolds. Building on Efimov's approach using Hodge theory, we prove that very general L-equivalent K3 surfaces are D-equivalent, leveraging the Derived Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces. Our main technical contribution is that two distinct lattice structures on an integral, irreducible Hodge structure are related by a rational endomorphism of the Hodge structure. We partially extend our results to hyperk\"ahler fourfolds and moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Integral cohomology of dual boundary complexes is motivic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we give a motivic characterization of the integral cohomology of dual boundary complexes of smooth quasi-projective complex algebraic varieties. As a corollary, the dual boundary complex of any stably affine space (of positive dimension) is contractible. In a separate paper [Su23], this corollary has been used by the author in his proof of the weak geometric P=W conjecture for very generic $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$-character varieties over any punctured Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Is there a group structure on the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a global field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let K be a global field, that is, a number field or a global function field. It is known that the answer to the question in the title over K is "Yes" when K has no real embeddings. We show that otherwise the answer is "No". Namely, we show that when K is a number field admitting a real embedding, it is impossible to define a group structure on the first Galois cohomology sets H^1(K,G) for all reductive K-groups G in a functorial way.</description>

      <title>Multigraded strong Lefschetz property for balanced simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the strong Lefschetz property for an $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebra, we introduce the multigraded strong Lefschetz property for an $\mathbb{N}^m$-graded algebra. We show that, for $\bm{a} \in \mathbb{N}^m_+$, the generic $\mathbb{N}^m$-graded Artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of an $\bm{a}$-balanced homology sphere over a field of characteristic $2$ satisfies the multigraded strong Lefschetz property. A corollary is the inequality $h_{\bm{b}} \leq h_{\bm{c}}$ for $\bm{b} \leq \bm{c} \leq \bm{a}-\bm{b}$ among the flag $h$-numbers of an $\bm{a}$-balanced simplicial sphere. This can be seen as a common generalization of the unimodality of the $h$-vector of a simplicial sphere by Adiprasito and the balanced generalized lower bound inequality by Juhnke-Kubitzke and Murai. We further generalize these results to $\bm{a}$-balanced homology manifolds and $\bm{a}$-balanced simplicial cycles over a field of characteristic $2$.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Lightning Self-Attention: Identifiability and Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider function spaces defined by self-attention networks without normalization, and theoretically analyze their geometry. Since these networks are polynomial, we rely on tools from algebraic geometry. In particular, we study the identifiability of deep attention by providing a description of the generic fibers of the parametrization for an arbitrary number of layers and, as a consequence, compute the dimension of the function space. Additionally, for a single-layer model, we characterize the singular and boundary points. Finally, we formulate a conjectural extension of our results to normalized self-attention networks, prove it for a single layer, and numerically verify it in the deep case.</description>

      <title>Shifted symplectic structures on derived analytic moduli of $\ell$-adic local systems and Galois representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a characterisation of non-Archimedean derived analytic geometry based on dg enhancements of dagger algebras. This allows us to formulate derived analytic moduli functors for many types of pro-\'etale sheaves, and to construct shifted symplectic structures on them by transgression using arithmetic duality theorems. In order to handle duality functors involving Tate twists, we introduce weighted shifted symplectic structures on formal weighted moduli stacks, with the usual moduli stacks given by taking $\mathbb{G}_m$-invariants.
  In particular, this establishes the existence of shifted symplectic and Lagrangian structures on derived moduli stacks of $\ell$-adic constructible complexes on smooth varieties via Poincar\'e duality, and on derived moduli stacks of $\ell$-adic Galois representations via Tate and Poitou--Tate duality; the latter proves a conjecture of Minhyong Kim.
  Unweighted shifted symplectic and Lagrangian structures are also established for $\ell$-adic Galois representations of cyclotomic fields $K(\mu_{\ell^{\infty}})$, subject to additional constraints related to Iwasawa theory; these derived moduli stacks yield a non-abelian analogue of Selmer complexes, with $0$-shifted symplectic structures related to generalised Cassels--Tate pairings.</description>

      <title>Cell decomposition and dual boundary complexes of character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak geometric P=W conjecture of L. Katzarkov, A. Noll, P. Pandit, and C. Simpson asserts that for any smooth Betti moduli space $\mathcal{M}_B$ of complex dimension $d$ over a punctured Riemann surface, the dual boundary complex $\mathbb{D}\partial\mathcal{M}_B$ is homotopy equivalent to a $(d-1)$-dimensional sphere. Here, we consider $\mathcal{M}_B$ as a generic $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$-character variety defined on a Riemann surface of genus $g$, with local monodromies specified by generic semisimple conjugacy classes at $k$ punctures.
  In this article, we establish the weak geometric P=W conjecture for all \emph{very generic} $\mathcal{M}_B$ in the sense that at least one conjugacy class is regular semisimple. A crucial step is to establish a stronger form of A. Mellit's cell decomposition theorem, i.e. we decompose $\mathcal{M}_B$ (without passing to a vector bundle) into locally closed subvarieties of the form $(\mathbb{C}^{\times})^{d-2b}\times\mathcal{A}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is stably isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^b$. A second ingredient involves a motivic characterization of the integral cohomology of dual boundary complexes developed in a subsequent article [Su24]. Following C. Simpson's strategy, the proof is now an inductive computation of the dual boundary complexes from such a cell decomposition.</description>

      <title>Flat comodules and contramodules as directed colimits, and cotorsion periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02734v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up to arXiv:2212.09639. We consider two algebraic settings of comodules over a coring and contramodules over a topological ring with a countable base of two-sided ideals. These correspond to two (noncommutative) algebraic geometry settings of certain kind of stacks and ind-affine ind-schemes. In the context of a coring $\mathcal C$ over a noncommutative ring $A$, we show that all $A$-flat $\mathcal C$-comodules are $\aleph_1$-directed colimits of $A$-countably presentable $A$-flat $\mathcal C$-comodules. In the context of a complete, separated topological ring $\mathfrak R$ with a countable base of neighborhoods of zero consisting of two-sided ideals, we prove that all flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules are $\aleph_1$-directed colimits of countably presentable flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. We also describe arbitrary complexes, short exact sequences, and pure acyclic complexes of $A$-flat $\mathcal C$-comodules and flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules as $\aleph_1$-directed colimits of similar complexes of countably presentable objects. The arguments are based on a very general category-theoretic technique going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer and rediscovered in arXiv:2310.16773. Applications to cotorsion periodicity and coderived categories of flat objects in the respective settings are discussed. In particular, in any acyclic complex of cotorsion $\mathfrak R$-contramodules, all the contramodules of cocycles are cotorsion.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples. A method of finding the unique characteristic corresponding to the vector of Riemann constants is suggested for non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves.</description>
