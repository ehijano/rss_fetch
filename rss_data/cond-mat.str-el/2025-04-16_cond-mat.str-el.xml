      <title>Ground-State-Based Model Reduction with Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant two-photon x-ray absorption in Cu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-space Green's function theory and calculations of two-photon x-ray absorption (TPA). Our focus is on non-resonant K-shell TPA in metallic Cu, which has been observed experimentally at intense x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) sources. The theory is based on an independentparticle Green's function treatment of the Kramers-Heisenberg equation and an approximation for the sum over non-resonant intermediate states in terms of a static quadrupole transition operator. XFEL effects are modeled by a partially depleted d-band. This approach is shown to give results for K-shell TPA in quantitative agreement with XFEL experiment and with a Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. We also briefly discuss many-body corrections and TPA sum-rules.</description>

      <title>Gapless Foliated-Exotic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct a new foliated quantum field theory equivalent to the exotic $\phi$-theory -- a fractonic gapless scalar field theory described by tensor gauge fields and exhibiting $U(1) \times U(1)$ subsystem global symmetry. This subsystem symmetry has an 't Hooft anomaly, which is captured by a subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phase in one dimension higher via the anomaly inflow mechanism. By analyzing both the anomaly inflow structure and the foliated-exotic duality in the SSPT phases, we establish the foliated-exotic duality in the $\phi$-theories. Furthermore, we also investigate the foliated-exotic duality in the $\hat\phi$-theory, which is dual to the $\phi$-theory, and construct the foliated $\hat\phi$-theory. These are the first examples of the foliated-exotic duality in gapless theories.</description>

      <title>Elastocaloric signature of the excitonic instability in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On cooling through a temperature $T_S$ of around 324 K, Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ undergoes a transition from a semimetallic state to one with a gapped electronic spectrum which is suspected to be an excitonic insulator. However, at this transition the structure also changes, from orthorhombic to monoclinic, leaving open the question of whether it is driven primarily by excitonic ordering or by a lattice instability. A lattice instability of this symmetry would correspond to softening of a B$_{2g}$ optical or acoustic phonon mode. Here, we report that elastocaloric measurements of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ with induced B$_{2g}$ strain reveal a thermodynamic susceptibility described by a Curie-Weiss law with a Curie temperature $T^*$ of 298 K. The fact that $T^*$ is close to $T_S$ rules out the possibility that the B$_{2g}$ acoustic mode is responsible for the transition. Since prior Raman measurements have shown minimal softening of the B$_{2g}$ optical mode as well, our finding strengthens the case that the transition is largely excitonic in nature. Our work underscores the potential of using strain as a tool for separating electronic and lattice contributions in phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Intertwined fluctuations and isotope effects in the Hubbard-Holstein model on the square lattice from functional renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions are responsible for the formation of spin, charge, and superconducting correlations in layered quantum materials. A paradigmatic model for such materials that captures both kinds of interactions is the two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model with a dispersionless Einstein phonon. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the magnetic, density, and superconducting fluctuations at and away from half-filling. To that end, we employ the functional renormalization group using the recently introduced extension of the single-boson exchange formulation. More precisely, we go beyond previous approaches to the model by resolving the full frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex and taking into account the feedback from the electronic self-energy. We perform broad parameter scans in the space of Hubbard repulsion, electron-phonon coupling strength, and phonon frequency to explore the leading magnetic, density, and superconducting susceptibilities from the adiabatic to the anti-adiabatic regime. Our numerical data reveal that self-energy effects lead to an enhancement of the $d$-wave superconducting susceptibility towards larger phonon frequencies, in contrast to earlier isotope-effect studies. At small phonon frequencies, large density contributions to the $s$-wave superconducting susceptibility change sign and eventually lead to a reduction of $s$-wave superconductivity with increasing electron-phonon coupling, signaling the breakdown of Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We analyze our findings systematically, employing detailed diagnostics of the intertwined fluctuations and pinning down the various positive and negative isotope effects of the physical susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Infinite temperature spin dynamics in the asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the infinite temperature dynamical spin structure factor of the asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, the relative of the asymmetric Hubbard model. It is characterized by distinct single particle energies for the two spin species, which interact with each other through a contact interaction in momentum space. We evaluate its spin structure factor exactly and follow the evolution of its excitation spectrum for all fillings and interactions, identify signatures of the Mott transition and fingerprints of the asymmetric hoppings. The longitudinal spin structure factor exhibits sound like and interaction induced gapped excitations, whose number gets doubled in the presence of hopping asymmetry. The transverse response displays the competition of interaction and asymmetry induced gaps and results in a quadratic excitation branch at their transition. The complete asymmetric case features momentum-independent dynamical structure factor, characteristic to transitions involving a flat band.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological order identified via Gutzwiller-guided density-matrix-renormalization-group: $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of topological phases in the SO($n$) spin chains using a combination of analytical parton construction and numerical techniques. For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is demonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.</description>

      <title>Spin demons in d-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demons are a type of plasmons, which consist of out-of-phase oscillations of electrons in different bands. Here, we show that $d$-wave altermagnets, a recently discovered class of collinear magnetism, naturally realize a spin demon, which consists of out-of-phase movement of the two spin species. The spin demon lives outside of the particle-hole continuum of one of the spin species, and is therefore significantly underdamped, reaching quality factors of $&gt;10$. We show that the spin demon carries a magnetic moment, which inherits the $d$-wave symmetry. Finally, we consider both three and two dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets, and show that spin demons exists in both.</description>

      <title>The interplay between Jahn-Teller distortions and structural degrees of freedom on pseudocubic states in manganite perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The average structure of the solid solution LaMn$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$O$_3$ (LMGO) has been investigated from a symmetry-motivated approach utilizing synchrotron x-ray and neutron powder diffraction techniques. We show experimentally that a trilinear coupling term ($\Gamma_5^+$M$_2^+$M$_3^+$) between shear strain, octahedral rotation, and the $C$-type orbital ordering mode is responsible for driving the orthorhombic to pseudocubic phase transition occurring in the composition range 0.5 $&lt;$ $x$ $&lt;$ 0.6. Our Monte Carlo simulations elucidate the macroscopic origin of this coupling to shear strain, and point to its importance with respect to controlling the orbital order-disorder transitions. We find that the emergence of the pseudocubic state can be rationalized by considering the competition between this trilinear term and a linear-quadratic term of the out-of-phase octahedral tilting with strain ($\Gamma_5^+$(R$_5^-$)$^2$). Illustrating the general nature of these results, we construct a simple function that captures the change in Landau free energy at the order-disorder transition, in parameters that are trivial to relate to the concentration of Jahn--Teller active species, temperature, tolerance factor and unit cell strain, for a broad range of manganite perovskites. Our results point to the fact that far from the pseudocubic state being a symptom of orbital disorder, it is in many cases more correctly to view it as a cause. The results have a broad impact on the study of orbital ordering physics in the perovskite materials and on chemical and physical control parameters through which to tune the richness of the intertwined physical properties.</description>

      <title>Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in Spin Supersolid Candidate Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersolid, an exotic quantum state of matter that consists of particles forming an incompressible solid structure while simultaneously showing superfluidity of zero viscosity [1], is one of the long-standing pursuits in fundamental research [2, 3]. Although the initial report of $^4$He supersolid turned out to be an artifact [4], this intriguing quantum matter has inspired enthusiastic investigations into ultracold quantum gases [5-8]. Nevertheless, the realization of supersolidity in condensed matter remains elusive. Here we find evidence for a quantum magnetic analogue of supersolid -- the spin supersolid -- in the recently synthesized triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ [9]. Notably, a giant magnetocaloric effect related to the spin supersolidity is observed in the demagnetization cooling process, manifesting itself as two prominent valley-like regimes, with the lowest temperature attaining below 100 mK. Not only is there an experimentally determined series of critical fields but the demagnetization cooling profile also shows excellent agreement with the theoretical simulations with an easy-axis Heisenberg model. Neutron diffractions also successfully locate the proposed spin supersolid phases by revealing the coexistence of three-sublattice spin solid order and interlayer incommensurability indicative of the spin superfluidity. Thus, our results indicate a strong entropic effect of the spin supersolid phase in a frustrated quantum magnet and open up a viable and promising avenue for applications in sub-Kelvin refrigeration, especially in the context of persistent concerns about helium shortages [10, 11].</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Geometry of Correlated Metals using Optical Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that the quantum geometry of electronic bands determines the electromagnetic properties of non-interacting insulators and semimetals. However, the role of quantum geometry in the optical responses of interacting electron systems remains largely unexplored. Here we examine the interplay between Coulomb interactions and Bloch-band quantum geometry in clean metals. We demonstrate that the low-frequency optical conductivity of a correlated metal encodes the structure of Bloch wave functions at the Fermi surface. This response originates from integrating out highly off-resonant interband scattering processes enabled by Coulomb interactions. The resulting quantum-geometric contribution appears generically in multiband systems, but becomes the dominant effect in the optical conductivity for a parabolic band. We consider a dilute correlated metal near a topological band inversion and show that the doping dependence of optical absorption can measure how the orbital character of Bloch wave functions changes at the Fermi surface. Our results illustrate how the confluence of quantum geometry and Coulomb interactions can enable optical processes and enrich the physics of Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>SymTFT construction of gapless exotic-foliated dual models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) for continuous subsystem symmetries, which are inherently non-Lorentz-invariant. Our framework produces dual bulk descriptions -- gapped foliated and exotic SymTFTs -- that generates gapless boundary theories with spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking via interval compactification. In analogy with the sandwich construction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. This is done by specifying gapped and symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. In this way we obtain the foliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ cube, and $\phi$, $\hat{\phi}$ theories. This also captures self-duality symmetries as condensation defects and provides a systematic method for generating free theories that non-linearly realize subsystem symmetries.</description>

      <title>Intermediate phases in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under in-plane magnetic field via interlayer spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted significant attention as a prime candidate for the spin-1/2 Kitaev spin liquid in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. Although its ground state is magnetically ordered, the order is suppressed under a moderate in-plane magnetic field. The intermediate regime of the field has exotic behaviours, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviours, the interlayer interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their perceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition, they may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer coupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their effects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on $T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the anisotropy in the intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\bar 3}$ structure, we show that the nearest neighbour interlayer interaction is XXZ-type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev-type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the interlayer interactions. Our findings provide new insights into the exotic behaviours and sample dependence reported in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</description>

      <title>Cat states carrying long-range correlations in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies Imply Intrinsic Long-Range Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for an Anderson transition in a disordered system with non-reciprocal hopping to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges are localized at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which the charges are localized at random positions. In periodic boundary conditions, the skin effect gives way to a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If additional multipole moments like dipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable for any amount of disorder. As a result, under periodic boundary conditions, the system is always delocalized regardless of disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Development of microwave surface elastoresistivity measurement technique under tunable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By integrating a dielectric microwave resonator with a piezoelectric-based strain device, we develop an in situ strain-tunable microwave spectroscopy technique that enables contactless measurements of superconducting properties under strain. In the slightly overdoped iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, we successfully observe a systematic strain dependence of the superconducting transition, manifested as changes in the quality factor and resonance frequency shifts. Both compressive and tensile anisotropic lattice distortions along the [110]${_{\rm T}}$ direction suppress superconductivity, consistent with standard transport measurements, highlighting the pivotal role of nematic fluctuations in the superconducting mechanism. Our strain-tunable cavity therefore serves as a powerful, contactless probe of fundamental superconducting material properties under strain and may also potentially facilitate the design of hybrid quantum systems with strain-controlled quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>XRD study of the magnetization plateau above 40 T in the frustrated helimagnet CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$, which contains a chromium breathing pyrochlore network, exhibits diverse magnetic phases, including an incommensurate helical state below 31 K and a 1/2-magnetization plateau above 40 T, owing to the interplay between magnetic frustration and spin-lattice coupling. Here, we perform a single-shot powder x-ray diffraction experiment on CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ in a pulsed high magnetic field of 55 T, revealing an orthorhombic-to-cubic (or pseudocubic) structural transition upon entering the 1/2-magnetization plateau phase at low temperatures. This observation suggests the emergence of a commensurate ferrimagnetic order, where a 3-up-1-down spin configuration is realized in each small tetrahedron, and the all-up or all-down in each large tetrahedron. We propose two types of 16-sublattice magnetic structures, which are degenerate within exchange interactions between the first, second, and third nearest neighbors.</description>

      <title>Unusual gas sensor response and semiconductor-to-insulator transition in WO3-x nanostructures : The role of oxygen vacancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WO3-x thinfilms featuring petal-like and lamella-like nanostructures are grown under controlled oxygen partial pressures using hot filament chemical vapor deposition. These synthesized WO3-x nanostructures exhibit monoclinic structure and contain a significant amount of oxygen vacancies (VO) as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. These WO3-x nanostructures demonstrate sensor response to both NH3 and NO2 gases even at room temperature. However, the sensor response varies with temperature and analyte gas type. For NH3, the sensors exhibit an increase in resistance behaving like a p-type semiconductor at temperatures below 150 0C while the resistance decreases at higher temperatures, resembling n-type semiconductor behavior. On the other hand, below 150 0C, these sensors display n-type behavior towards NO2 but act like p-type semiconductor at higher temperatures. Further temperature dependent transport studies were performed in these WO3-x nanostructures in the temperature range from 25 to 300 oC, after inducing additional VO in the films through annealing under CH4. The petal-like WO3-x nanostructures display an abrupt change in resistance, indicating insulator-to-semiconductor and semiconductor-to-insulator transitions during heating and cooling cycles respectively, in the temperature range of 100 - 212 0C. In lamella-like WO3-x nanostructures, the resistance is flipped from semiconductor-to-insulator at 300 0C and remains insulating state when cooled down to 30 0C. The abnormal gas sensing behavior and insulator - semiconductor transition is discussed in terms of VO in WO3-x nanostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of collective longitudinal modes, plasmons, in bulk hydrodynamic transport in Weyl semimetals is explored. In contrast to graphene, where these modes are gapless, plasmons in Weyl semimetals are gapped. This gap, however, can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing the temperature or the chemical potential, making plasmon modes thermally accessible, both in thermodynamics and transport. In very clean Weyl semimetals near charge-neutrality where the plasmon gap is minimal, we find that they leave an imprint in the thermal conductivity and the viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transverse acoustic (TA) phonon waves are analogous to electromagnetic waves and can carry a certain angular momentum. In this paper, we study the electron-TA phonon couplings in three-dimensional pentatellurides and explore the conditions under which the TA phonon condensation is stable. We analyze the Lindhard response function, phonon softening, mean-field parameters, and renormalized dispersions, on the basis of which the phase diagrams of the electron-phonon couplings in ZrTe$_5$ and HfTe$_5$ are calculated. The phase diagrams show that, if the chemical potential lies near the Weyl nodes, the TA phonon condensation will dominate and lead to the shear strain wave phase. We further reveal that when the wave vector of the particular phonon mode is smaller, the critical coupling strength will be weaker for the phonon condensation, which thus favors the condensation phase.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in open XXZ spin chains: Universal scaling and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic, or non-stabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in non-stabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Magnetic Structures at the 2D Limit of the Altermagnet MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MnTe has recently emerged as a canonical altermagnet, a newly identified class of magnetism characterized by compensated antiferromagnetic order coexisting with spin-split electronic bands, traditionally considered exclusive to ferromagnets. However, the extent to which altermagnetism persists as altermagnets are thinned to the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the magnetic behaviour of 2D MnTe, specifically atomically-thin monolayers (MLs) and bilayers (BLs) grown on graphene/Ir(111) substrate, by combining experimental scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism with density functional theory calculations. We find that while ML and BL MnTe adopt atomic structures with symmetries incompatible with altermagnetism, they exhibit intriguing magnetic phases: the BL forms a highly-robust layered antiferromagnet with in-plane spin anisotropy, whereas the ML exhibits a spin-glass-like behavior below its freezing temperature, a phenomenon not previously observed in an atomically thin material. These findings highlight how reduced dimensionality can promote the emergence of unusual magnetic structures distinct from those of their three-dimensional counterparts, providing new insights into low-dimensional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Efficient and systematic calculation of arbitrary observables for the matrix product state excitation ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on matrix product states (MPSs) are currently the de facto standard for calculating the ground-state properties of (quasi-)one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. While the properties of the low-lying excitations in such systems are often studied in this MPS framework through _dynamics_ by means of time-evolution simulations, we can also look at their _statics_ by directly calculating eigenstates corresponding to these excitations. The so-called MPS excitation ansatz is a powerful method for finding such eigenstates with a single-particle character in the thermodynamic limit. Although this excitation ansatz has been used quite extensively, a general method for calculating expectation values for these states is lacking in the literature: we aim to fill this gap by presenting a recursive algorithm to calculate arbitrary observables expressed as matrix product operators. This method concisely encapsulates existing methods for -- as well as extensions to -- the excitation ansatz, such as excitations with a larger spatial support and multi-particle excitations, and is robust enough to handle further innovations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by studying the low-lying excitations in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain and the one-dimensional Hubbard model, looking at how the excitations converge in the former, while in the latter, we present a refined method of targeting single-particle excitations inside a continuum by minimizing the energy _variance_ rather than the energy itself. We hope that this technique will foster further advancements with the excitation ansatz.</description>

Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a disordered Kitaev chain with long-range pairing when connected to two metallic leads exchanging particles with external Lindblad baths. We (i) monitor the subgap modes at increasing disorder, (ii) compute the current flowing across the system at a finite voltage bias between the baths, and (iii) study the normal single particle lead correlations across the chain. Throughout our derivation, we evidence the interplay between disorder and topology. In particular, we evidence the reentrant behavior of the massive, topological
  phase at limited values of the disorder strength, similar to what happens in the short-range pairing
  Kitaev model. Our results suggest the possibility of a disorder-induced direct transition between the massive and
  the short-range topological phase of the long-range pairing Kitaev model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At temperatures much lower than its superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 2.1 K, the heavy fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ has a remarkable phase diagram of magnetic field $H$ vs. angles $\phi$ and $\theta$ at which $H$ is tilted away from the $b$-axis toward the $a$- and $c$-axes, respectively, in the orthorhombic unit cell. The phase diagram appears to contain three superconducting phases: (1) a low field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extending over all values of $\phi$ and $\theta$ with an upper critical field $H_{c2}$ with a maximum value of 15 T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$; (2) a high field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ located in a region between $\phi \approx 7^\circ$ and $\theta \approx 4^\circ$ in fields from $H_{c2\mathrm{LF}}$ of the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase and the metamagnetic transition at $H_m$ at $\sim 35$ T marking the onset of the magnetic field polarized FP phase: and (3) a SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ superconducting phase that resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from $\theta \approx 20^\circ$ to $40^\circ$ in fields from $\sim 40$ T to above 60 T. In this work, we studied the $H$ vs $\theta$ phase diagram at a base temperature of $\sim 0.6$ K as a function of Th concentration $x$ in U$_{1-x}$Th$_x$Te$_2$ pseudobinary compounds for $0.5\% \lesssim x \lesssim 4.7\%$. We find that for all values of $x$ within this range, the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase is retained with a reduced value of $H_{c2}$ of $\sim 10$ T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$ for $x = 4.7\%$, while the SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ phase is suppressed. The SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ and FP phases are unaffected to values of $x = 2\%$ but are completely suppressed in the region $x = 2.5$ to $4.7\%$ where the residual resistance ratio RRR has decreased from $\sim 14$ at $x = 1.5\%$ to values of $\sim 3$, indicating a significant increase in disorder.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field effect on excitonic condensation emergent in extended Falicov-Kimball model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These findings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and magnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known that the spin-wave dispersion, which is usually symmetric in the momentum space with respect to ${\bf q}=0$, can be asymmetric in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and an applied magnetic field. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that in $J_3$-dominant classical Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the breathing kagome lattice, the asymmetric spin-wave dispersion appears in a chiral phase due to non-uniform geometric phases acquired in the spin-wave propagation processes. This points to the emergence of a nonreciprocal spin wave in the absence of both the DM interaction and the magnetic field. Reflecting the asymmetry, positive-spin-chirality and negative-spin-chirality states, either one of which is selected in the low-temperature phase by the symmetry breaking, show different spin-wave dispersions, suggesting that the two energetically-degenerate chiral states can be distinguished by the spin-wave propagation.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new class of collinear compensated magnetic phase, has garnered tremendous interest because of its rich physics and promising applications. Physical models and verified material candidates for altermagnetism remain limited. Here, we propose a general scheme to construct altermagnetic models, which explicitly exhibits the blend of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations in real space via the design of spin clusters, echoing the observation that properties of altermagnets resemble a mixture of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We show that in some of our models, the desired altermagnetic order can be spontaneously realized by electron-electron interaction in a broad range of the phase diagram. This development facilitates the study of fascinating physics of altermagnetism and sheds light on the discovery of new altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>A relativistic non-perturbative local model of fractons and its non-local perturbative hidden sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, from first principles, a covariant local model for scalar fractonic matter coupled to a symmetric tensor gauge field. The free gauge field action is just the one of the Blasi-Maggiore model. The scalar sector, describing fracton charges, is a non-trivial covariant generalization of Pretko's quartic model. Because the model has no quadratic term in the scalar field, a direct perturbative treatment fails. Remarkably, by performing a suitable change of variables, we demonstrate that the action can be driven to a perturbative effective action. However, at the price of carrying non-local interacting terms. We study the perturbative regime of the model first by analyzing the classical field equations and some possible simple solutions, which are in accordance with the expected immobile behavior of fractons. We also derive the fracton dispersion relation and, by playing with the parameters of the model, show that there are at least six distinct phases: one with two massive fractonic modes, one of them being tachyonic; one with massless states associated with a long-range attractive potential; a mixed phase with one massive and one massless state; another one where physical states of the scalar field cannot occur at all in the physical spectrum; a massive phase with states of two different masses; and second phase where the scalar field cannot be associated with physical particles, in spite of its mass being real. Moreover, we find evidence that fractonic bound states emerge in the model for some of these phases.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics. Experimental efforts to date have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials typically amorphous metals and semiconducting quantum Hall or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems. However, the interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials where the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling $\nu=-1$ as well as a superconducting state at $\nu-3.5$ at zero magnetic field. Remarkably, gate voltage can also be used to actuate nonvolatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further reveal a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at $\nu=2/3$-also stable at zero magnetic field-enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket, while leaving the topology of the $\nu=-1$ quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low-disorder limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in monitored quantum dynamics are non-equilibrium phase transitions between quantum-chaotic (volume-law entangled) and entanglement-suppressed, area-law phases. We reveal how monitored dynamics are situated within the framework of general far-from-equilibrium, quantum condensed-matter physics. Measurement-induced heating effects scramble the distribution function in generic (interacting) monitored fermion systems, which enables a simplified symmetry-based description of the dynamics. We demonstrate the equivalence of the Keldysh technique with the conventional Statistical-Mechanics Model for circuits, resulting from a doubled Hilbert-space (Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski) mapping. We illustrate this using the monitored dynamics of interacting fermions with a conserved charge, deriving a unified effective field theory that captures all phases and phase transitions. The non-interacting counterpart in 1D space only has an area-law phase, with no MIPT. This was explained via an effective non-linear sigma model replica field theory possessing a very large symmetry. We show that other phases and phase transitions emerge when the replica symmetry is reduced by interactions. The reduced symmetry combines a replica permutation symmetry and charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT, which can be recognized via a separatrix in the renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the ``charge-sharpening" transition between two kinds of dynamics, where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the measurements. The field theory explains why the charge-sharpening transition should occur only in the volume-law phase. Our framework provides a template for other classes of MIPTs and situates these within the arena of non-equilibrium condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>Chemical enhancement of superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 with mode-selective coupling between kagome phonons and flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In kagome metals, flat electronic bands induced by frustrated hopping are a platform for strong electron correlations. In particular, a selective coupling of flat band states to certain kagome phonon modes is proposed as a universal origin of superconductivity in this material class. Here, we investigate the superconductivity in the kagome system LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. Ge-dopants induce a uniaxial lattice expansion along the $c$-axis. Our first-principles calculations suggest that this mitigates the detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers and reduces the dispersion of the Ru-$4d_{x^2-y^2}$ flat band. The calculated chemical potential moves closer to the maximum in the energy-dependent density of states. Our result is consistent with a theoretical prediction of tunable flat band superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ by mode-selective coupling between specific kagome phonons and the Ru-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.</description>
