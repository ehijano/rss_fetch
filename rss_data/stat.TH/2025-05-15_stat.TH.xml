      <title>Information Spreading in Random Graphs Evoving by Norros-Reittu Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the spreading of a message within the random graph evolving by the Norros-Reittu preferential attachment model. The latter model forms random Poissonian numbers of edges between newly added nodes and existing ones. For a pre-fixed time $T^*$, the probability mass functions of the number of nodes obtained the message and the total number of nodes in the graph, as well as the distribution function of their ratio are derived. To this end, the success probability to disseminate the message from the node with the message to the node without message is proved. The exposition is illustrated by the simulation study.</description>

      <title>On Unbiased Low-Rank Approximation with Minimum Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm for sampling a low-rank random matrix $Q$ that best approximates a fixed target matrix $P\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times m}$ in the following sense: $Q$ is unbiased, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[Q] = P$; $\mathsf{rank}(Q)\leq r$; and $Q$ minimizes the expected Frobenius norm error $\mathbb{E}\|P-Q\|_F^2$. Our algorithm mirrors the solution to the efficient unbiased sparsification problem for vectors, except applied to the singular components of the matrix $P$. Optimality is proven by showing that our algorithm matches the error from an existing lower bound.</description>

      <title>Robust and Computationally Efficient Trimmed L-Moments Estimation for Parametric Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust and computationally efficient estimation framework for fitting parametric distributions based on trimmed L-moments. Trimmed L-moments extend classical L-moment theory by downweighting or excluding extreme order statistics, resulting in estimators that are less sensitive to outliers and heavy tails. We construct estimators for both location-scale and shape parameters using asymmetric trimming schemes tailored to different moments, and establish their asymptotic properties for inferential justification using the general structural theory of L-statistics, deriving simplified single-integration expressions to ensure numerical stability. State-of-the-art algorithms are developed to resolve the sign ambiguity in estimating the scale parameter for location-scale models and the tail index for the Frechet model. The proposed estimators offer improved efficiency over traditional robust alternatives for selected asymmetric trimming configurations, while retaining closed-form expressions for a wide range of common distributions, facilitating fast and stable computation. Simulation studies demonstrate strong finite-sample performance. An application to financial claim severity modeling highlights the practical relevance and flexibility of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note establishes that the opposite Gaussian product inequality (GPI) of the type proved by Russell &amp; Sun (2022a) in two dimensions, and partially extended to higher dimensions by Zhou et al. (2024), continues to hold for an arbitrary mix of positive and negative exponents. A general quantitative lower bound is also obtained conditionally on the GPI conjecture being true.</description>

      <title>Spike-timing-dependent Hebbian learning as noisy gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hebbian learning is a key principle underlying learning in biological neural networks. It postulates that synaptic changes occur locally, depending on the activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian learning based on neuronal firing rates is well explored, much less is known about learning rules that account for precise spike-timing. We relate a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect to a natural loss function on the probability simplex. This connection allows us to prove that the learning rule eventually identifies the presynaptic neuron with the highest activity. We also discover an intrinsic connection to noisy mirror descent.</description>

      <title>Batched Nonparametric Bandits via k-Nearest Neighbor UCB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sequential decision-making in batched nonparametric contextual bandits, where actions are selected over a finite horizon divided into a small number of batches. Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement. Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of the jump-size distribution for an M/G/1 storage system with Poisson sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a non-parametric estimator for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the jump-size distribution for a storage system with compound Poisson input. The workload process is observed according to an independent Poisson sampling process. The nonparametric estimator is constructed by first estimating the characteristic function (CF) and then applying an inversion formula. The convergence rate of the CF estimator at $s$ is shown to be of the order of $s^2/n$, where $n$ is the sample size. This convergence rate is leveraged to explore the bias-variance tradeoff of the inversion estimator. It is demonstrated that within a certain class of continuous distributions, the risk, in terms of MSE, is uniformly bounded by $C n^{-\frac{\eta}{1+\eta}}$, where $C$ is a positive constant and the parameter $\eta&gt;0$ depends on the smoothness of the underlying class of distributions. A heuristic method is further developed to address the case of an unknown rate of the compound Poisson input process.</description>

      <title>Risk Bounds for Quantile Additive Trend Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates risk bounds for quantile additive trend filtering, a method gaining increasing significance in the realms of additive trend filtering and quantile regression. We investigate the constrained version of quantile trend filtering within additive models, considering both fixed and growing input dimensions. In the fixed dimension case, we discover an error rate that mirrors the non-quantile minimax rate for additive trend filtering, featuring the main term $n^{-2r/(2r+1)}V^{2/(2r+1)}$, when the underlying quantile function is additive, with components whose $(r-1)$th derivatives are of bounded variation by $V$. In scenarios with a growing input dimension $d$, quantile additive trend filtering introduces a polynomial factor of $d^{(2r+2)/(2r+1)}$. This aligns with the non-quantile variant, featuring a linear factor $d$, particularly pronounced for larger $r$ values. Additionally, we propose a practical algorithm for implementing quantile trend filtering within additive models, using dimension-wise backfitting. We conduct experiments with evenly spaced data points or data that samples from a uniform distribution in the interval $[0,1]$, applying distinct component functions and introducing noise from normal and heavy-tailed distributions. Our findings confirm the estimator's convergence as $n$ increases and its superiority, particularly in heavy-tailed distribution scenarios. These results deepen our understanding of additive trend filtering models in quantile settings, offering valuable insights for practical applications and future research.</description>

      <title>Time-Uniform Confidence Spheres for Means of Random Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08168v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential mean estimation in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we derive time-uniform confidence spheres -- confidence sphere sequences (CSSs) -- which contain the mean of random vectors with high probability simultaneously across all sample sizes. Our results include a dimension-free CSS for log-concave random vectors, a dimension-free CSS for sub-Gaussian random vectors, and CSSs for sub-$\psi$ random vectors (which includes sub-gamma, sub-Poisson, and sub-exponential distributions). Many of our results are optimal. For sub-Gaussian distributions we also provide a CSS which tracks a time-varying mean, generalizing Robbins' mixture approach to the multivariate setting. Finally, we provide several CSSs for heavy-tailed random vectors (two moments only). Our bounds hold under a martingale assumption on the mean and do not require that the observations be iid. Our work is based on PAC-Bayesian theory and inspired by an approach of Catoni and Giulini.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for the Symbolic Correlation Integral and the Renyi-2 Entropy under Short-range Dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symbolic correlation integral provides a way to measure the complexity of time series and dynamical systems. In the present article we prove limit results for an estimator of this quantity which is based on U-statistics under the assumption of short-range dependence. To this end, we slightly generalize classical limit results in the framework of 1-approximating functionals. Furthermore, we carefully analyze the limit variance. A simulation study with ARMA and ARCH time series as well as a real world data example are also provided. In the latter we show how our method could be used to analyze EEG data in the context of epileptic seizures.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of VAR(1) model in a stationary setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a classical First-order Vector AutoRegressive (VAR(1)) model, where we interpret the autoregressive interaction matrix as influence relationships among the components of the VAR(1) process that can be encoded by a weighted directed graph. A majority of previous work studies the structural identifiability of the graph based on time series observations and therefore relies on dynamical information. In this work we assume that an equilibrium exists, and study instead the identifiability of the graph from the stationary distribution, meaning that we seek a way to reconstruct the influence graph underlying the dynamic network using only static information. We use an approach from algebraic statistics that characterizes models using the Jacobian matroids associated with the parametrization of the models, and we introduce sufficient graphical conditions under which different graphs yield distinct steady-state distributions. Additionally, we illustrate how our results could be applied to characterize networks inspired by ecological research.</description>

      <title>On the statistical analysis of grouped data: when Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived -- somewhat naively -- as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands.
  Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data, which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics -- that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases -- with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests.
  Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by members of the class of weighted linear statistics.</description>

      <title>A Stable Measure for Conditional Periodicity of Time Series using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, such as cross-correlation, coherence, cross-recurrence, and dynamic time warping. But we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results.
  Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity of one univariate time series f1 given another f2, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. With the use of dimension reduction in mind, we prove a new stability result for score(f1|f2) under principal component analysis (PCA) when we use the projections of the time series embeddings onto their respective first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. Finally we derive a lower bound on the minimum embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings give scores that are within a given epsilon of each other.
  We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several pairs of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of cross-recurrence, and show the increased accuracy and stability of our score when predicting and measuring whether or not the periodicities of two time series are similar.</description>

      <title>Targeted Data Fusion for Causal Survival Analysis Under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference across multiple data sources offers a promising avenue to enhance the generalizability and replicability of scientific findings. However, data integration methods for time-to-event outcomes, common in biomedical research, are underdeveloped. Existing approaches focus on binary or continuous outcomes but fail to address the unique challenges of survival analysis, such as censoring and the integration of discrete and continuous time. To bridge this gap, we propose two novel methods for estimating target site-specific causal effects in multi-source settings. First, we develop a semiparametric efficient estimator for settings where individual-level data can be shared across sites. Second, we introduce a federated learning framework designed for privacy-constrained environments, which dynamically reweights source-specific contributions to account for discrepancies with the target population. Both methods leverage flexible, nonparametric machine learning models to improve robustness and efficiency. We illustrate the utility of our approaches through simulation studies and an application to multi-site randomized trials of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies for HIV-1 prevention, conducted among cisgender men and transgender persons in the United States, Brazil, Peru, and Switzerland, as well as among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings underscore the potential of these methods to enable efficient, privacy-preserving causal inference for time-to-event outcomes under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>An Improved Satterthwaite Effective Degrees of Freedom Correction for Weighted Syntheses of Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22080v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an improved approximation for the effective degrees of freedom in the Satterthwaite (1941, 1946) method which estimates the distribution of a weighted combination of variance components The standard Satterthwaite approximation assumes a scaled chisquare distribution for the composite variance estimator but is known to be biased downward when component degrees of freedom are small. Building on recent work by von Davier (2025), we propose an adjusted estimator that corrects this bias by modifying both the numerator and denominator of the traditional formula. The new approximation incorporates a weighted average of component degrees of freedom and a scaling factor that ensures consistency as the number of components or their degrees of freedom increases. We demonstrate the utility of this adjustment in practical settings, including Rubin's (1987) total variance estimation in multiple imputations, where weighted variance combinations are common. The proposed estimator generalizes and further improves von Davier's (2025) unweighted case and more accurately approximates synthetic variance estimators with arbitrary weights.</description>
