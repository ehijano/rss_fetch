      <title>Controlling X-ray emission with optical nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear processes lie at the heart of many technologies such as frequency converters and entangled photon sources. Historically, observation and manipulation of these processes, for instance through nanostructures, has been limited to optical and lower frequencies. Recently, however, second-order nonlinear processes which couple X-ray and optical photons have been observed and used to probe the electronic structure and optical response of materials. Observing and controlling these processes remains challenging due to their low efficiency and the difficulty of fabricating devices with spatial features on the scale of X-ray wavelengths. Here, we show how optical nanostructures can be used to manipulate X-ray/optical nonlinear processes, using a quantum theory which describes these second-order nonlinear interactions. As an example, we show how photonic crystals shape both the spectral and spatial characteristics of X-rays emitted through X-ray to optical parametric down-conversion, leading to a fill-factor-normalized rate enhancement of 2.2 over an unstructured medium, in addition to control over the directionality of X-ray emission. The ability to control X-ray nonlinear processes may lead to more monochromatic, heralded X-ray sources, enhanced ghost imaging of lattice and electronic dynamics, and imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. Our framework illuminates a path towards controlling quantum optical effects at X-ray frequencies.</description>

      <title>NeOTF: Speckle-Constrained OTF Neural Representation for Non-invasive Imaging through Scattering Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging through scattering media via speckle correlation is fundamentally challenged by ill-posed reconstruction. To overcome this, we bypass direct object recovery and instead target the system's deterministic optical transfer function (OTF). We introduce NeOTF, a framework that learns an implicit neural representation of the OTF. By optimizing this representation using multi-frame speckle intensities and a physical Fourier-domain prior, NeOTF robustly retrieves the system's OTF. Subsequent deconvolution with this retrieved OTF yields high-fidelity object reconstructions. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that NeOTF achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time scattering imaging.</description>

      <title>End-to-end image compression and reconstruction with ultrahigh speed and ultralow energy enabled by opto-electronic computing processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of AR/VR, remote sensing, satellite radar, and medical equipment has created an imperative demand for ultra efficient image compression and reconstruction that exceed the capabilities of electronic processors. For the first time, we demonstrate an end to end image compression and reconstruction approach using an optoelectronic computing processor,achieving orders of magnitude higher speed and lower energy consumption than electronic counterparts. At its core is a 32X32 silicon photonic computing chip, which monolithically integrates 32 high speed modulators, 32 detectors, and a programmable photonic matrix core, copackaged with all necessary control electronics (TIA, ADC, DAC, FPGA etc.). Leveraging the photonic matrix core programmability, the processor generates trainable compressive matrices, enabling adjustable image compression ratios (from 2X to 256X) to meet diverse application needs. Deploying a custom lightweight photonic integrated circuit oriented network (LiPICO-Net) enables high quality reconstruction of compressed images. Our approach delivers an end to end latency of only 49.5ps/pixel while consuming only less than 10.6nJ/pixel-both metrics representing 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement compared with classical models running on state-of-the-art GPUs. We validate the system on a 130 million-pixel aerial imagery, enabling real time compression where electronic systems falter due to power and latency constraints. This work not only provides a transformative solution for massive image processing but also opens new avenues for photonic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous networks for phase-sensitive engineering of optical disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous networks provide a universal framework for extracting subsystem-level features of a complex system, which are critical in graph colouring, pattern classification, and motif identification. When abstracting physical systems into networks, distinct groups of nodes and links in heterogeneous networks can be decomposed into different modes of multipartite networks, allowing for a deeper understanding of both intra- and inter-group relationships. Here, we develop heterogeneous network modelling of wave scattering to engineer multiphase random heterogeneous materials. We devise multipartite network decomposition determined by material phases, which is examined using uni- and bi-partite network examples for two-phase multiparticle systems. We show that the directionality of the bipartite network governs the phase-sensitive alteration of microstructures. The proposed modelling enables a network-based design to achieve phase-sensitive microstructural features, while almost preserving the overall scattering response. With examples of designing quasi-isoscattering stealthy hyperuniform materials, our results provide a general recipe for engineering multiphase materials for wave functionalities.</description>

      <title>Eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic near-eye displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact, lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Material Effects On Direct ToF Signal Response In Optical Tactile Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tactile sensing holds transformative potential for robotics, particularly in collaborative environments where touch perception enhances safety, adaptability, and cognitive interaction. However, traditional tactile technologies based on total internal reflection (TIR) and frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) - such as those used in touchscreen systems - face significant limitations. These include reliance on multiple infrared light sources and cameras, as well as poor adaptability to the complex, curved geometries often found in robotic systems. To address these challenges, we recently introduced OptoSkin, an advanced optical tactile sensor based on direct Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology, enabling touch and pressure detection. In this study, we investigate how specific material properties, particularly light scattering, influence the sensitivity of contact point detection under direct ToF sensing. Four materials with distinct scattering coefficients were selected to assess their impact on signal quality across different contact scenarios involving various target surfaces.</description>

      <title>Fast Simulation of Wide-Angle Coherent Diffractive Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) using intense XUV and soft X-ray pulses holds the promise to deliver information on the three dimensional shape as well as the optical properties of nano-scale objects in a single diffraction image. This advantage over conventional X-ray diffraction methods comes at the cost of a much more complex description of the underlying scattering process due to the importance of wide-angle scattering and propagation effects.The commonly employed reconstruction of the sample properties via iterative forward fitting of diffraction patterns requires an accurate and fast method to simulate the scattering process. This work introduces the propagation multi-slice Fourier transform method (pMSFT) and demonstrates its superior performance and accuracy against existing methods for wide-angle scattering. A derivation from first principles, a unified physical picture of the approximations underlying pMSFT and the existing methods, as well as a systematic benchmark that provides qualified guidance for the selection of the appropriate scattering method is presented.</description>

      <title>The Transmission Line Model for 2D Materials and van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures (VdWHs) composed of 2D materials have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their intriguing optical properties, such as strong light-matter interactions and large intrinsic anisotropy. In particular, VdWHs support a variety of polaritons-hybrid quasiparticles arising from the coupling between electromagnetic waves and material excitations-enabling the confinement of electromagnetic radiation to atomic scales. The ability to predict and simulate the optical response of 2D materials heterostructures is thus of high importance, being commonly performed until now via methods such as the TMM, or Fresnel equations. While straight forward, these often yield long and complicated expressions, limiting intuitive and simple access to the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the optical response. In this work, we demonstrate the adaptation of the transmission line model for VdWHs, based on expressing its constituents by distributed electrical circuit elements described by their admittance. Since the admittance carries fundamental physical meaning of the material response to electromagnetic fields, the approach results in a system of propagating voltage and current waves, offering a compact and physically intuitive formulation that simplifies algebraic calculations, clarifies the conditions for existence of physical solutions, and provides valuable insight into the fundamental physical response. To demonstrate this, we derive the transmission line analogs of bulk to monolayer 2D materials and show it can be used to compute the reflection/transmission coefficients, polaritonic dispersion relations, and electromagnetic field distributions in a variety of VdWHs, and compare them to experimental measurements yielding very good agreement. This method provides a valuable tool for exploring and understanding the optical response of layered 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Large-Area Metal-Integrated Grating Electrode Achieving Near 100% Infrared Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly transparent and conductive electrodes operating in the infrared (IR) are critically needed for a broad range of technologies, including light-emitting diodes, lasers and photodetectors, which are key building blocks of infrared cameras, LiDARs, and thermal systems such as IR heaters. While transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) have seen substantial progress in the visible spectrum, their performance in the IR remains limited due to increased absorption and reflection caused by the plasma resonance of free carriers in conductive materials. Here, we demonstrate a large-area TCE based on a metal-integrated monolithic high-contrast grating (metalMHCG) fabricated on a GaAs substrate. This structure acts as an effective antireflection coating, achieving near-unity transmission of unpolarized mid- to far-infrared (M-FIR) light. The metalMHCG exhibits 94% transmission at a wavelength of 7 micrometers, corresponding to 135% relative to transmission through a flat GaAs-air interface, while maintaining an exceptionally low sheet resistance of 2.8 ohms per square. By simultaneously delivering excellent optical transparency and electrical conductivity, the metalMHCG establishes a new performance benchmark among M-FIR TCEs and provides a versatile platform for next-generation high-power optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optically Actuated Transitions in Multimodal, Bistable Micromechanical Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a new class of optomechanical nonlinearities in weakly damped micromechanical resonators, arising from the interplay between the Duffing nonlinearity, intermodal coupling, and thermal fluctuations. Within the bistable regime of a single Duffing mode driven by radiation pressure forces, we observe stochastically generated sidebands, originating from thermal fluctuations around equilibrium trajectories in phase space, and exploit these sidebands to induce probabilistic transitions between bistable states using weak secondary acoustic excitation. Extending this framework to multimodal interactions, we show that nonlinear modes coupling within the same resonator leads to similar transitions due to parametric modulation around the noise-excited sidebands as a result of frequency mixing. Simultaneously, abrupt changes in displacements of modes cause their instantaneous energy exchange rates to span five orders of magnitude. These findings open new avenues for reconfigurable optomechanical networks, nonreciprocal energy transport, and precision sensing based on dynamically tunable mechanical nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation in polycrystalline ZnS nanowaveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the realization of Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) nanowaveguides and the experimental observation of second harmonic generation (SHG) in such structures, demonstrating their potential for integrated nonlinear photonics. ZnS thin films were deposited via RF magnetron sputtering and characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ellipsometry. The nonlinear optical properties of these films were theoretically analyzed to assess their suitability for second-order nonlinear processes. We detail the fabrication and optical characterization of ZnS nanowaveguides, leading to the experimental observation of SHG in such structures. These findings establish ZnS as a promising platform for nonlinear photonic applications, particularly in compact and integrated frequency conversion devices. This work represents a significant step toward expanding the scope of wide bandgap semiconductors in advanced photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>High-quality Blazed Gratings through Synergy between E-Beam lithography and Robust Characterisation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining the highest quality and output of photon science in the VUV-, EUV-, soft- and tender-X-ray energy ranges requires high-quality blazed profile gratings. Currently, their availability is critical due to technological challenges and limited manufacturing resources. In this work we discuss the opportunity of an alternative method to manufacture blazed gratings by means of electron-beam lithography (EBL). We investigate the different parameters influencing the optical performance of blazed profile gratings produced by EBL and develop a robust process for the manufacturing of high-quality blazed gratings using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as high resolution, positive tone resist and ion beam etching.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Benchmarking of Remote Excitation in Plasmonic Sensing with Enhanced Signal-to-Noise Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote excitation using guided optical modes -- such as waveguides, fibers, or surface waves -- offers a promising alternative to direct optical excitation for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), particularly in applications requiring reduced heating, minimal invasiveness, and on-chip integration. However, despite its widespread use, systematic comparisons between remote and direct excitation remain limited. Here, we quantitatively benchmark both schemes by measuring power-dependent SERS responses from individual plasmonic nanogaps. We statistically analyze the maximum achievable SERS intensity before structural degradation, extract local temperatures, and evaluate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Our findings reveal that both remote and direct SERS share a common electric-field limit, despite exhibiting different levels of heating. This suggests that spectral evolution is primarily governed by the local electric field, which drives nanoscale atomic migration rather than excessive heating. Nonetheless, the lower heating associated with remote excitation enhances the Raman SNR by approximately 30%, improving measurement quality without compromising signal strength. This study establishes a quantitative framework for evaluating excitation strategies in plasmonic sensing, and challenges common assumptions about the role of heating in nanostructural stability under strong optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Plasmonic-Nanorod-Enhanced Lead-Free Inorganic Perovskite/Silicon Heterojunction Tandem Solar Cell Exceeding the Shockley-Queisser Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of sustainable and highly efficient energy conversion necessitates a transition from toxic and unstable materials to environmentally friendly alternatives. This work presents a simulation-based numerical investigation of a fully inorganic, lead-free tandem solar cell that employs cesium tin-germanium tri-iodide (CsSnGeI3) as the top cell absorber and crystalline silicon (c-Si) as the bottom cell absorber, configured in a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) arrangement. Utilizing CsSnGeI3 as a lead-free perovskite presents a promising solution to the toxicity concerns associated with conventional lead-based perovskites. To further increase near-infrared absorption and reduce the required thickness of the c-Si layer, an ultra-thin gallium antimonide auxiliary absorber is integrated into the SHJ bottom cell. Optical and electrical simulations, conducted using finite-difference time-domain and drift-diffusion modelling, demonstrate that the optimized tandem structure attains a power conversion efficiency of 34.93%, surpassing the Shockley-Queisser limit established for single-junction Si cells. Furthermore, the optimized device showcases an open-circuit voltage of 1.93 V, a short-circuit current density of 21.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 84.74%. Performance is additionally enhanced by incorporating cylindrical gold nanorods within a Si3N4 dielectric medium positioned at the rear of the bottom cell, thus amplifying light absorption through plasmonic effects. Notably, the tandem cell sustains high efficiency even without the plasmonic structure, thereby providing flexibility for cost-effective fabrication. This work underscores the viability of all-inorganic, lead-free tandem cells for next-generation photovoltaics, guided by simulated results that pave the way for high-efficiency, non-toxic solar energy solutions and further experimental validation.</description>

      <title>All-polarisation beamsplitters for interferometer applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical beamsplitters with similar properties for orthogonal, linear polarisation modes are required for realising polarisation-based speedmeter schemes to reduce back-action noise in gravitational-wave interferometers. In this paper, we investigate two beamsplitter coatings obtained from Laseroptik GmbH and Optoman on a best-effort basis that aim for a 50/50 power splitting ratio and equal overall phase shift for two orthogonal, linear polarisation modes interacting with the optic. We show that while Laseroptik GmbH opted for coating stack with 22 alternating layers of Ta2O5 and SiO2, Optoman produced a much thinner coating made of 5 SiO2 and SiOx (0 &lt; x &lt; 2) layers. With these strategies, the Laseroptik coating achieves an equal power reflectivity of 51% at 46 deg angle of incidence, and zero phase shift between both polarisations at 44.25 deg angle of incidence. The Optoman coating achieves power reflectivities of 49% for s-polarisation and 51% for p-polarisation with a differential phase shift around 5 deg largely independent of the angle of incidence.</description>

      <title>Probing Tensor Monopoles and Gerbe Invariants in Three-Dimensional Topological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that momentum-space tensor monopoles corresponding to nontrivial vector bundle generalizations, known as bundle gerbes, can be realized in bands of three-dimensional topological matter with nontrivial Hopf invariants. We provide a universal construction of tensor Berry connections in these topological phases, demonstrating how obstructions therein lead to $\mathbb{Z}$-quantized bulk magnetoelectric and nonlinear optical phenomena. We then pinpoint that these quantum effects are supported by intraband and interband torsion leading to nontrivial Dixmier-Douady classes in most known Hopf phases and in more general topological insulators realizing gerbe invariants falling beyond the tenfold classification of topological phases of matter. We furthermore provide an interacting generalization upon introducing many-body gerbe invariants by employing twisted boundary conditions. This opens an avenue to study gerbe invariants realized through higher-dimensional charge fractionalizations that can be electromagnetically probed.</description>

      <title>Large magnon dichroism and other optical properties of hexagonal ferrite h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 with altermagnetic A2 spin ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroic hexagonal h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 single crystals with non-collinear spins were studied using the THz and Raman scattering spectroscopies and ellipsometry. Antiferromagnetic resonances, or magnons, were found at about 0.85 THz and 1.2 THz. These magnons harden as temperature increases and disappear above 130 K. This behavior is consistent with the magnetic susceptibility and a phase transition to a previously reported weak ferromagnetic state. A strong dichroism at the resonance with the AFM doublet has been observed at zero external magnetic field using both conventional circular polarization and THz vector vortex beams. This observation is attributed to the strong altermagnetic properties of h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 with a broken PT symmetry. The splitting of the magnon doublet in an external magnetic field applied long the c axis yields a g-factor of 3.0 for the Fe3+ ions. Raman spectra of the optical phonons revealed a Fano-type asymmetry due to their interaction with a continuum of polar excitations. Electronic transitions were studied with ellipsometry and the results were compared with the modelled using DFT+eDMFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Basic quantum effects are often illustrated using single particle interferences in two-path interferometers. A wider range of non-classical phenomena can be illustrated using three-path interferometers, but the increased complexity of quantum statistics in a three-dimensional Hilbert space makes it difficult to identify a representative set of observable properties that could be used to characterize specific phenomena. Here, I propose a characterization of pure states based on a five-stage interferometer recently introduced to demonstrate the relation between different measurement contexts (Optica Quantum 1, 63 (2023)). It is shown that the orthogonality relations between the states representing the different measurement contexts can be used to classify pure states within the three-dimensional Hilbert space according to the non-classical correlations between different contexts expressed by negative Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.</description>

      <title>Use of solid fused silica etalon with broadband metallic coatings for calibration of high-resolution optical spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavelength calibration is a key factor for high-resolution spectroscopic measurements for precision radial velocities. Hollow-cathode lamps (e.g., ThAr), absorption cells (e.g., iodine cell), dielectric coated Fabry-P\'erot etalons and laser frequency combs have been implemented over the years for precise wavelength calibration and wavelength drift measurements. However, due to their various impediments as wavelength calibrators, investigations of alternative methods remain of prime interest. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of low-cost (~ $1000) commercially available solid fused silica etalon with a broadband metallic coating as a calibrator. We studied the behaviour for two cavity spacings (free spectral range of 1/cm and 0.5/cm) with temperature from theoretical derivation and experimental data. Our setup had a temperature stability of 0.8 mK for a calibrator system using an off-the-shelf dewar flask with active stabilisation. Our result from radial velocity drift measurements demonstrated that such a calibration system is capable of providing higher signal-to-noise calibration and better nightly drift measurement relative to ThAr in the wavelength range between 470 nm and 780 nm. A similar result has been previously found for Fabry-P\'erot etalons, and although the metalon solution lacks the efficiency of an etalon, it does offers a cost-effective broadband solution, which should be less prone to aging relative to complex dielectric mirror coatings. Nonetheless, long-term monitoring is required to understand the metalon behaviour in detail.</description>

      <title>Quantum siphoning of finely spaced interlayer excitons in reconstructed MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic reconstruction in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures leads to mesoscopic domains with uniform atomic registry, profoundly altering the local potential landscape. While interlayer excitons in these domains exhibit strong many-body interactions, extent and impact of quantum confinement on their dynamics remains unclear. Here, we reveal that quantum confinement persists in these flat, reconstructed regions. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy uncovers multiple, finely-spaced interlayer exciton states (~ 1 meV separation), and correlated emission lifetimes spanning sub-nanosecond to over 100 nanoseconds across a 10 meV energy window. Cascade-like transitions confirm that these states originate from a single potential well, further supported by calculations. Remarkably, at high excitation rates, we observe transient suppression of emission followed by gradual recovery, a process we term "quantum siphoning". Our results demonstrate that quantum confinement and competing nonlinear dynamics persist beyond the ideal moire paradigm, potentially enabling applications in quantum sensing and modifying exciton dynamics via strain engineering.</description>

Abstract: Light detection and ranging is a key technology for a number of applications, from relatively simple distance ranging to environmental monitoring. When dealing with low photon numbers an important issue is the improvement of the signal- to-noise-ratio, which is severely affected by external sources whose emission is captured by the detection apparatus. In this paper, we present an extension of the technique developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 203601] to the effects caused by the propagation of light through a turbulent media, as well as the detection through photon counting devices bearing imperfections in terms of efficiency and number resolution. Our results indicate that even less performing technology can result in a useful detection scheme.</description>

      <title>Cation Engineering of Cu-Doped CsPbI3: Lead Substitution and Dimensional Reduction for Improved Scintillation Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystals show promising contributions in emerging luminescent materials due to their high tolerance to defects. In particular, the development of cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) has shown its efficiency for light-harvesting properties. However, further implementation is hindered due to the toxicity of the lead content. Therefore, in this study, we introduced Cu atoms to partially substitute Pb atoms (5% Cu) in the CsPbI3 lattice as a solution to reduce Pb toxicity. A partial lead material is substituted using Cu displays a larger Stokes shift (-67 nm) compared to the pristine, and resulted doped CsPbI3 not undergo the undesired self absorption. An outcome is focused on the champion of fast-component (tau_1) decay time ~0.6 ns. Temperature-dependent radioluminescence outlines an incremental change in the emission intensity is marginally centered at 713 +- 16 nm, which indicates Cu-doped CsPbI3 is not greatly affected by temperature. In addition, we report that the light yield (LY) pristine CsPbI3 after doping is increased to 3.0 +- 0.8 photons/keV. Our work provides physical insights into a tunable scintillation property using transition metal doping toward lead-free based scintillating perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate single-photon nonlinear refractive index change and frequency shift of Epsilon-Near-Zero (ENZ) sub-wavelength nanocavities. We apply the rigorous quantum Langevin-noise approach in the framework of Green's tensor quantization method to realistic ENZ materials with causal dispersion and derive closed-form analytical solutions for cavities with spherical geometry. This is achieved by employing a fully nonperturbative methodology for the analysis of open quantum systems with single-photon Kerr-type nonlinearity. The analytical results are validated numerically using the established quasi-normal mode expansion method and extended to nonspherical nanocavity geometries that can be experimentally fabricated using state-of-the-art electron lithography. Our findings establish a rigorous benchmark for understanding single-photon nonlinear optical effects in Kerr-type ENZ nanostructures with losses and are of importance to emerging quantum technology applications, including on-chip single-photon nondemolition detection, quantum sensing, and controlled quantum gates driven by enhanced photon blockade effects at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>FDTD with Auxiliary Bath Fields for Condensed-Phase Polaritonics: Fundamentals and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding condensed-phase polariton experiments requires accurately accounting for both realistic cavity geometries and the interplay between polaritons and material dark modes arising from microscopic molecular interactions. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach numerically propagates classical Maxwell's equations in the time domain, offering a versatile scheme for modeling polaritons in realistic cavities. However, the simple dielectric functions routinely used in FDTD often fail to describe molecular details. Consequently, standard FDTD calculations, to date, cannot accurately describe processes involving the complex coupling between polaritons and dark modes, such as polariton relaxation, transport, and condensation. For more faithful simulations of the energy flow between polaritons and dark modes, herein, local bath degrees of freedom coupled to the material polarization are explicitly included in FDTD to describe the dark-mode dynamics. This method -- FDTD with auxiliary bath fields (FDTD-Bath) -- is implemented in the open-source MEEP package by adding a Lorentz-Bath material susceptibility, where explicit bath modes are coupled to conventional Lorentz oscillators. With this Lorentz-Bath susceptibility, linear polariton spectra and Rabi-splitting-dependent polariton relaxation rates in planar Fabry--P\'erot cavities are reproduced more accurately than those with the conventional Lorentz susceptibility. Supported by a user-friendly Python interface and efficient MPI parallelism, the FDTD-Bath approach implemented in MEEP is ready to model a wide range of polariton phenomena involving realistic cavity geometries.</description>

      <title>Doppler Pulse Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to amplify ultrashort pulses has revolutionized modern laser science, driving advances in various fields such as ultrafast optics and spectroscopy. A pivotal development in this field is chirped pulse amplification (CPA), which stretches, amplifies and recompresses ultrashort optical pulses using dispersive elements to overcome amplification limits. However, CPA faces limitations due to gain narrowing, restricting the final pulse duration. Here, we propose Doppler pulse amplification (DoPA), a novel approach for amplifying ultrashort pulses. While DoPA shares similarities with CPA in that it also stretches, amplifies and recompresses pulses, it differs in how it achieves temporal compansion. Unlike CPA, DoPA exploits Doppler shifts induced by space-time modulated interfaces through a space-time wedge implementation without chirping. We show that DoPA dynamically shifts the pulse spectrum, effectively mitigating the gain narrowing issue of CPA. Additionally, we show that DoPA enables more compact amplification systems via a space-time Fresnel implementation, enabling amplification of picosecond and femtosecond pulses. This approach may pave the way for more efficient, high-intensity laser systems and expand the potential for applications in both laboratory research and practical environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of the first 24-mode universal photonic processor (UPP) realized through femtosecond laser writing (FLW), marking the most complex UPP demonstrated to date. Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.7 %. This work establishes FLW-based integrated photonics as a scalable and robust platform for advancing quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.</description>
