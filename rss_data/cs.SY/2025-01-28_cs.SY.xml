      <title>A causal learning approach to in-orbit inertial parameter estimation for multi-payload deployers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses an approach to inertial parameter estimation for the case of cargo carrying spacecraft that is based on causal learning, i.e. learning from the responses of the spacecraft, under actuation. Different spacecraft configurations (inertial parameter sets) are simulated under different actuation profiles, in order to produce an optimised time-series clustering classifier that can be used to distinguish between them. The actuation is comprised of finite sequences of constant inputs that are applied in order, based on typical actuators available. By learning from the system's responses across multiple input sequences, and then applying measures of time-series similarity and F1-score, an optimal actuation sequence can be chosen either for one specific system configuration or for the overall set of possible configurations. This allows for both estimation of the inertial parameter set without any prior knowledge of state, as well as validation of transitions between different configurations after a deployment event. The optimisation of the actuation sequence is handled by a reinforcement learning model that uses the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm, by repeatedly trying different sequences and evaluating the impact on classifier performance according to a multi-objective metric.</description>

      <title>What is a Relevant Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Numerical Differentiation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In applications that involve sensor data, a useful measure of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio of the root-mean-squared (RMS) signal to the RMS sensor noise. The present paper shows that, for numerical differentiation, the traditional SNR is ineffective. In particular, it is shown that, for a harmonic signal with harmonic sensor noise, a natural and relevant SNR is given by the ratio of the RMS of the derivative of the signal to the RMS of the derivative of the sensor noise. For a harmonic signal with white sensor noise, an effective SNR is derived. Implications of these observations for signal processing are discussed.</description>

      <title>Automatic Link Selection in Multi-Channel Multiple Access with Link Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of automatic link selection in multi-channel multiple access control using bandit feedback. In particular, a controller assigns multiple users to multiple channels in a time slotted system, where in each time slot at most one user can be assigned to a given channel and at most one channel can be assigned to a given user. Given that user $i$ is assigned to channel $j$, the transmission fails with a fixed probability $f_{i,j}$. The failure probabilities are not known to the controller. The assignments are made dynamically using success/failure feedback. The goal is to maximize the time average utility, where we consider an arbitrary (possibly nonsmooth) concave and entrywise nondecreasing utility function. The problem of merely maximizing the total throughput has a solution of always assigning the same user-channel pairs and can be unfair to certain users, particularly when the number of channels is less than the number of users. Instead, our scheme allows various types of fairness, such as proportional fairness, maximizing the minimum, or combinations of these by defining the appropriate utility function. We propose two algorithms for this task. The first algorithm is adaptive and gets within $\mathcal{O}(\log(T)/T^{1/3})$ of optimality over any interval of $T$ consecutive slots over which the success probabilities do not change. The second algorithm has faster $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log(T)/T})$ performance over the first $T$ slots, but does not adapt well if probabilities change.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes various approaches to modeling a random process with a given rational power spectral density. The main attention is paid to the spectral form of mathematical description, which allows one to obtain a relation for the shaping filter using a transfer function without any additional calculations.

      <title>DER Hosting capacity for distribution networks: definitions, attributes, use-cases and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs) has outpaced grid modernization, leading to capacity limitations that challenge their further integration. Hosting Capacity Assessment (HCA) is a critical tool for evaluating how much DER capacity a grid can handle without breaching operational limits. HCA serves multiple goals: enabling higher DER penetration, accelerating grid connection times, guiding infrastructure upgrades or flexible resource deployment, ensuring equitable policies, and improving grid flexibility while minimizing curtailment. HCA lacks a universal definition, varying by modelling approaches, uncertainty considerations, and objectives. This paper addresses five key questions to standardize and enhance HCA practices. First, it classifies HCA objectives associated with different stakeholders such as system operators, consumers, market operators and consumers. Second, it examines model attributes, including modelling sophistication, data requirements, and uncertainty handling, thus balancing complexity with computational efficiency. Third, it explores HCA applications, such as planning grid investments or operational decisions, and summarizes use cases associated with HCA. Fourth, it emphasizes the need for periodic updates to reflect dynamic grid conditions, evolving technologies, and new DER installations. Finally, it identifies challenges, such as ensuring data quality, managing computational demands, and aligning short-term and long-term goals. By addressing these aspects, this paper provides a structured approach to perform and apply HCA, offering insights for engineers, planners, and policymakers to manage DER integration effectively.</description>

      <title>Learning-Enhanced Safeguard Control for High-Relative-Degree Systems: Robust Optimization under Disturbances and Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merely pursuing performance may adversely affect the safety, while a conservative policy for safe exploration will degrade the performance. How to balance the safety and performance in learning-based control problems is an interesting yet challenging issue. This paper aims to enhance system performance with safety guarantee in solving the reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal control problems of nonlinear systems subject to high-relative-degree state constraints and unknown time-varying disturbance/actuator faults. First, to combine control barrier functions (CBFs) with RL, a new type of CBFs, termed high-order reciprocal control barrier function (HO-RCBF) is proposed to deal with high-relative-degree constraints during the learning process. Then, the concept of gradient similarity is proposed to quantify the relationship between the gradient of safety and the gradient of performance. Finally, gradient manipulation and adaptive mechanisms are introduced in the safe RL framework to enhance the performance with a safety guarantee. Two simulation examples illustrate that the proposed safe RL framework can address high-relative-degree constraint, enhance safety robustness and improve system performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing-based Re-design of Adaptive Observer for Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic regressor extension and mixing procedure is employed to redesign a conventional adaptive observer algorithm for affine systems. A reduced-order observer is designed without the construction of the state transition matrix. The dynamics of the regressor are redesigned to incorporate feedback from its extension, transforming the regressor dynamics into a perturbed damped nonlinear oscillator form. This introduces some flexibility in reducing the degradation of parameter convergence due to the lack of the transition matrix and in enhancing the excitation property of the extension matrix.</description>

      <title>Nuisance-free Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System Design: Merging Exponential-CBF and Adaptive Sliding Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of the automatic ground collision avoidance system (Auto-GCAS) has been proven by considering the fatal crashes that have occurred over decades. Even though extensive efforts have been put forth to address the ground collision avoidance in the literature, the notion of being nuisance-free has not been sufficiently addressed. At this point, in this study, the Auto-GCAS design is formulated by merging exponential control barrier functions with sliding manifolds to manipulate the barrier function dynamics. The adaptive properties of the sliding manifolds are tailored to the key and governing flight parameters, ensuring that the nuisance-free requirement is satisfied. Furthermore, to ensure all safety requirements are met, a flight envelope protection algorithm is designed using control barrier functions to assess the commands generated by the Auto-GCAS. Eventually, the performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated, focusing on authority-sharing, collision avoidance capability, and nuisance-free operation through various scenarios and Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Intuition and importance of feedback control through laboratory experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to raise awareness among engineering students from different disciplines on the importance of feedback control. The proposal consists in comparing the performance of different control strategies in a laboratory session, considering Matlab/Simulink simulations of the non-linear pendulum model. First, students attempt to make the pendulum stop at unstable equilibrium by controlling the torque input with a joystick connected to the computer via an Arduino board. Different friction scenarios are considered for students to explore the dissipation in the system response. Then, as a second task, the Arduino is used to introduce the position reference, while students implement different control strategies, such as Bang-Bang, PID (proportional-integral-derivative) and FPID (fractional PID) controllers, analyzing the system response by inspecting the signals in a scope and in a 3D animated model. The dynamic model results as an application of the laws of rotational motion, and the control methods are explained from an intuitive point of view, focusing on the meaning and motivation of the control actions, with the intention to develop intuition about PID and FPID control methods.</description>

      <title>FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

      <title>Mode Switching-Induced Instability of Multi-source Feed DC Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In DC microgrids (DCMGs), DC-bus signaling based control strategy is extensively used for power management, where mode switching plays a crucial role in achieving multi-source coordination. However, few studies have noticed the impact of mode switching and switching strategies on system voltage stability. To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide a general analysis framework for mode switching-induced instability in multi-source DCMGs. First, manifold theory is employed to analyze the stability of the DCMG switched system. Subsequently, the instability mechanism and its physical interpretation are explored. The positive feedback activated by the decreasing DC bus voltage during the switching process leads to instability. Switching strategy may inadvertently contribute to this instability. To improve stability, a novel control method based on mode scheduling is proposed, by adjusting switching strategy and thereby correcting the system trajectory. Finally, both real-time simulations and experimental tests on a DCMG system verify the correctness and effectiveness of theoretical analysis results.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process-Based Prediction and Control of Hammerstein-Wiener Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates data-driven prediction and control of Hammerstein-Wiener systems using physics-informed Gaussian process models. Data-driven prediction algorithms have been developed for structured nonlinear systems based on Willems' fundamental lemma. However, existing frameworks cannot treat output nonlinearities and require a dictionary of basis functions for Hammerstein systems. In this work, an implicit predictor structure is considered, leveraging the multi-step-ahead ARX structure for the linear part of the model. This implicit function is learned by Gaussian process regression with kernel functions designed from Gaussian process priors for the nonlinearities. The linear model parameters are estimated as hyperparameters by assuming a stable spline hyperprior. The implicit Gaussian process model provides explicit output prediction by optimizing selected optimality criteria. The model is also applied to receding horizon control with the expected control cost and chance constraint satisfaction guarantee. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed prediction and control algorithms are superior to black-box Gaussian process models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an early software integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Model Predictive Control (MPC). Our aim is to make recent theoretical contributions from the literature more accessible to both the RL and MPC communities. We combine standard software tools developed by the RL community, such as Gymnasium, stable-baselines3, or CleanRL with the acados toolbox, a widely-used software package for efficient MPC algorithms. Our core contribution is MPC4RL, an open-source Python package that supports learning-enhanced MPC schemes for existing acados implementations. The package is designed to be modular, extensible, and user-friendly, facilitating the tuning of MPC algorithms for a broad range of control problems. It is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous distributed collision avoidance with intention consensus for inland autonomous ships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of collaborative collision avoidance for autonomous inland ships. Two solutions are provided to solve the problem in a distributed manner. We first present a distributed model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that allows ships to directly negotiate their intention to avoid collision in a synchronous communication framework. Moreover, we introduce a new approach to shape the ship's behavior to follow the waterway traffic regulations. The conditional convergence toward a stationary solution of this algorithm is guaranteed by the theory of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). To overcome the problem of asynchronous communication between ships, we adopt a new asynchronous nonlinear ADMM and present an asynchronous distributed MPC algorithm based on it. Several simulations and field experiments show that the proposed algorithms can prevent ship collisions even in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of an unstable reaction-diffusion PDE with input delay despite state and input quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the global asymptotic stability problem of an unstable reaction-diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) subject to input delay and state quantization developing a switched predictor-feedback law. To deal with the input delay, we reformulate the problem as an actuated transport PDE coupled with the original reaction-diffusion PDE. Then, we design a quantized predictor-based feedback mechanism that employs a dynamic switching strategy to adjust the quantization range and error over time. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven properly combining backstepping with a small-gain approach and input-to-state stability techniques, for deriving estimates on solutions, despite the quantization effect and the system's instability. We also extend this result to the input quantization case.</description>

      <title>Impact of Lead Time on Aggregate EV Flexibility for Congestion Management Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increased electrification of energy end-usage can lead to network congestion during periods of high consumption. Flexibility of loads, such as aggregate smart charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs), is increasingly leveraged to manage grid congestion through various market-based mechanisms. Under such an arrangement, this paper quantifies the effect of lead time on the aggregate flexibility of EV fleets. Simulations using real-world charging transactions spanning over different categories of charging stations are performed for two flexibility products (redispatch and capacity limitations) when offered along with different business-as-usual (BAU) schedules. Results show that the variation of tradable flexibility depends mainly on the BAU schedules, the duration of the requested flexibility, and its start time. Further, the implication of these flexibility products on the average energy costs and emissions is also studied for different cases. Simulations show that bidirectional (V2G) charging outperforms unidirectional smart charging in all cases.</description>

      <title>Graphene-Assisted Chemical Stabilization of Liquid Metal Nano Droplets for Liquid Metal Based Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy storage devices with liquid_metal electrodes have attracted interest in recent years due to their potential for mechanical resilience, self_healing, dendrite_free operation, and fast reaction kinetics. Gallium alloys like Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point and high theoretical specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable in highly alkaline electrolytes due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this letter, this bottleneck is addressed by introducing chemically stable films in which nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated with trace amounts of graphene oxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn weight ratio as low as 0.01 provides enough protection for a thin film formed by GO EGaIn nanocomposite against significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH 1-14). It is shown that GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability in such environments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x. Microstructural analysis confirms GO EGaIn composite stability and enhanced electrochemical performance. Utilizing this, a thin film supercapacitor is fabricated. Results indicate that when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio of 0.001 the areal capacitance improves by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm_2. This breakthrough paves the way for advanced liquid metal-based thin film electrodes, promising significant improvements in energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Similarity Index for Assessing Voltage Source Behaviour in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the fundamental transition to a power electronic dominated power system, the increasing diversity of dynamic elements underscores the need to assess their similarity to mature electrical engineering models. This article addresses the concept of the Dynamic Similarity Index (DSI) for its use in, power electronics-dominated networks. The DSI is a multipurpose tool developed to be used by different stakeholders (e.g., converter manufacturers and system operators). Such an index is calculated per frequency, which serves to anticipate potential differences in particular frequency ranges of interest between the model under study and the reference model. Within the scope of this study, the dynamic similarity of inverter-based generators to an ideal voltage source behind an impedance is assessed, due to the relevance of this fundamental circuit in the representation of generation units in power system studies. The article presents two potential applications based on this mathematical framework. First, for manufacturers to evaluate control performance compared to a reference model and second, it enables operators to diagnose buses with voltage vulnerability based on a user-defined reference Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR) value. The DSI results for these two case studies are validated using Matlab Simulink simulations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cooperative Co-Evolution Algorithm for Deadlock-prone Distributed Assembly Flowshop Scheduling with Limited buffers Using Petri nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distributed assembly flowshop scheduling problem (DAFSP) can be applied to immense manufacturing environments. In DAFSP, jobs are first processed in distributed flowshops, and then assembled into final products by an assembly machine, which usually has limited buffers in practical application. This limited capacity can lead to deadlocks, halting job completion and blocking the entire manufacturing process. However, existing scheduling methods fail to address these deadlocks in DAFSP effectively. As such, we develop a hybrid cooperative co-evolution (HCCE) algorithm for solving the deadlock-prone DAFSP by minimizing the makespan. For the first time, we use Petri nets to analyze the deadlocks in DAFSP and propose a Petri net-based deadlock amending method (IDAM), which is further integrated into HCCE to ensure the feasibility (i.e., deadlock-freeness) of solutions. Importantly, HCCE contains an elite archive (EAR) and two subpopulations. It uses the problem-specific operators for heuristic initialization and global-search. To enhance the quality and diversity of solutions, an information transfer mechanism (ITM) is developed among subpopulation and EAR, and four local-search operators are performed sequentially on each individual in EAR. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HCCE algorithm.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted MEC Architecture for Collaborative Task Offloading in Urban IoT Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to meet the increasing demands and computing limitations of complex Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, implementing MEC in urban environments can be challenging due to factors like high device density, complex infrastructure, and limited network coverage. Network congestion and connectivity issues can adversely affect user satisfaction. Hence, in this article, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted collaborative MEC architecture to facilitate task offloading of IoT devices in urban environments. We utilize the combined capabilities of UAVs and ground edge servers (ESs) to maximize user satisfaction and thereby also maximize the service provider's (SP) profit. We design IoT task-offloading as joint IoT-UAV-ES association and UAV-network topology optimization problem. Due to NP-hard nature, we break the problem into two subproblems: offload strategy optimization and UAV topology optimization. We develop a Three-sided Matching with Size and Cyclic preference (TMSC) based task offloading algorithm to find stable association between IoTs, UAVs, and ESs to achieve system objective. We also propose a K-means based iterative algorithm to decide the minimum number of UAVs and their positions to provide offloading services to maximum IoTs in the system. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed task offloading scheme over benchmark schemes through simulation-based evaluation. The proposed scheme outperforms by 19%, 12%, and 25% on average in terms of percentage of served IoTs, average user satisfaction, and SP profit, respectively, with 25% lesser UAVs, making it an effective solution to support IoT task requirements in urban environments using UAV-assisted MEC architecture.</description>

      <title>Extracting Forward Invariant Sets from Neural Network-Based Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training Neural Networks (NNs) to serve as Barrier Functions (BFs) is a popular way to improve the safety of autonomous dynamical systems. Despite significant practical success, these methods are not generally guaranteed to produce true BFs in a provable sense, which undermines their intended use as safety certificates. In this paper, we consider the problem of formally certifying a learned NN as a BF with respect to state avoidance for an autonomous system: viz. computing a region of the state space on which the candidate NN is provably a BF. In particular, we propose a sound algorithm that efficiently produces such a certificate set for a shallow NN. Our algorithm combines two novel approaches: it first uses NN reachability tools to identify a subset of states for which the output of the NN does not increase along system trajectories; then, it uses a novel enumeration algorithm for hyperplane arrangements to find the intersection of the NN's zero-sub-level set with the first set of states. In this way, our algorithm soundly finds a subset of states on which the NN is certified as a BF. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm at certifying for real-world NNs as BFs in two case studies. We complemented these with scalability experiments that demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest for secure and reliable random number generation, Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have emerged as a promising technology due to their unique ability to exploit the stochastic nature of magnetization switching. This paper presents an engineering-oriented design of a drift-resilient MTJ-based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) utilizing a hybrid control strategy. We address the critical issue of switching probability drift, which can compromise the randomness and bias the output of MTJ-based TRNGs. Our approach combines a self-stabilization strategy, which dynamically adjusts the driving voltage based on real-time feedback, with pulse width modulation to enhance control over the switching probability. Through comprehensive experimental and simulation results, we demonstrate significant improvements in the stability, uniformity, and quality of the random numbers generated. The proposed system offers flexibility and adaptability for diverse applications, making it a reliable solution for high-quality randomness in cryptography, secure communications, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Predictive Lagrangian Optimization for Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained optimization is popularly seen in reinforcement learning for addressing complex control tasks. From the perspective of dynamic system, iteratively solving a constrained optimization problem can be framed as the temporal evolution of a feedback control system. Classical constrained optimization methods, such as penalty and Lagrangian approaches, inherently use proportional and integral feedback controllers. In this paper, we propose a more generic equivalence framework to build the connection between constrained optimization and feedback control system, for the purpose of developing more effective constrained RL algorithms. Firstly, we define that each step of the system evolution determines the Lagrange multiplier by solving a multiplier feedback optimal control problem (MFOCP). In this problem, the control input is multiplier, the state is policy parameters, the dynamics is described by policy gradient descent, and the objective is to minimize constraint violations. Then, we introduce a multiplier guided policy learning (MGPL) module to perform policy parameters updating. And we prove that the resulting optimal policy, achieved through alternating MFOCP and MGPL, aligns with the solution of the primal constrained RL problem, thereby establishing our equivalence framework. Furthermore, we point out that the existing PID Lagrangian is merely one special case within our framework that utilizes a PID controller. We also accommodate the integration of other various feedback controllers, thereby facilitating the development of new algorithms. As a representative, we employ model predictive control (MPC) as the feedback controller and consequently propose a new algorithm called predictive Lagrangian optimization (PLO). Numerical experiments demonstrate its superiority over the PID Lagrangian method, achieving a larger feasible region up to 7.2% and a comparable average reward.</description>

      <title>FAVbot: An Autonomous Target Tracking Micro-Robot with Frequency Actuation Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic autonomy at centimeter scale requires compact and miniaturization-friendly actuation integrated with sensing and neural network processing assembly within a tiny form factor. Applications of such systems have witnessed significant advancements in recent years in fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, and post-disaster rescue. The system design at this scale puts stringent constraints on power consumption for both the sensory front-end and actuation back-end and the weight of the electronic assembly for robust operation. In this paper, we introduce FAVbot, the first autonomous mobile micro-robotic system integrated with a novel actuation mechanism and convolutional neural network (CNN) based computer vision - all integrated within a compact 3-cm form factor. The novel actuation mechanism utilizes mechanical resonance phenomenon to achieve frequency-controlled steering with a single piezoelectric actuator. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FAVbot's frequency-controlled actuation, which offers a diverse selection of resonance modes with different motion characteristics. The actuation system is complemented with the vision front-end where a camera along with a microcontroller supports object detection for closed-loop control and autonomous target tracking. This enables adaptive navigation in dynamic environments. This work contributes to the evolving landscape of neural network-enabled micro-robotic systems showing the smallest autonomous robot built using controllable multi-directional single-actuator mechanism.</description>

      <title>One Model to Forecast Them All and in Entity Distributions Bind Them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting in power systems often involves multi-entity datasets like households, feeders, and wind turbines, where generating reliable entity-specific forecasts presents significant challenges. Traditional approaches require training individual models for each entity, making them inefficient and hard to scale. This study addresses this problem using GUIDE-VAE, a conditional variational autoencoder that allows entity-specific probabilistic forecasting using a single model. GUIDE-VAE provides flexible outputs, ranging from interpretable point estimates to full probability distributions, thanks to its advanced covariance composition structure. These distributions capture uncertainty and temporal dependencies, offering richer insights than traditional methods. To evaluate our GUIDE-VAE-based forecaster, we use household electricity consumption data as a case study due to its multi-entity and highly stochastic nature. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE-VAE outperforms conventional quantile regression techniques across key metrics while ensuring scalability and versatility. These features make GUIDE-VAE a powerful and generalizable tool for probabilistic forecasting tasks, with potential applications beyond household electricity consumption.</description>

      <title>Integrating Personalized Federated Learning with Control Systems for Enhanced Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the expanding field of machine learning, federated learning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for distributed data environments, ensuring privacy while leveraging decentralized data sources. However, the heterogeneity of client data and the need for tailored models necessitate the integration of personalization techniques to enhance learning efficacy and model performance. This paper introduces a novel framework that amalgamates personalized federated learning with robust control systems, aimed at optimizing both the learning process and the control of data flow across diverse networked environments. Our approach harnesses personalized algorithms that adapt to the unique characteristics of each client's data, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of the model for individual nodes without compromising the overall system performance. To manage and control the learning process across the network, we employ a sophisticated control system that dynamically adjusts the parameters based on real-time feedback and system states, ensuring stability and efficiency. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that our integrated system not only outperforms standard federated learning models in terms of accuracy and learning speed but also maintains system integrity and robustness in face of varying network conditions and data distributions. The experimental results, obtained from a multi-client simulated environment with non-IID data distributions, underscore the benefits of integrating control systems into personalized federated learning frameworks, particularly in scenarios demanding high reliability and precision.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Online Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning for nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, the ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of the classical control theory is the assumption that the state space and its dimension do not change with time. This prevents analyzing and even formalizing the stability and control problems for open multi-agent systems whose agents may enter or leave the network, industrial processes where the sensors or actuators may be exchanged frequently, smart grids, etc. In this work, we propose a framework of live systems that covers a rather general class of systems with a time-varying state space. We argue that input-to-state stability is a proper stability notion for this class of systems, and many of the classic tools and results, such as Lyapunov methods and superposition theorems, can be extended to this setting.</description>

Abstract: Instruction-based computer control agents (CCAs) execute complex action sequences on personal computers or mobile devices to fulfill tasks using the same graphical user interfaces as a human user would, provided instructions in natural language. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of instruction-based computer control, examining available agents -- their taxonomy, development, and respective resources -- and emphasizing the shift from manually designed, specialized agents to leveraging foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We formalize the problem and establish a taxonomy of the field to analyze agents from three perspectives: (a) the environment perspective, analyzing computer environments; (b) the interaction perspective, describing observations spaces (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action spaces (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions, executable code); and (c) the agent perspective, focusing on the core principle of how an agent acts and learns to act. Our framework encompasses both specialized and foundation agents, facilitating their comparative analysis and revealing how prior solutions in specialized agents, such as an environment learning step, can guide the development of more capable foundation agents. Additionally, we review current CCA datasets and CCA evaluation methods and outline the challenges to deploying such agents in a productive setting. In total, we review and classify 86 CCAs and 33 related datasets. By highlighting trends, limitations, and future research directions, this work presents a comprehensive foundation to obtain a broad understanding of the field and push its future development.</description>

      <title>Active Hypothesis Testing for Quantum Detection of Phase-Shift Keying Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum detection of Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)-coded coherent states through the lens of active hypothesis testing, focusing on a Dolinar-like receiver with constraints on displacement amplitude and energy. With coherent state slicing, we formulate the problem as a controlled sensing task in which observation kernels have parameters shrinking with sample size. The constrained open-loop error exponent and a corresponding upper bound on the Bayesian error probability are proven. Surprisingly, the exponent-optimal open-loop policy for binary PSK with high dark counts is not simply time-sharing. This work serves as a first step towards obtaining analytical insights through the active hypothesis testing framework for designing resource-constrained quantum communication receivers.</description>

      <title>SP-IMPact: A Framework for Static Partitioning Interference Mitigation and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern embedded systems are evolving toward complex, heterogeneous architectures to accommodate increasingly demanding applications. Driven by SWAP-C constraints, this shift has led to consolidating multiple systems onto single hardware platforms. Static Partitioning Hypervisors offer a promising solution to partition hardware resources and provide spatial isolation between critical workloads. However, shared resources like the Last-Level Cache and system bus can introduce temporal interference between virtual machines (VMs), negatively impacting performance and predictability. Over the past decade, academia and industry have developed interference mitigation techniques, such as cache partitioning and memory bandwidth reservation. However, configuring these techniques is complex and time-consuming. Cache partitioning requires balancing cache sections across VMs, while memory bandwidth reservation needs tuning bandwidth budgets and periods. Testing all configurations is impractical and often leads to suboptimal results. Moreover, understanding how these techniques interact is limited, as their combined use can produce compounded or conflicting effects on performance. Static analysis tools estimating worst-case execution times offer guidance for configuring mitigation techniques but often fail to capture the complexity of modern multi-core systems. They typically focus on limited shared resources while neglecting others, such as IOMMUs and interrupt controllers. To address these challenges, we present SP-IMPact, an open-source framework for analyzing and guiding interference mitigation configurations. SP-IMPact supports (i) cache coloring and (ii) memory bandwidth reservation, while evaluating their interactions and cumulative impact. By providing insights on real hardware, SP-IMPact helps optimize configurations for mixed-criticality systems, ensuring performance and predictability.</description>

      <title>The Third Evolution Equation for Optimal Control Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.04663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Variation Evolving Method (VEM) that originates from the continuous-time dynamics stability theory seeks the optimal solutions with variation evolution principle. After establishing the first and the second evolution equations within its frame, the third evolution equation is developed. This equation only solves the control variables along the variation time to get the optimal solution, and its definite conditions may be arbitrary since the equation can eliminate possible infeasibilities. With this equation, the dimension of the resulting Initial-value Problem (IVP), transformed via the semi-discrete method, is greatly reduced. Therefore it might relieve the computation burden in seeking solutions. Illustrative examples are solved and it is shown that the proposed equation may produce more precise numerical solutions than the second evolution equation, and its computation time may be shorter for the dense discretization.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quasi Time-Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Soft Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.02994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many mechatronic applications, controller input costs are negligible and time optimality is of great importance to maximize the productivity by executing fast positioning maneuvers. As a result, the obtained control input has mostly a bang-bang nature, which excite undesired mechanical vibrations, especially in systems with flexible structures. This paper tackles the time-optimal control problem and proposes a novel approach, which explicitly addresses the vibrational behavior in the context of the receding horizon technique. Such technique is a key feature, especially for systems with a time-varying vibrational behavior. In the context of model predictive control (MPC), vibrational behavior is predicted and coped in a soft-constrained formulation, which penalize any violation of undesired vibrations. This formulation enlarges the feasibility on a wide operating range in comparison with a hard-constrained formulation. The closed-loop performance of this approach is demonstrated on a numerical example of stacker crane with high degree of flexibility.</description>

      <title>Causality-based Cost Allocation for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in Distribution System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While peer-to-peer energy trading has the potential to harness the capabilities of small-scale energy resources, a peer-matching process often overlooks power grid conditions, yielding increased losses, line congestion, and voltage problems. This imposes a great challenge on the distribution system operator (DSO), which can eventually limit peer-to-peer energy trading. To align the peer-matching process with the physical grid conditions, this paper proposes a cost causality-based network cost allocation method and the grid-aware peer-matching process. Building on the cost causality principle, the proposed model utilizes the network cost (loss, congestion, and voltage) as a signal to encourage peers to adjust their preferences ensuring that matches are more in line with grid conditions, leading to enhanced social welfare. Additionally, this paper presents mathematical proof showing the superiority of the causality-based cost allocation over existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Research on control using models based on machine-learning methods has now shifted to the practical engineering stage. Achieving high performance and theoretically guaranteeing the safety of the system is critical for such applications. In this paper, we propose a learning method for exactly linearizable dynamical models that can easily apply various control theories to ensure stability, reliability, etc., and to provide a high degree of freedom of expression. As an example, we present a design that combines simple linear control and control barrier functions. The proposed model is employed for the real-time control of an automotive engine, and the results demonstrate good predictive performance and stable control under constraints.</description>

      <title>Antifragile Perimeter Control: Anticipating and Gaining from Disruptions with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal operation of transportation networks is often susceptible to unexpected disruptions, such as traffic incidents and social events. Many established control strategies rely on mathematical models that struggle to cope with real-world uncertainties, leading to a significant decline in effectiveness when faced with substantial disruptions. While previous research works have dedicated efforts to improving the robustness or resilience of transportation systems against disruptions, this paper applies the cutting-edge concept of antifragility to better design a traffic control strategy for urban road networks. Antifragility sets itself apart from robustness and resilience as it represents a system's ability to not only withstand stressors, shocks, and volatility but also thrive and enhance performance in the presence of such adversarial events. Hence, modern transportation systems call for solutions that are antifragile. In this work, we propose a model-free deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) scheme to control a two-region urban traffic perimeter network. The system exploits the learning capability of RL under disruptions to achieve antifragility. By monitoring the change rate and curvature of the traffic state with the RL framework, the proposed algorithm anticipates imminent disruptions. An additional term is also integrated into the RL algorithm as redundancy to improve the performance under disruption scenarios. When compared to a state-of-the-art model predictive control approach and a state-of-the-art RL algorithm, our proposed method demonstrates two antifragility-related properties: (a) gradual performance improvement under disruptions of constant magnitude; and (b) increasingly superior performance under growing disruptions.</description>

      <title>Grid Monitoring with Synchro-Waveform and AI Foundation Model Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose:This article advocates for the development of a next-generation grid monitoring and control system designed for future grids dominated by inverter-based resources. Leveraging recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and networking technology, we develop a physics-based AI foundation model with high-resolution synchro-waveform measurement technology to enhance grid resilience and reduce economic losses from outages.
  Methods and Results:The proposed framework adopts the AI Foundation Model paradigm, where a generative and pre-trained (GPT) foundation model extracts physical features from power system measurements, enabling adaptation to a wide range of grid operation tasks. Replacing the large language models used in popular AI foundation models, this approach is based on the Wiener-Kallianpur-Rosenblatt innovation model for power system time series, trained to capture the physical laws of power flows and sinusoidal characteristics of grid measurements. The pre-trained foundation model causally extracts sufficient statistics from grid measurement time series for various downstream applications, including anomaly detection, over-current protection, probabilistic forecasting, and data compression for streaming synchro-waveform data. Numerical simulations using field-collected data demonstrate significantly improved fault detection accuracy and detection speed.
  Conclusion:The future grid will be rich in inverter-based resources, making it highly dynamic, stochastic, and low inertia. This work underscores the limitations of existing Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition and Phasor-Measurement-Unit monitoring systems and advocates for AI-enabled monitoring and control with high-resolution synchro-waveform technology to provide accurate situational awareness, rapid response to faults, and robust network protection.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Neural Fog: Interpretable Learning for AC Optimal Power Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem is essential for power system operations, but its non-convex nature makes it challenging to solve. A widely used simplification is the linearized DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem, which can be solved to global optimality, but whose optimal solution is always infeasible in the original AC-OPF problem. Recently, neural networks (NN) have been introduced for solving the AC-OPF problem at significantly faster computation times. However, these methods necessitate extensive datasets, are difficult to train, and are often viewed as black boxes, leading to resistance from operators who prefer more transparent and interpretable solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning-based approach that merges simplicity and interpretability, providing a bridge between traditional approximation methods and black-box learning techniques. Our approach not only provides transparency for operators but also achieves competitive accuracy. Numerical results across various power networks demonstrate that our method provides accuracy comparable to, and often surpassing, that of neural networks, particularly when training datasets are limited.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges for Reliable RIS Deployment in Heterogeneous Multi-Operator Multi-Band Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced as arrays of nearly passive elements with software-tunable electromagnetic properties to dynamically manipulate the reflection/transmission of radio signals. Research works in this area are focused on two applications, namely {\it user-assist} RIS aiming at tuning the RIS to enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of target users, and the {\it malicious} RIS aiming for an attacker to degrade the QoS at victim receivers through generating {\it intended} destructive interference. While both user-assist and malicious RIS applications have been explored extensively, the impact of RIS deployments on imposing {\it unintended} interference on various wireless user-equipments (EUs) remains underexplored. This paper investigates the challenges of integrating RISs into multi-carrier, multi-user, and multi-operator networks. We discuss how RIS deployments intended to benefit specific users can negatively impact other users served at various carrier frequencies through different network operators. While not an ideal solution, we discuss how ultra-narrowband metasurfaces can be incorporated into the manufacturing of RISs to mitigate some challenges of RIS deployment in wireless networks. We also present a simulation scenario to illuminate some practical challenges associated with the deployment of RISs in shared public environments.</description>

      <title>SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We showcase the application of our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we model the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Observer-Parameterized Control Barrier Function with Adaptive Safety Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents a nonlinear disturbance observer-parameterized control barrier function (DOp-CBF) designed for a robust safety control system under external disturbances. This framework emphasizes that the safety bounds are relevant to the disturbances, acknowledging the critical impact of disturbances on system safety. This work incorporates a disturbance observer (DO) as an adaptive mechanism of the safety bounds design. Instead of considering the worst-case scenario, the safety bounds are dynamically adjusted using DO. The forward invariance of the proposed method regardless of the observer error is ensured, and the corresponding optimal control formulation is presented. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations of a cruise control problem under varying road grades. The influence of road grade on the safe distance between vehicles is analyzed and managed using a DO. The results demonstrate the advantages of this approach in maintaining safety and improving system performance under disturbances.</description>

      <title>Future Pathways for EVTOLs: A Design Optimization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of advanced urban air mobility, particularly electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, requires interdisciplinary approaches involving the future urban air mobility ecosystem. Operational cost efficiency, regulatory aspects, sustainability, and environmental compatibility must be incorporated directly into the preliminary design of aircraft and across operational and regulatory strategies. In this work, we present a novel multidisciplinary design optimization framework for the preliminary design of eVTOL aircraft. The framework optimizes conventional design elements of eVTOL aircraft over a generic mission and integrates a comprehensive operational cost model to directly capture economic incentives of the designed system through profit modeling for operators. We compare the optimized eVTOL system with various competing road, rail, and air transportation modes in terms of sustainability, cost, and travel time. We investigate four objective-specific eVTOL optimization designs in a broad scenario space, mapping regulatory, technical, and operational constraints to generate a representation of potential urban air mobility ecosystem conditions. The analysis of an optimized profit-maximizing eVTOL, cost-minimizing eVTOL, sustainability-maximizing eVTOL, and a combined figure of merit maximizing eVTOL design highlights significant trade-offs in the area of profitability, operational flexibility, and sustainability strategies. This underlines the importance of incorporating multiple operationally tangential disciplines into the design process.</description>

      <title>Online Fault Tolerance Strategy for Abrupt Reachability Constraint Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a system's constraints change abruptly, the system's reachability safety does no longer sustain. Thus, the system can reach a forbidden/dangerous value. Conventional remedy practically involves online controller redesign (OCR) to re-establish the reachability's compliance with the new constraints, which, however, is usually too slow. There is a need for an online strategy capable of managing runtime changes in reachability constraints. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a fast fault tolerance strategy to recover the system's reachability safety in runtime. Instead of redesigning the system's controller, we propose to change the system's reference state to modify the system's reachability to comply with the new constraints. We frame the reference state search as an optimization problem and employ the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method as well as the Interior Point Method (IPM) based Newton's method (as a fallback for the KKT method) for fast solution derivation. The optimization also allows more future fault tolerance. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms the conventional OCR method in terms of computational efficiency and success rate. Specifically, the results show that the proposed method finds a solution $10^{2}$ (with the IPM based Newton's method) $\sim 10^{4}$ (with the KKT method) times faster than the OCR method. Additionally, the improvement rate of the success rate of our method over the OCR method is $40.81\%$ without considering the deadline of run time. The success rate remains at $49.44\%$ for the proposed method, while it becomes $0\%$ for the OCR method when a deadline of $1.5 \; seconds$ is imposed.</description>

      <title>Linear Model of Aggregated Homogeneous Energy Storage Elements with Realizable Dispatch Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To optimize battery dispatch, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory and ensure dispatch is admissible (i.e., does not lead to unexpected SOC saturation). However, battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we consider a composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while ensuring admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.</description>

      <title>BOOST: Microgrid Sizing using Ordinal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy systems has highlighted the critical need for efficient sizing of renewable energy resources in microgrids. In particular, designing photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems to meet residential loads is challenging due to trade-offs between cost, reliability, and environmental impact. While previous studies have employed dynamic programming and heuristic techniques for microgrid sizing, these approaches often fail to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we propose BOOST, or Battery-solar Ordinal Optimization Sizing Technique, a novel framework for optimizing the sizing of PV and battery components in microgrids. Ordinal optimization enables computationally efficient evaluations of potential designs while preserving accuracy through robust ranking of solutions. To determine the optimal operation of the system at any given time, we introduce a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach, which achieves lower costs than the commonly used dynamic programming methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework identifies optimal designs that achieve a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) as low as 8.84 cents/kWh, underscoring its potential for cost-effective microgrid design. The implications of our work are significant: BOOST provides a scalable and accurate methodology for integrating renewable energy into residential microgrids, addressing economic and environmental goals simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Tube-based Robust Model Predictive Control for a Distributed Parameter System Modeled as a Polytopic LPV (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.05962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed parameter systems (DPS) are formulated as partial differential equations (PDE). Especially, under time-varying boundary conditions, PDE introduce force coupling. In the case of the flexible stacker crane (STC), nonlinear coupling is introduced. Accordingly, online trajectory planning and tracking can be addressed using a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). However, due to the high computational demands of a NMPC, this paper discusses a possibility of embedding nonlinearities inside a linear parameter varying (LPV) system and thus make a use of a numerically low-demanding linear MPC. The resulting mismatches are treated as parametric and additive uncertainties in the context of robust tube-based MPC (TMPC). For the proposed approach, most of the computations are carried out offline. Only a simple convex quadratic program (QP) is conducted online. Additionally a soft-constrained extension was briefly proposed. Simulation results are used to illustrate the good performance, closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed approach despite uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Covariance Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes Distributed Model Predictive Covariance Steering (DiMPCS) for multi-agent control under stochastic uncertainty. The scope of our approach is to blend covariance steering theory, distributed optimization and model predictive control (MPC) into a single framework that is safe, scalable and decentralized. Initially, we pose a problem formulation that uses the Wasserstein distance to steer the state distributions of a multi-agent system to desired targets, and probabilistic constraints to ensure safety. We then transform this problem into a finite-dimensional optimization one by utilizing a disturbance feedback policy parametrization for covariance steering and a tractable approximation of the safety constraints. To solve the latter problem, we derive a decentralized consensus-based algorithm using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. This method is then extended to a receding horizon form, which yields the proposed DiMPCS algorithm. Simulation experiments on a variety of multi-robot tasks with up to hundreds of robots demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMPCS. The superior scalability and performance of the proposed method is also highlighted through a comparison against related stochastic MPC approaches. Finally, hardware results on a multi-robot platform also verify the applicability of DiMPCS on real systems. A video with all results is available in https://youtu.be/tzWqOzuj2kQ.</description>

      <title>Almost Surely $\sqrt{T}$ Regret for Adaptive LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05537v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Linear-Quadratic Regulation (LQR) problem with unknown system parameters has been widely studied, but it has remained unclear whether $\tilde{ \mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, which is the best known dependence on time, can be achieved almost surely. In this paper, we propose an adaptive LQR controller with almost surely $\tilde{ \mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret upper bound. The controller features a circuit-breaking mechanism, which circumvents potential safety breach and guarantees the convergence of the system parameter estimate, but is shown to be triggered only finitely often and hence has negligible effect on the asymptotic performance of the controller. The proposed controller is also validated via simulation on Tennessee Eastman Process~(TEP), a commonly used industrial process example.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Zeroth-Order Dynamics with Projection Maps: Model-Free Feedback Optimization with Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a class of model-free feedback methods for solving generic constrained optimization problems where the specific mathematical forms of the objective and constraint functions are not available. The proposed methods, termed Projected Zeroth-Order (P-ZO) dynamics, incorporate projection maps into a class of continuous-time model-free dynamics that make use of periodic dithering for the purpose of gradient learning. In particular, the proposed P-ZO algorithms can be interpreted as new extremum-seeking algorithms that autonomously drive an unknown system toward a neighborhood of the set of solutions of an optimization problem using only output feedback, while systematically guaranteeing that the input trajectories remain in a feasible set for all times. In this way, the P-ZO algorithms can properly handle hard and asymptotical constraints in model-free optimization problems without using penalty terms or barrier functions. Moreover, the proposed dynamics have suitable robustness properties with respect to small bounded additive disturbances on the states and dynamics, a property that is fundamental for practical real-world implementations. Additional tracking results for time-varying and switching cost functions are also derived under stronger convexity and smoothness assumptions and using tools from hybrid dynamical systems. Numerical examples are presented throughout the paper to illustrate the above results.</description>

      <title>Model-Predictive Control with NUP Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normals with unknown variance (NUV) and, more generally, normals with unknown parameters (NUP) can represent many useful priors including L_p norms and other sparsifying priors, and they blend well with linear-Gaussian models and Gaussian message passing algorithms. In this paper, we elaborate on recently proposed NUP representations of half-space constraints, box constraints, and finite-level constraints. We then demonstrate the use of such NUP representations for exemplary applications in model predictive control with a variety of constraints on the input, the output, or the internal state of the controlled system. In such applications, the computations boil down to iterations of Kalman-type forward-backward recursions, with a complexity (per iteration) that is linear in the planning horizon. In consequence, this approach can handle long planning horizons, which distinguishes it from the prior art. For nonconvex constraints, this approach has no claim to optimality, but it is empirically very effective.</description>

      <title>A Modified da Vinci Surgical Instrument for OCE based Elasticity Estimation with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic procedures, e.g., precise movement of the surgical instruments, improved dexterity, and high-resolution visualization of the surgical field. However, mechanical tissue properties may provide additional information, e.g., on the location of lesions or vessels. While elastographic imaging has been proposed, it is not readily available as an online modality during robot-assisted surgery. We propose modifying a da~Vinci surgical instrument to realize optical coherence elastography (OCE) for quantitative elasticity estimation. The modified da~Vinci instrument is equipped with piezoelectric elements for shear wave excitation and we employ fast optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to track propagating wave fields, which are directly related to biomechanical tissue properties. All high-voltage components are mounted at the proximal end outside the patient. We demonstrate that external excitation at the instrument shaft can effectively stimulate shear waves, even when considering damping. Comparing conventional and deep learning-based signal processing, resulting in mean absolute errors of 19.27 kPa and 6.29 kPa, respectively. These results illustrate that precise quantitative elasticity estimates can be obtained. We also demonstrate quantitative elasticity estimation on ex-vivo tissue samples of heart, liver and stomach, and show that the measurements can be used to distinguish soft and stiff tissue types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for mobile robot navigation in dynamic, unknown environments, leveraging onboard sensing and distributionally robust optimization to impose probabilistic safety constraints. Our method introduces a distributionally robust control barrier function (DR-CBF) that directly integrates noisy sensor measurements and state estimates to define safety constraints. This approach is applicable to a wide range of control-affine dynamics, generalizable to robots with complex geometries, and capable of operating at real-time control frequencies. Coupled with a control Lyapunov function (CLF) for path following, the proposed CLF-DR-CBF control synthesis method achieves safe, robust, and efficient navigation in challenging environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach for safe autonomous navigation under uncertainty in simulations and real-world experiments with differential-drive robots.</description>

      <title>Quality Time: Carbon-Aware Quality Adaptation for Energy-Intensive Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy demand of modern cloud services, particularly those related to generative AI, is increasing at an unprecedented pace. While hyperscalers collectively fail to meet their self-imposed emission reduction targets, they face increasing pressure from environmental sustainability reporting across many jurisdictions. To date, carbon-aware computing strategies have primarily focused on batch process scheduling or geo-distributed load balancing. However, such approaches are not applicable to services that require constant availability at specific locations due to latency, privacy, data, or infrastructure constraints.
  In this paper, we explore how the carbon footprint of energy-intensive services can be reduced by adjusting the fraction of requests served by different service quality tiers. We show that adapting this quality of responses with respect to grid carbon intensity can lead to additional carbon savings beyond resource and energy efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a forecast-based multi-horizon optimization that reaches close-to-optimal carbon savings and is able to automatically adapt service quality for best-effort users to stay within an annual carbon budget. Our approach can reduce the emissions of large-scale LLM services, which we estimate at multiple 10,000 tons of CO2 annually, by up to 10%.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning-Based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of connected automated vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a potentially practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</description>

      <title>Sample-Based Piecewise Linear Power Flow Approximations Using Second-Order Sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent nonlinearity of the power flow equations poses significant challenges in accurately modeling power systems, particularly when employing linearized approximations. Although power flow linearizations provide computational efficiency, they can fail to fully capture nonlinear behavior across diverse operating conditions. To improve approximation accuracy, we propose conservative piecewise linear approximations (CPLA) of the power flow equations, which are designed to consistently over- or under-estimate the quantity of interest, ensuring conservative behavior in optimization. The flexibility provided by piecewise linear functions can yield improved accuracy relative to standard linear approximations. However, applying CPLA across all dimensions of the power flow equations could introduce significant computational complexity, especially for large-scale optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a strategy that selectively targets dimensions exhibiting significant nonlinearities. Using a second-order sensitivity analysis, we identify the directions where the power flow equations exhibit the most significant curvature and tailor the CPLAs to improve accuracy in these specific directions. This approach reduces the computational burden while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly well-suited for mixed-integer programming problems involving the power flow equations.</description>
