      <title>On discretely structured logistic models and their moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logistic equation is ubiquitous in applied mathematics as a minimal model of saturating growth. Here, we examine a generalisation of the logistic model to fitness-structured populations, motivated by examples that range from the ageing of individuals in a species to immune cell exhaustion by cancerous tissue. Through exploration of a range of concrete examples and a general analysis of polynomial fitness functions, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the dependence of the kinetics on structure to result in closed, low-dimensional moment equations that are exact. Further, we showcase how coarse-grained moment information can be used to elucidate the details of structured dynamics, with immediate potential for model selection and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of dominant microflora isolated from selected ripened cheese varieties produced in Uganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were obtained from Gouda, Jack, Cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses produced in Uganda. The isolates were identified through Gram staining, catalase and oxidase tests, and 16S rDNA sequencing. Approximately 90% of the isolates were cocci (n=192), including Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus. The remaining 10% were identified as rod-shaped bacteria, primarily belonging to the Lactobacillus species (n=23). BLAST analysis revealed that Pediococcus pentosaceus dominated in all cheese samples (23.7%, of the total 114 isolates). This was followed by uncultured bacterium (15.8%), uncultured Pediococcus species (13.2%), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (8.8%) among others</description>

      <title>Estimating the population-level effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions when transmission rates of COVID-19 vary by orders of magnitude from one contact to another</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical physicists have long studied systems where the variable of interest spans many orders of magnitude, the classic example is the relaxation times of glassy materials, which are often found to follow power laws. A power-law dependence has been found for the probability of transmission of COVID-19, as a function of length of time a susceptible person is in contact with an infected person. This is in data from the United Kingdom's COVID-19 app. The amount of virus in infected people spans many orders of magnitude. Inspired by this I assume that the power-law behaviour found in COVID-19 transmission, is due to the effective transmission rate varying over orders of magnitude from one contact to another. I then use a model from statistical physics to estimate that if a population all wear FFP2/N95 masks, this reduces the effective reproduction number for COVID-19 transmission by a factor of approximately nine.</description>

      <title>Length of the longest branches in a Bellman--Harris tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a Bellman--Harris-type branching process, in which individuals evolve independently of one another, giving birth after a random time $T$ to a random number $L$ of children. In this article, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the length of the longest branches of this branching process at time $t$, both pendant branches (corresponding to individuals still alive at time $t$) and interior branches (corresponding to individuals dead before time $t$).</description>

      <title>When is local search both effective and efficient?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems define fitness landscapes that combine the numerics of the 'fitness' function to be maximized with the combinatorics of which assignments are adjacent. Local search starts at an initial assignment in this landscape and successively moves to assignments until no further improvement is possible among the adjacent assignments. Classic analyses of local search algorithms have focused mostly on the question of effectiveness ("did the algorithm find a good solution?") and often implicitly assumed that there are no doubts about their efficiency ("did the algorithm find the solution quickly?"). But there are many reasons to doubt the efficiency of local search. Many local search algorithms are known to be inefficient even if we focus on fitness landscapes on the hypercube that are single peaked on every subcube (known as semismooth fitness landscapes, completely unimodal pseudo-Boolean functions, or acyclic unique sink orientations). Here, we want to identify the most expressive subclass of single-peaked binary Boolean valued constraint satisfaction problems for which many popular local search algorithms are efficient. In this paper, we introduce the class of conditionally-smooth fitness landscapes where the preferred assignment of a variable xj depends only on the assignments of variables xi with i less than j in an associated partial order. We prove that many popular local search algorithms like random ascent, simulated annealing, various jumping rules, and the Kernighan-Lin heuristic are very efficient on conditionally-smooth landscapes. Some other popular local search algorithms like steepest ascent and random facet, however, still require a super-polynomial number of steps on these landscapes. Our hope is to contribute to a fuller understanding of what properties fitness landscapes must have for local search algorithms to be both effective and efficient.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian computation for Markovian binary trees in phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees describe the relationships between species in the evolutionary process, and provide information about the rates of diversification. To understand the mechanisms behind macroevolution, we consider a class of multitype branching processes called Markovian binary trees (MBTs). MBTs allow for trait-based variation in diversification rates, and provide a flexible and realistic probabilistic model for phylogenetic trees. We develop an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) scheme to infer the rates of MBT parameters by exploiting the information in the shapes of phylogenetic trees.We evaluate the accuracy of this inference method using simulation studies, and find that our method is able to detect variation in the diversification rates, with accuracy comparable to, and generally better than, likelihood-based methods. In an application to a real-life phylogeny of squamata, we reinforce conclusions drawn from earlier studies, in particular supporting the existence of ovi-/viviparity transitions in both directions. Our method demonstrates the potential for more complex models of evolution to be employed in phylogenetic inference, in conjunction with likelihood-free schemes.</description>

      <title>Saddle avoidance of noise-induced transitions in multiscale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10231v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multistable dynamical systems driven by weak Gaussian noise, transitions between competing states are often assumed to pass via a saddle on the separating basin boundary. By contrast, we show that timescale separation can cause saddle avoidance in non-gradient systems. Using toy models from neuroscience and ecology, we study cases where sample transitions deviate strongly from the instanton predicted by Freidlin-Wentzell theory, even for weak finite noise. We attribute this to a flat quasipotential and present an approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action to aptly predict transition paths.</description>
