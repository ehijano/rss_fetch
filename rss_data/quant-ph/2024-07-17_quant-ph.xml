      <title>Scalable Networking of Neutral-Atom Qubits: Nanofiber-Based Approach for Multiprocessor Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atoms are among the leading platforms toward realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). However, scaling up a single neutral-atom device beyond $\sim 10^4$ atoms to meet the demands of FTQC for practical applications remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, we clarify the criteria and technological requirements for further scaling based on multiple neutral atom quantum processing units (QPUs) connected through photonic networking links. Our quantitative analysis shows that nanofiber optical cavities have the potential as an efficient atom-photon interface to enable fast entanglement generation between atoms in distinct neutral-atom modules, allowing multiple neutral-atom QPUs to operate cooperatively without sacrificing computational speed. Using state-of-the-art millimeter-scale nanofiber cavities with the finesse of thousands, over a hundred atoms can be coupled to the cavity mode with an optical tweezer array, with expected single-atom cooperativity exceeding 100 for telecom-band transition of ytterbium atoms. This enables efficient time-multiplexed entanglement generation with a predicted Bell pair generation rate of 100 kHz while maintaining a small footprint for channel multiplexing. These proposals and results indicate a promising pathway for building large-scale multiprocessor fault-tolerant quantum computers using neutral atoms, nanofiber optical cavities, and fiber-optic networks.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional motion of an impurity under dynamic light-induced dipole forces in an atomic subwavelength array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range dipole-dipole interactions in subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters involve virtual photon exchange processes that impart forces on the emitters due to the imposed photon recoil. We perform a semi-classical analysis of the dynamics of an impurity allowed to freely move through a subwavelength array of atoms in different parameter regimes. We numerically solve the coupled set of equations between motional and spin degrees of freedom to elucidate the possible impurity trajectories realizable in this system. We find that the impurity can maintain quasi-stable orbits within the plaquette for long times. The regions through which these orbits pass are strongly dependent on the chosen atomic transition dipole moment. We further provide intuition for our findings based on a simplified model, where the lattice dynamics is adiabatically eliminated. As a final point of analysis, we also take the motional degrees of freedom of the lattice atoms into account, and study the polaron-like excitation induced in the kinetic state of the lattice by the impurity.</description>

      <title>Tight lower bound on the error exponent of classical-quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental quantity of interest in Shannon theory, classical or quantum, is the error exponent of a given channel $W$ and rate $R$: the constant $E(W,R)$ which governs the exponential decay of decoding error when using ever larger optimal codes of fixed rate $R$ to communicate over ever more (memoryless) instances of a given channel $W$. Nearly matching lower and upper bounds are well-known for classical channels. Here I show a lower bound on the error exponent of communication over arbitrary classical-quantum (CQ) channels which matches Dalai's sphere-packing upper bound [IEEE TIT 59, 8027 (2013)] for rates above a critical value, exactly analogous to the case of classical channels.
  Unlike the classical case, however, the argument does not proceed via a refined analysis of a suitable decoder, but instead by leveraging a bound by Hayashi on the error exponent of the cryptographic task of privacy amplification [CMP 333, 335 (2015)]. This bound is then related to the coding problem via tight entropic uncertainty relations and Gallager's method of constructing capacity-achieving parity-check codes for arbitrary channels. Along the way, I find a lower bound on the error exponent of the task of compression of classical information relative to quantum side information that matches the sphere-packing upper bound of Cheng et al. [IEEE TIT 67, 902 (2021)]. In turn, the polynomial prefactors to the sphere-packing bound found by Cheng et al. may be translated to the privacy amplification problem, sharpening a recent result by Li, Yao, and Hayashi [IEEE TIT 69, 1680 (2023)], at least for linear randomness extractors.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a quantum information perspective, verifying quantum coherence in a quantum experiment typically requires adjusting measurement settings or changing inputs. A paradigmatic example is that of a double-slit experiment, where observing the interference pattern on the screen in a series of experimental settings where one, the other, and both slits are open unambiguously proves quantum coherence. Here we show that this is not necessary by verifying quantum coherence in a network scenario without the need for inputs. We show that there exist probability distributions for joint outcomes of three parties in a triangular network with independent sources that cannot be replicated using classical resources. Furthermore, we generalize our results to $n$-party networks and show that the discrepancy between correlations in classical and quantum networks increases with the number of parties. To this end, we derive nonlinear inequalities that are satisfied by classical correlations and find quantum states that violate them.</description>

      <title>Time-symmetric correlations for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-time expectation values of sequential measurements of dichotomic observables are known to be time symmetric for closed quantum systems. Namely, if a system evolves unitarily between sequential measurements of dichotomic observables $\mathscr{O}_{A}$ followed by $\mathscr{O}_{B}$, then it necessarily follows that $\langle\mathscr{O}_{A}\,,\mathscr{O}_{B}\rangle=\langle\mathscr{O}_{B}\,,\mathscr{O}_{A}\rangle$, where $\langle\mathscr{O}_{A}\,,\mathscr{O}_{B}\rangle$ is the two-time expectation value corresponding to the product of the measurement outcomes of $\mathscr{O}_{A}$ followed by $\mathscr{O}_{B}$, and $\langle\mathscr{O}_{B}\,,\mathscr{O}_{A}\rangle$ is the two-time expectation value associated with the time reversal of the unitary dynamics, where a measurement of $\mathscr{O}_{B}$ precedes a measurement of $\mathscr{O}_{A}$. In this work, we show that a quantum Bayes' rule implies a time symmetry for two-time expectation values associated with open quantum systems, which evolve according to a general quantum channel between measurements. Such results are in contrast with the view that processes associated with open quantum systems -- which may lose information to their environment -- are not reversible in any operational sense. We give an example of such time-symmetric correlations for the amplitude-damping channel, and we propose an experimental protocol for the potential verification of the theoretical predictions associated with our results.</description>

      <title>Geometric additivity of modular commutator for multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent surge of research in many-body quantum entanglement has uncovered intriguing properties of quantum many-body systems. A prime example is the modular commutator, which can extract a topological invariant from a single wave function. Here, we unveil novel geometric properties of many-body entanglement via a modular commutator of two-dimensional gapped quantum many-body systems. We obtain the geometric additivity of a modular commutator, indicating that modular commutator for a multipartite system may be an integer multiple of the one for tripartite systems. Using our additivity formula, we also derive a curious identity for the modular commutators involving disconnected intervals in a certain class of conformal field theories. We further illustrate this geometric additivity for both bulk and edge subsystems using numerical calculations of the Haldane and $\pi$-flux models.</description>

      <title>Quantum bungee jumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a potential that is well-defined everywhere on the positive half-line, but diverges to $-\infty$ as $x\rightarrow 0^+$, may still be able to dynamically confine a particle to the (positive) half-line. We shall call this effect quantum bungee jumping: in the familiar quantum tunneling scenario one heading towards a wall is expected to bounce off it but instead passes through, while in the present scenario one jumping off a cliff is expected to fall but instead is pulled back. We discuss a particular example of a potential displaying this property, and study its energy eigenstates and spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Sound and Complete Equational Theory for 3-Qubit Toffoli-Hadamard Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sound and complete equational theory for 3-qubit quantum circuits over the Toffoli-Hadamard gate set $\{ X, CX, CCX, H \}$. That is, we introduce a collection of true equations among Toffoli-Hadamard circuits on three qubits that is sufficient to derive any other true equation between such circuits. To obtain this equational theory, we first consider circuits over the Toffoli-$K$ gate set $\{ X, CX, CCX, K \}$, where $K=H\otimes H$. The Toffoli-Hadamard and Toffoli-$K$ gate sets appear similar, but they are crucially different on exactly three qubits. Indeed, in this case, the former generates an infinite group of operators, while the latter generates the finite group of automorphisms of the well-known $E_8$ lattice. We take advantage of this fact, and of the theory of automorphism groups of lattices, to obtain a sound and complete collection of equations for Toffoli-$K$ circuits. We then extend this equational theory to one for Toffoli-Hadamard circuits by leveraging prior work of Li et al. on Toffoli-Hadamard operators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Estimation and the Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of a particle on a ring with a long solenoid through and show that due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect this system naturally makes up a physical implementation of the quantum phase estimation algorithm for a $U(1)$ unitary operator. The implementation of the full quantum phase estimation algorithm with a $U(N)$ unitary operator is realised through the non-abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The implementation allows for a more physically intuitive understanding of the algorithm. As an example we use the path integral formulation of the implemented quantum phase estimation algorithm to analyse the classical limit $\hbar\to0$.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Search Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution for Excited State Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems in excited states are attracting significant interest with the advent of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While ground states of small molecular systems are typically explored using hybrid variational algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the study of excited states has received much less attention, partly due to the absence of efficient algorithms. In this work, we introduce the {\em subspace search quantum imaginary time evolution} (SSQITE) method, which calculates excited states using quantum devices by integrating key elements of the subspace search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) and the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) method. The effectiveness of SSQITE is demonstrated through calculations of low-lying excited states of benchmark model systems, including $\text{H}_2$ and $\text{LiH}$ molecules. With its robustness in avoiding local minima, SSQITE shows promise for advancing quantum computations of excited states across a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Controlled-Z operation and beam-splitter transformation for generation of squeezed Fock states by measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of squeezed Fock states by the one or more photon subtraction from a two-mode entangled Gaussian state using a beam splitter and a controlled-Z operation is addressed. From two different perspectives, we analyzed two entanglement transformations in the protocol. We evaluated the energy costs and resource requirements of the analyzed schemes. Furthermore, we studied the impact of experimental imperfections on the non-Gaussian states generated by measuring the number of particles. We explored the effects of photon loss and imperfect detectors on the squeezed Fock state generation protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a natural, parameter-free, discrete-variable formulation of Feynman path integrals. We show that for discrete-variable quantum systems, Feynman path integrals take the form of walks on the graph whose weighted adjacency matrix is the Hamiltonian. By working out expressions for the partition function and transition amplitudes of discretized versions of continuous-variable quantum systems, and then taking the continuum limit, we explicitly recover Feynman's continuous-variable path integrals. We also discuss the implications of our result.</description>

Abstract: We describe the problems of quantum chemistry, the intuition behind classical heuristic methods used to solve them, a conjectured form of the classical complexity of quantum chemistry problems, and the subsequent opportunities for quantum advantage. This article is written for both quantum chemists and quantum information theorists. In particular, we attempt to summarize the domain of quantum chemistry problems as well as the chemical intuition that is applied to solve them within concrete statements (such as a classical heuristic cost conjecture and a classification of different avenues for quantum advantage) in the hope that this may stimulate future analysis.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Control via Multipath Interference for Thousandfold Phase Amplification in a Resonant Atom Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for enhancing the robustness of light-pulse atom interferometers against the pulse infidelities that typically limit their sensitivities. The technique uses quantum optimal control to favorably harness the multipath interference of the stray trajectories produced by imperfect atom-optics operations. We apply this method to a resonant atom interferometer and achieve thousand-fold phase amplification, representing a fifty-fold improvement over the performance observed without optimized control. Moreover, we find that spurious interference can arise from the interplay of spontaneous emission and many-pulse sequences and demonstrate optimization strategies to mitigate this effect. Given the ubiquity of spontaneous emission in quantum systems, these results may be valuable for improving the performance of a diverse array of quantum sensors. We anticipate our findings will significantly benefit the performance of matter-wave interferometers for a variety of applications, including dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unravel the Rodeo Algorithm to determine the eigenstates and eigenvalues spectrum for a general Hamiltonian considering arbitrary initial states. By presenting a novel methodology, we detail the original method and show how to define all properties without having prior knowledge regarding the eigenstates. To this end, we exploit Pennylane and Qiskit platforms resources to analyze scenarios where the Hamiltonians are described by the Zeeman model for one and two spins. We also introduce strategies and techniques to improve the algorithm's performance by adjusting its intrinsic parameters and reducing the fluctuations inherent to data distribution. First, we explore the dynamics of a single qubit on Xanadu simulators to set the parameters that optimize the method performance and select the best strategies to execute the algorithm. On the sequence, we extend the methodology for bipartite systems to discuss how the algorithm works when degeneracy and entanglement are taken into account. Finally, we compare the predictions with the results obtained on a real superconducting device provided by the IBM Q Experience program, establishing the conditions to increase the protocol efficiency for multi-qubit systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study the analogous objects for systems of Majorana fermions. A crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system in which the fundamental degrees of freedom are fermionic. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving fermionic Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Accurate Numerical Simulations of Open Quantum Systems Using Spectral Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence between qubits is a major bottleneck in quantum computations. Decoherence results from intrinsic quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as noise in the external fields that perform the measurement and preparation processes. With prescribed colored noise spectra for intrinsic and extrinsic noise, we present a numerical method, Quantum Accelerated Stochastic Propagator Evaluation (Q-ASPEN), to solve the time-dependent noise-averaged reduced density matrix in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Q-ASPEN is arbitrarily accurate and can be applied to provide estimates for the resources needed to error-correct quantum computations. We employ spectral tensor trains, which combine the advantages of tensor networks and pseudospectral methods, as a variational ansatz to the quantum relaxation problem and optimize the ansatz using methods typically used to train neural networks. The spectral tensor trains in Q-ASPEN make accurate calculations with tens of quantum levels feasible. We present benchmarks for Q-ASPEN on the spin-boson model in the presence of intrinsic noise and on a quantum chain of up to 32 sites in the presence of extrinsic noise. In our benchmark, the memory cost of Q-ASPEN scales linearly with the system size once the number of states is larger than the number of basis functions.</description>

      <title>Analytical Performance Estimations for Quantum Repeater Network Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeater chains will form the backbone of future quantum networks that distribute entanglement between network nodes. Therefore, it is important to understand the entanglement distribution performance of quantum repeater chains, especially their throughput and latency. By using Markov chains to model the stochastic dynamics in quantum repeater chains, we offer analytical estimations for long-run throughput and on-demand latency of continuous entanglement distribution. We first study single-link entanglement generation using general multiheralded protocols. We then model entanglement distribution with entanglement swapping over two links, using either a single- or a double-heralded entanglement generation protocol. We also demonstrate how the two-link results offer insights into the performance of general $2^k$-link nested repeater chains. Our results enrich the quantitative understanding of quantum repeater network performance, especially the dependence on system parameters. The analytical formulae themselves are valuable reference resources for the quantum networking community. They can serve as benchmarks for quantum network simulation validation or as examples of quantum network dynamics modeling using the Markov chain formalism.</description>

      <title>Superconducting surface trap chips for microwave-driven trapped ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave-driven trapped ion logic gates offer a promising avenue for advancing beyond laser-based logic operations. In future microwave-based operations, however, the joule heat produced by large microwave currents flowing through narrow microwave electrodes would potentially hinder improvements in gate speed and fidelity. Moreover, scalability, particularly in cryogenic trapped ion systems, is impeded by the excessive joule heat. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach: superconducting surface trap chips that integrate high-$Q$ microwave resonators with large current capacities. Utilizing sub-ampere microwave currents in superconducting Nb resonators, we generate substantial magnetic field gradients with significantly reduced losses compared to conventional metal chips. By harnessing the high $Q$ factors of superconducting resonators, we propose a power-efficient two-qubit gate scheme capable of achieving a sub-milliwatt external microwave input power at a gate Rabi frequency of 1 kHz.</description>

      <title>Cloud-based Semi-Quantum Money</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Wiesner introduced the concept of quantum money, where quantum states generated according to specific rules function as currency. These states circulate among users with quantum resources through quantum channels or face-to-face interactions. Quantum mechanics grants quantum money physical-level unforgeability but also makes minting, storing, and circulating it significantly challenging. Currently, quantum computers capable of minting and preserving quantum money have not yet emerged, and existing quantum channels are not stable enough to support the efficient transmission of quantum states for quantum money, limiting its practicality. Semi-quantum money schemes support fully classical transactions and complete classical banks, reducing dependence on quantum resources and enhancing feasibility. To further minimize the system's reliance on quantum resources, we propose a cloud-based semi-quantum money (CSQM) scheme. This scheme relies only on semi-honest third-party quantum clouds, while the rest of the system remains entirely classical. We also discuss estimating the computational power required by the quantum cloud for the scheme and conduct a security analysis.</description>

      <title>Teleportation of unknown qubit via Star type tripartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eylee Jung \textit{et.al}\cite{jung2008} had conjectured that $P_{max}=\frac{1}{2}$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the perfect two-party teleportation and consequently the Groverian measure of entanglement for the entanglement resource must be $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. It is also known that prototype $W$ state is not useful for standard teleportation. Agrawal and Pati\cite{pati2006} have successfully executed perfect (standard) teleportation with non-prototype $W$ state. Aligned with Pati's protocol\cite{pati2006} we have considered here $Star$ type tripartite states and have shown that perfect teleportation is suitable with such states. Moreover, we have taken the linear superposition of non-prototype $W$ state and its spin-flipped version and shown that it belongs to $Star$ class. Also, standard teleportation is possible with these states. It is observed that genuine tripartite entanglement is not necessary requirement for a state to be used as a channel for successful standard teleportation. We have also shown that these $Star$ class states are $P_{max}=\frac{1}{4}$ states and their Groverian entanglement is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, thus concluding that Jung conjecture is not a necessary condition.</description>

      <title>Improved Belief Propagation Decoding on Surface Codes with High Accuracy and Low Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for universal quantum computing, requiring highly accurate and low-latency decoding algorithms. Belief Propagation (BP) is notable for its linear time complexity and general applicability to quantum LDPC codes. However, BP performs poorly on highly degenerate codes without Order Statistic Decoding (OSD) post-processing, which significantly increases time complexity. We focus on improving BP's performance on surface codes. We first propose Momentum-BP and AdaGrad-BP, inspired by machine learning optimization techniques, to reduce the oscillation of message updating and break the symmetric trapping sets. We further propose EWAInit-BP, which adaptively updates initial probabilities and exhibits aggressive exploration capabilities. EWAInit-BP achieves the highest accuracy among BP improvements without OSD post-processing on planar surface code, toric code, and XZZX surface code, providing a 1~3 orders of magnitude improvement compared to traditional BP, and demonstrating the error correction capability even under parallel scheduling. Its theoretical O(1) time complexity and high accuracy make it a promising candidate for high-precision real-time decoders.</description>

      <title>Microscopic parametrizations for gate set tomography under coloured noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gate set tomography (GST) allows for a self-consistent characterization of noisy quantum information processors. The standard device-agnostic approach treats the QIPs as black boxes that are only constrained by the laws of physics, attaining full generality at a considerable resource cost: numerous circuits built from the gate set must be run in order to amplify each of the gate set parameters. In this work, we show that a microscopic parametrization of quantum gates under time-correlated noise on the driving phase, motivated by recent experiments with trapped-ion gates, reduces the required resources enabling a more efficient version of GST. By making use of the formalism of filter functions over the noise spectral densities, we discuss the minimal parametrizations of the gate set that include the effect of finite correlation times and non-Markovian quantum evolutions during the individual gates. We compare the estimated gate sets obtained by our method and the standard long-sequence GST, discussing their accuracies in terms of established metrics, as well as showcasing the advantages of the parametrized approach in terms of the sampling complexity for specific examples.</description>

      <title>Dissipationless topological quantum computation for Majorana objects in sparse-dense mixed encoding process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation based on Majorana objects is subject to a significant challenge because at least some of the two-qubit quantum gates rely on the fermion (either charge or spin) parity of the qubits. This dependency renders the quantum operations involving these gates probabilistic when attempting to advance quantum processes within the quantum circuit model. Such an approach leads to significant information loss whenever measurements yield the undesired fermion parity. To resolve the problem of wasting information, we devise topological operations that allow for the non-dissipative correction of information from undesired fermion parity to the desired one. We will use the sparse-dense mixed encoding process for the controlled-NOT gate as an example to explain how corrections can be implemented without affecting the quantum information carried by the computational qubits. This correction process can be applied {to} either the undesired input qubits or the fermion parity-dependent quantum gates, and it works for both Majorana-zero-mode-based and Majorana-edge-mode-based topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence, rooted in the superposition nature of quantum mechanics, is one core concept. Until now, the concept of coherence has also been generalized into projections and POVMs, and various coherence measures have been proposed. However, under the framework of quantum resource theory, interpretations of coherence and its various measures are usually grouped into the operational interpretation, where coherence measures correspond to the successful probability of discrimination tasks. Until now, it is still not clear which role quantum resources like coherence and entanglement play in states' evolutions and dynamical processes. In this work, by introducing the new concept, average quantum distance, we show that for time-independent Hamiltonians, it is quantum coherence that determines the evolution speed on average. Furthermore, for the single qubit system, we show that it is coherence that completely determines the system's evolution. Besides, for time-dependent Hamiltonians, we also give one upper bound for distance during one qubit's evolution. For general quantum systems, the relation between quantum coherence and quantum dynamics is also discussed. And as one byproduct, we examine the criterion for coherence measures about projections and propose one new condition called order preserving condition. One new coherence measure for projections is proposed. Compared with conditions for coherence about orthonormal basis, this new condition, order preserving, highlights the difference between orthogonal decompositions and orthonormal basis of Hilbert spaces and is satisfied by our new measure.</description>

      <title>Behavior of correlation functions in the dynamics of the Multiparticle Quantum Arnol'd Cat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-particle Arnol'd cat is a generalization of the Hamiltonian system, both classical and quantum, whose period evolution operator is the renown map that bears its name. It is obtained following the Joos-Zeh prescription for decoherence, by adding a number of scattering particles in the configuration space of the cat. Quantization follows swiftly, if the Hamiltonian approach, rather than the semiclassical, is adopted. I have studied this system in a series of previous works, focusing on the problem of quantum-classical correspondence. In this paper I test the dynamics of this system by two related yet different indicators: the time autocorrelation function of the canonical position and the out of time correlator of position and momentum.</description>

      <title>Improve Virational Quantum Eigensolver by Many-Body Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have been widely demonstrated in both experimental and theoretical contexts to have extensive applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. However, the exponential growth in the dimension of the Hilbert space results in the phenomenon of vanishing parameter gradients in the circuit as the number of qubits and circuit depth increase, known as the barren plateau phenomena. In recent years, research in non-equilibrium statistical physics has led to the discovery of the realization of many-body localization. As a type of floquet system, many-body localized floquet system has phase avoiding thermalization with an extensive parameter space coverage and have been experimentally demonstrated can produce time crystals. We applied this circuit to the variational quantum algorithms for the calculation of many-body ground states and studied the variance of gradient for parameter updates under this circuit. We found that this circuit structure can effectively avoid barren plateaus. We also analyzed the entropy growth, information scrambling, and optimizer dynamics of this circuit. Leveraging this characteristic, we designed a new type of variational ansatz, called the 'many-body localization ansatz'. We applied it to solve quantum many-body ground states and examined its circuit properties. Our numerical results show that our ansatz significantly improved the variational quantum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudorandom states (PRSs) are state ensembles that cannot be distinguished from Haar random states by any efficient quantum algorithm. However, the definition of PRSs has been limited to pure states and lacks robustness against noise. In this work, we introduce pseudorandom density matrices (PRDMs), ensembles of $n$-qubit states that are computationally indistinguishable from the generalized Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble, which is constructed from $(n+m)$-qubit Haar random states with $m$ qubits traced out. For a mixedness parameter $m=0$, PRDMs are equivalent to PRSs, whereas for $m=\omega(\log n)$, PRDMs are computationally indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. In contrast to PRSs, PRDMs with $m=\omega(\log n)$ are robust to unital noise channels and a recently introduced $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ attack. Further, we construct pseudomagic and pseudocoherent state ensembles, which possess near-maximal magic and coherence, but are computationally indistinguishable from states with zero magic and coherence. PRDMs can exhibit a pseudoresource gap of $\Theta(n)$ vs $0$, surpassing previously found gaps. We introduce noise-robust EFI pairs, which are state ensembles that are computationally indistinguishable yet statistically far, even when subject to noise. We show that testing entanglement, magic and coherence is not efficient. Further, we prove that black-box resource distillation requires a superpolynomial number of copies. We also establish lower bounds on the purity needed for efficient testing and black-box distillation. Finally, we introduce memoryless PRSs, a noise-robust notion of PRS which are indistinguishable to Haar random states for efficient algorithms without quantum memory. Our work provides a comprehensive framework of pseudorandomness for mixed states, which yields powerful quantum cryptographic primitives and fundamental bounds on quantum resource theories.</description>

      <title>The Slow Growth of Entanglement in Long-range Interacting Spins Chains due to Destructive Interference between quasi-Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence of effective light cones in long-range interacting quantum systems remains a significant and intriguing conundrum. In this paper, we theoretically reveal a mechanism in Heisenberg spin chains at low temperatures, wherein subsystems resist entanglement despite the onset of entangling effects in quench scenarios. This mechanism is attributed to destructive interference among quasi-particles outside an effective light cone. Furthermore, we establish a necessary condition for the occurrence of the destructive interference phenomenon. We demonstrate that for 1-D power-law decay interactions, specifically those following $|d_{ij}|^{-p}$, destructive interference occurs when $p&gt;2$. As shown through theoretical and numerical analysis, this destructive interference results in an unexpected acceleration of entanglement propagation when the interaction range is truncated. This prediction is proposed to be observable experimentally in chains of trapped ions as a direct manifestation of the destructive interference effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of single and entangled photons is crucial for photonic quantum information processing. Quantum dots (QDs) are promising sources capable of producing high-quality quantum light states on demand, although at a rate typically limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs. We achieve this by coupling individual QDs to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars characterized with mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and quality factor of 62, consequently enabling high Purcell enhancement across a bandwidth of 15 nm. We measure a multi-photon emission probability as low as 0.5 % from QDs within these cavities. In addition to providing a valuable platform for exploring light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, this work represents a significant stride towards developing QD-sources emitting at high repetition rates, underpinning their role in the future of quantum communication and computing.</description>

Abstract: Computations of chemical systems' equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium dynamics have been suspected of being a "killer app" for quantum computers. This review highlights the recent advancements of quantum algorithms tackling complex sampling tasks in the key areas of computational chemistry: ground state, thermal state properties, and quantum dynamics calculations. We review a broad range of quantum algorithms, from hybrid quantum-classical to fully quantum, focusing on the traditional Monte Carlo family, including Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational Monte Carlo, projector Monte Carlo, path integral Monte Carlo, etc. We also cover other relevant techniques involving complex sampling tasks, such as quantum-selected configuration interaction, minimally entangled typical thermal states, entanglement forging, and Monte Carlo-flavored Lindbladian dynamics. We provide a comprehensive overview of these algorithms' classical and quantum counterparts, detailing their theoretical frameworks and discussing the potentials and challenges in achieving quantum computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Computing with Formal Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial introduces quantum computing with a focus on the applicability of formal methods in this relatively new domain. We describe quantum circuits and convey an understanding of their inherent combinatorial nature and the exponential blow-up that makes them hard to analyze. Then, we show how weighted model counting (\#SAT) can be used to solve hard analysis tasks for quantum circuits.
  This tutorial is aimed at everyone in the formal methods community with an interest in quantum computing. Familiarity with quantum computing is not required, but basic linear algebra knowledge (particularly matrix multiplication and basis vectors) is a prerequisite. The goal of the tutorial is to inspire the community to advance the development of quantum computing with formal methods.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and operator correlation signatures of many-body quantum Zeno phases in inefficiently monitored noisy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between information-scrambling Hamiltonians and local continuous measurements hosts platforms for exotic measurement-induced phase transition in out-of-equilibrium steady states. Here, we consider such transitions under the addition of local random white noise and measurement inefficiency in a XX spin chain. We identify a non-monotonic dependence on the local noise strength in both the averaged entanglement and operator correlations, specifically the subsystem parity variance. While the non-monotonicity persists at any finite efficiency for the operator correlations, it disappears at finite inefficiency for the entanglement. The analysis of scaling with the system size in a finite length chain indicates that, at finite efficiency, this effect leads to distinct MiPTs for operator correlations and entanglement. Our result hints at a difference between area-law entanglement scaling and Zeno-localized phases for inefficient monitoring.</description>

      <title>Improved Quantum Power Method and Numerical Integration Using Quantum Singular Value Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) is a framework that has been shown to unify many primitives in quantum algorithms. In this work, we leverage the QSVT framework in two directions. We first show that the QSVT framework can accelerate one recently introduced quantum power method, which substantially improves its running time. Additionally, we incorporate several elementary numerical integration techniques, such as the rectangular method, Monte Carlo method, and quadrature method, into the QSVT framework, which results in polynomial speedup with respect to the size or the number of points of the grid. Our results thus provide further examples to demonstrate the potential of the QSVT and how it may enhance quantum algorithmic tasks.</description>

      <title>Operational quantification of simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of two-qubit states via one-sided semi-device-independent steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a weak form of quantum steering, i.e., certification of quantum steering in a one-sided semi-device-independent way, has been formulated [Jebarathinam et al. Phys. Rev. A 108, 042211 (2023)]. In this work, for two-qubit states, we study the relationships between the quantification of one-sided semi-device-independent steerability and information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases [Wu et al. Scientific Reports 4, 4036 (2014)]. For two-qubit states that belong to Bell-diagonal states, quantifying one-sided semi-device-independent steerability provides an operational characterization of information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases. For another class of two-qubit states, we show that quantifying one-sided semi-device-independent steerability provides operational quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases going beyond the above information-theoretic quantification. We invoke quantum steering ellipsoid formalism to shed intuitions on our operational characterization of simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of two-qubit states that we consider.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic on-chip microwave pulse generator for large-scale superconducting quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For superconducting quantum processors, microwave signals are delivered to each qubit from room-temperature electronics to the cryogenic environment through coaxial cables. Limited by the heat load of cabling and the massive cost of electronics, such an architecture is not viable for millions of qubits required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Monolithic integration of the control electronics and the qubits provides a promising solution, which, however, requires a coherent cryogenic microwave pulse generator that is compatible with superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we report such a signal source driven by digital-like signals, generating pulsed microwave emission with well-controlled phase, intensity, and frequency directly at millikelvin temperatures. We showcase high-fidelity readout of superconducting qubits with the microwave pulse generator. The device demonstrated here has a small footprint, negligible heat load, great flexibility to operate, and is fully compatible with today's superconducting quantum circuits, thus providing an enabling technology for large-scale superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Simple Fermionic backflow states via a systematically improvable tensor decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective ansatz for the wave function of correlated electrons that brings closer the fields of machine learning parameterizations and tensor rank decompositions. We consider a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization of a general backflow transformation in second quantization for a simple, compact and systematically improvable Fermionic state. This directly encodes $N$-body correlations without the ordering dependence of other tensor decompositions. We consider and explicitly demonstrate various controllable truncations, in the rank and range of the backflow correlations or magnitude of local energy contributions, in order to systematically affect scaling reductions to $\mathcal{O}[N^{3-4}]$. Benchmarking against small Fermi-Hubbard and chemical systems reveals an improvement over other NQS-like models, while extending towards larger strongly correlated ab initio systems demonstrates competitive accuracy with more established DMRG techniques on ab initio 2D hydrogenic lattices with realistic long-range Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dissipative Search via Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed quantum systems follow a unitary time evolution that can be simulated on quantum computers. By incorporating non-unitary effects via, e.g., measurements on ancilla qubits, these algorithms can be extended to open-system dynamics, such as Markovian processes described by the Lindblad master equation. In this paper, we analyze the convergence criteria and the convergence speed of a Markovian, purely dissipative quantum random walk on an unstructured search space. We analytically derive the mixing time for continuous- and discrete-time processes for different coupling regimes that control the random walk. Then, we map the results onto an actual implementation to correctly estimate the potential and show that it is no more efficient than classical search. Despite this, we highlight the connections between the classical random walks and open quantum random walks and demonstrate how to recover a quadratic speedup in the unitary limit. Moreover, the study of the Grover problem reveals how the hyperparameters affect the cost of implementation. This helps us refine the complexity analysis of the investigated algorithm to simulate the Lindblad equation.</description>

      <title>Uhlmann-quench, A Protocol to Measure the Uhlmann Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) following quantum quenches exhibit singular behavior of the overlap of the initial and evolved states. Here we present a formalism to incorporate a geometric phase into quench dynamics of mixed quantum states, a process named the Uhlmann quench, based on a mixed-state generalization of the Berry phase known as the Uhlmann phase. It has been shown that the geometric condition of the Uhlmann phase is incompatible with Hamiltonian dynamics, making its realization and measurement a challenging task. Nevertheless, we formulate the evolution of purification of the density matrix which not only respects the dynamics according to the density matrix but also incorporate the Uhlmann parallel-transport condition to generate a geometric phase following a quantum quench. For cyclic processes exemplified by a spin-1/2 system, geometric DQPTs can emerge with both singular behavior in the overlap and jumps of the geometric phase. Moreover, the Uhlmann phase is generated at the end of each cycle. The Uhlmann quench thus offers a route for investigating the interplay between quantum dynamics and geometric processes in mixed states.</description>

      <title>Approximate inverse measurement channel for shallow shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadows are a versatile tool to probe many-body quantum systems, consisting of a combination of randomised measurements and classical post-processing computations. In a recently introduced version of the protocol, the randomization step is performed via unitary circuits of variable depth $t$, defining the so-called shallow shadows. For sufficiently large $t$, this approach allows one to get around the use of non-local unitaries to probe global properties such as the fidelity with respect to a target state or the purity. Still, shallow shadows involve the inversion of a many-body map, the measurement channel, which requires non-trivial computations in the post-processing step, thus limiting its applicability when the number of qubits $N$ is large. In this work, we put forward a simple approximate post-processing scheme where the infinite-depth inverse channel is applied to the finite-depth classical shadows and study its performance for fidelity and purity estimation. The scheme allows for different circuit connectivity, as we illustrate for geometrically local circuits in one and two spatial dimensions and geometrically non-local circuits made of two-qubit gates. For the fidelity, we find that the resulting estimator coincides with a known linear cross-entropy, achieving an arbitrary small approximation error $\delta$ at depth $t=O(\log (N/\delta))$ (independent of the circuit connectivity). For the purity, we show that the estimator becomes accurate at a depth $O(N)$. In addition, at those depths, the variances of both the fidelity and purity estimators display the same scaling with $N$ as in the case of global random unitaries. We establish these bounds by analytic arguments and extensive numerical computations in several cases of interest. Our work extends the applicability of shallow shadows to large system sizes and general circuit connectivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealer accelerates the variational quantum eigensolver in a triple-hybrid algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical resources have become commonplace in quantum computing. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is routinely used to solve prototype problems. Currently, hybrid algorithms use no more than one kind of quantum computer connected to a classical computer. In this work, a novel triple-hybrid algorithm combines the effective use of a classical computer, a gate-based quantum computer, and a quantum annealer. The solution of a graph coloring problem found using a quantum annealer reduces the resources needed from a gate-based quantum computer to accelerate VQE by allowing simultaneous measurements within commuting groups of Pauli operators. We experimentally validate our algorithm by evaluating the ground state energy of H$_2$ using different IBM Q devices and the DWave Advantage system requiring only half the resources of standard VQE. Other larger problems we consider exhibit even more significant VQE acceleration. Several examples of algorithms are provided to further motivate a new field of multi-hybrid algorithms that leverage different kinds of quantum computers to gain performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos, Randomness and Universal Scaling of Entanglement in Various Krylov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a random matrix approach, combined with the ergodicity hypothesis, we derive an analytical expression for the time-averaged quantum Fisher information (QFI) that applies to all quantum chaotic systems governed by Dyson's ensembles. Our approach integrates concepts of randomness, multipartite entanglement and quantum chaos. Furthermore, the QFI proves to be highly dependent on the dimension of the Krylov space confining the chaotic dynamics: it ranges from $N^2/3$ for $N$ qubits in the permutation-symmetric subspace (e.g. for chaotic kicked top models with long-range interactions), to $N$ when the dynamics extend over the full Hilbert space with or without bit reversal symmetry or parity symmetry (e.g. in chaotic models with short-range Ising-like interactions). In the former case, the QFI reveals multipartite entanglement among $N/3$ qubits. Interestingly this result can be related to isotropic substructures in the Wigner distribution of chaotic states and demonstrates the efficacy of quantum chaos for Heisenberg-scaling quantum metrology. Finally, our general expression for the QFI agrees with that obtained for random states and, differently from out-of-time-order-correlators, it can also distinguish chaotic from integrable unstable spin dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parallel between commutative and non-commutative polymorphisms. Our emphasis is the applications to conditional distributions from stochastic processes. In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite kernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by quantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the form of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator valued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive operator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states) are indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the non-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory helps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication of our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between the two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.</description>

      <title>Atom Cavity Encoding for NP-Complete Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an atom-cavity system having long-range atomic interactions mediated by cavity modes. It has been shown that quantum simulations of spin models with this system can naturally be used to solve number partition problems. Here, we present encoding schemes for numerous NP-complete problems, encompassing the majority of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. We find a number of such computation problems can be encoded by the atom-cavity system at a linear cost of atom number. There are still certain problems that cannot be encoded by the atom-cavity as efficiently, such as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and the Hamiltonian cycle. For these problems, we provide encoding schemes with a quadratic or quartic cost in the atom number. We expect this work to provide important guidance to search for the practical quantum advantage of the atom-cavity system in solving NP-complete problems. Moreover, the encoding schemes we develop here may also be adopted in other optical systems for solving NP-complete problems, where a similar form of Mattis-type spin glass Hamiltonian as in the atom-cavity system can be implemented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the collective photon emission from atomic clouds both the atomic transition frequency and the decay rate are modified compared to a single isolated atom, leading to the effects of superradiance and subradiance. In this Letter, we analyse the properties of the Euclidean random matrix associated to the radiative dynamics of a cold atomic cloud, previously investigated in the contexts of photon localization and Dicke super- and subradiance. We present evidence of a new type of phase transition, surprisingly controlled by the cooperativeness parameter, rather than the spatial density or the diagonal disorder. The numerical results corroborate the occurrence of such a phase transition at a critical value of the cooperativeness parameter, above which the lower edge of the spectrum vanishes exhibiting a macroscopic accumulation of eigenvalues. Independent evaluations based on the two phenomena provide the same value of the critical cooperativeness parameter.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained dynamics in quantum many-body systems using the maximum entropy principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a coarse-grained map of a quantum many-body system, we construct the inverse map that assigns a microscopic state to a coarse-grained state based on the maximum entropy principle. Assuming unitary evolution in the microscopic system, we examine the resulting dynamics in the coarse-grained system using the assignment map. We investigate both a two-qubit system, with swap and controlled-not gates, and $n$-qubit systems, configured either in an Ising spin chain or with all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as non-linearity and non-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse-graining on quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Far from Perfect: Quantum Error Correction with (Hyperinvariant) Evenbly Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of qubit codes that we call Evenbly codes, building on a previous proposal of hyperinvariant tensor networks. Its tensor network description consists of local, non-perfect tensors describing CSS codes interspersed with Hadamard gates, placed on a hyperbolic $\{p,q\}$ geometry with even $q\geq 4$, yielding an infinitely large class of subsystem codes. We construct an example for a $\{5,4\}$ manifold and describe strategies of logical gauge fixing that lead to different rates $k/n$ and distances $d$, which we calculate analytically, finding distances which range from $d=2$ to $d \sim n^{2/3}$ in the ungauged case. Investigating threshold performance under erasure, depolarizing, and pure Pauli noise channels, we find that the code exhibits a depolarizing noise threshold of about $19.1\%$ in the code-capacity model and $50\%$ for pure Pauli and erasure channels under suitable gauges. We also test a constant-rate version with $k/n = 0.125$, finding excellent error resilience (about $40\%$) under the erasure channel. Recovery rates for these and other settings are studied both under an optimal decoder as well as a more efficient but non-optimal greedy decoder. We also consider generalizations beyond the CSS tensor construction, compute error rates and thresholds for other hyperbolic geometries, and discuss the relationship to holographic bulk/boundary dualities. Our work indicates that Evenbly codes may show promise for practical quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency dependence of nonsequential double ionization of atoms in strong laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency dependence of (nonsequential) double ionization is studied in fully quantum mechanical calculations using a (1+1)-dimensional model atom. Other time-dependent effects such as the influence of the number of field cycles are also investigated. We present ionization yields and momentum distributions. The results are consistent with experimental and semi-classical data available in the literature, thus complementing them with a quantum mechanical description.</description>

      <title>Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States for Classical and Quantum Simulation of Gauge Theories at Finite Temperature and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature and density is a longstanding challenge in nuclear and high-energy physics that also has fundamental implications for condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the utility of minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) approaches to facilitate both classical and quantum computational studies of such systems. METTS techniques combine classical random sampling with imaginary time evolution, which can be performed on either a classical or a quantum computer, to estimate thermal averages of observables. We study the simplest model of a confining gauge theory, namely $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to spinless fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions, which can be directly mapped to a local quantum spin chain with two- and three-body interactions. We benchmark both a classical matrix-product-state implementation of METTS and a recently proposed adaptive variational approach to METTS that is a promising candidate for implementation on near-term quantum devices, focusing on the equation of state as well as on various measures of fermion confinement. Of particular importance is the choice of basis for obtaining new METTS samples, which impacts both the classical sampling complexity (a key factor in both classical and quantum simulation applications) and complexity of circuits used in the quantum computing approach. Our work sets the stage for future studies of strongly coupled gauge theories with both classical and quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Stable infinite-temperature eigenstates in SU(2)-symmetric nonintegrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonintegrable many-body quantum systems typically thermalize at long times through the mechanism of quantum chaos. However, some exceptional systems, such as those harboring quantum scars, break thermalization, serving as testbeds for foundational problems of quantum statistical physics. Here, we investigate a class of nonintegrable bond-staggered models that is endowed with a large number of zero-energy eigenstates and possesses a non-Abelian internal symmetry. We use character theory to give a lower bound on the zero-energy degeneracy, which matches exact diagonalization results, and is found to grow exponentially with the system size. We also show that few-magnon zero-energy states have an exact analytical description, allowing us to build a basis of low-entangled fixed-separation states, which is stable to most perturbations found in experiments. This remarkable dynamical stability of special states elucidates our understanding of nonequilibrium processes in non-Abelian chaotic quantum models.</description>

      <title>Quantum-tunnelling deep neural networks for sociophysical neuromorphic AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum tunnelling effect -- the transmission of particles through a high potential barrier -- was one of the most impressive achievements of quantum mechanics made in the 1920s. Responding to the contemporary challenges, I introduce a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture that processes information using the effect of quantum tunnelling. I demonstrate the ability of the quantum tunnelling DNN (QT-DNN) to recognise optical illusions like a human. Hardware implementation of QT-DNN is expected to result in an inexpensive and energy-efficient neuromorphic chip suitable for applications in autonomous vehicles. The optical illusions recognition tests developed in this paper should lay foundations for cognitive benchmarking tasks for AI systems of the future, benefiting the fields of sociophysics and behavioural science.</description>

      <title>Chaos and integrability in triangular billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize quantum dynamics in triangular billiards in terms of five properties: (1) the level spacing ratio (LSR), (2) spectral complexity (SC), (3) Lanczos coefficient variance, (4) energy eigenstate localisation in the Krylov basis, and (5) dynamical growth of spread complexity. The billiards we study are classified as integrable, pseudointegrable or non-integrable, depending on their internal angles which determine properties of classical trajectories and associated quantum spectral statistics. A consistent picture emerges when transitioning from integrable to non-integrable triangles: (1) LSRs increase; (2) spectral complexity growth slows down; (3) Lanczos coefficient variances decrease; (4) energy eigenstates delocalize in the Krylov basis; and (5) spread complexity increases, displaying a peak prior to a plateau instead of recurrences. Pseudo-integrable triangles deviate by a small amount in these charactertistics from non-integrable ones, which in turn approximate models from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). Isosceles pseudointegrable and non-integrable triangles have independent sectors that are symmetric and antisymmetric under a reflection symmetry. These sectors separately reproduce characteristics of the GOE, even though the combined system approximates characteristics expected from integrable theories with Poisson distributed spectra.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement scaling and area-law charge fluctuations in a non-Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu{=}1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic example of a non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter precisely different from a Fermi liquid? The entanglement entropy of the CFL state was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analogue [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu{=}1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional continuum system. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second R\'enyi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu{=}1/2$ but also at $\nu{=}1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu{=}1$ and $\nu{=}1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in the CFL state.</description>

      <title>Quantum Null Geometry and Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that quantizing gravity on a null hypersurface leads to the emergence of a CFT associated with each null ray. This result stems from the ultralocal nature of null physics and is derived through a canonical analysis of the Raychaudhuri equation, interpreted as a constraint generating null time reparametrizations. The CFT exhibits a non-zero central charge, providing a mechanism for the quantum emergence of time in gravitational systems and an associated choice of vacuum state. Our analysis reveals that the central charge quantifies the degrees of freedom along each null ray. Throughout our investigation, the area element of a cut plays a crucial role, necessitating its treatment as a quantum operator due to its dynamic nature in phase space or because of quantum backreaction. Furthermore, we show that the total central charge diverges in a perturbative analysis due to the infinite number of null generators. This divergence is resolved if there is a discrete spectrum for the area form operator. We introduce the concept of `embadons' to denote these localized geometric units of area, the fundamental building blocks of geometry at a mesoscopic quantum gravity scale.</description>

      <title>Spin entanglement in two-proton emission from $^6$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of coupled-spin entanglement in the two-proton ($2p$) radioactive emission. The three-body model of $^{6}$Be with the proton-proton interaction, which is adjusted to reproduce the experimental energy release, is utilized. Time-dependent calculation is performed to compute the coupled-spin state of the emitted two protons. The spin-correlation function $S$ as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) indicator is obtained as $\abs{S} \cong 2.72$. Namely, the $2p$-spin entanglement beyond the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory is concluded. This entanglement is sensitive to the proton-proton interaction. The short-lived (broad-width) $2p$~state has the weaker spin entanglement. In parallel, the core-proton interactions do not harm this entanglement during the time-dependent decaying process. The CHSH measurement can be a probe into the effective nuclear interaction inside finite systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases, and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as non-analyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Whereas the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Single-Photon Band Structure in a Coupled-Spinning-Resonator chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the single-photon band structure and the transport of a single photon in a one-dimensional coupled-spinning-resonator chain. The time-reversal symmetry of the resonators chain is broken by the spinning of the resonators, instead of external or synthetic magnetic field. Two nonreciprocal single-photon band gaps can be obtained in the coupled-spinning-resonator chain, whose width depends on the angular velocity of the spinning resonator. Based on the nonreciprocal band gaps, we can implement a single photon circulator at multiple frequency windows, and the direction of photon cycling is opposite for different band gaps. In addition, reciprocal single-photon band structures can also be realized in the coupled-spinning-resonator chain when all resonators rotate in the same direction with equal angular velocity. Our work open a new route to achieve, manipulate, and switch nonreciprocal or reciprocal single-photon band structures, and provides new opportunities to realize novel single-photon devices.</description>

      <title>DMRG study of the theta-dependent mass spectrum in the 2-flavor Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the massive $2$-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism using the density-matrix renormalization group(DMRG). The masses of the composite particles, the pion and sigma meson, are computed by two independent methods. One is the improved one-point-function scheme, where we measure the local meson operator coupled to the boundary state and extract the mass from its exponential decay. Since the $\theta$ term causes a nontrivial operator mixing, we unravel it by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to define the meson operator. The other is the dispersion-relation scheme, a heuristic approach specific to Hamiltonian formalism. We obtain the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states. The sign problem is circumvented in these methods, and their results agree with each other even for large $\theta$. We reveal that the $\theta$-dependence of the pion mass at $m/g=0.1$ is consistent with the prediction by the bosonized model. We also find that the mass of the sigma meson satisfies the semi-classical formula, $M_{\sigma}/M_{\pi}=\sqrt{3}$, for almost all region of $\theta$. While the sigma meson is a stable particle thanks to this relation, the eta meson is no longer protected by the $G$-parity and becomes unstable for $\theta\neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximum entropy inference and learning of graphical models are pivotal tasks in learning theory and optimization. This work extends algorithms for these problems, including generalized iterative scaling (GIS) and gradient descent (GD), to the quantum realm. While the generalization, known as quantum iterative scaling (QIS), is straightforward, the key challenge lies in the non-commutative nature of quantum problem instances, rendering the convergence rate analysis significantly more challenging than the classical case. Our principal technical contribution centers on a rigorous analysis of the convergence rates, involving the establishment of both lower and upper bounds on the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix for each iteration of these algorithms. Furthermore, we explore quasi-Newton methods to enhance the performance of QIS and GD. Specifically, we propose using Anderson mixing and the L-BFGS method for QIS and GD, respectively. These quasi-Newton techniques exhibit remarkable efficiency gains, resulting in orders of magnitude improvements in performance. As an application, our algorithms provide a viable approach to designing Hamiltonian learning algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The growth of quantum technologies is attracting the interest of many students eager to learn concepts such as quantum entanglement or quantum superposition. However, the non-intuitive nature of these concepts poses a challenge to understanding them. Here, we present an entangled photon system which can perform a Bell test, i.e. the CHSH inequality, and can obtain the complete tomography of the two-photon state. The proposed setup is versatile, cost-effective and allows for multiple classroom operating modes. We present two variants, both facilitating the measurement of Bell inequalities and quantum state tomography. Experimental results showcase successful manipulation of the quantum state of the photons, achieving high-fidelity entangled states and significant violations of Bell's inequalities. Our setup's simplicity and affordability enhances accessibility for less specialized laboratories, allowing students to familiarize themselves with quantum physics concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a species-independent method for improved loading into a single-atom optical tweezer array, utilizing iterative loading with multiple reservoir tweezers. Demonstrated with dual wavelength tweezer arrays of $^{88}$Sr atoms, our approach achieves a 96$\%$ loading rate after four reload cycles. This method can significantly enhance existing tweezer rearrangement protocols, potentially reducing iteration time and optical power consumption, thereby enabling a larger number of atoms in a quantum logic device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride is rapidly gaining interest as a platform for photonic quantum technologies, due to its two-dimensional nature and its ability to host defects deep within its large band gap that may act as room-temperature single-photon emitters. In this review paper we provide an overview of (1) the structure, properties, growth and transfer of hexagonal boron nitride; (2) the creation and assignment of colour centres in hexagonal boron nitride for applications in photonic quantum technologies; and (3) heterostructure devices for the electrical tuning and charge control of colour centres that form the basis for photonic quantum technology devices. The aim of this review is to provide readers a summary of progress in both defect engineering and device fabrication in hexagonal boron nitride based photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric Wigner construction for $D(G)$ and braided racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum double $D(G)=\Bbb C(G)\rtimes \Bbb C G$ of a finite group plays an important role in the Kitaev model for quantum computing, as well as in associated TQFT's, as a kind of Poincar\'e group. We interpret the known construction of its irreps, which are quasiparticles for the model, in a geometric manner strictly analogous to the Wigner construction for the usual Poincar\'e group of $\Bbb R^{1,3}$. Irreps are labelled by pairs $(C, \pi)$, where $C$ is a conjugacy class in the role of a mass-shell, and $\pi$ is a representation of the isotropy group $C_G$ in the role of spin. The geometric picture entails $D^\vee(G)\to \Bbb C(C_G)\blacktriangleright\!\!\!\!&lt; \Bbb C G$ as a quantum homogeneous bundle where the base is $G/C_G$, and $D^\vee(G)\to \Bbb C(G)$ as another homogeneous bundle where the base is the group algebra $\Bbb C G$ as noncommutative spacetime. Analysis of the latter leads to a duality whereby the differential calculus and solutions of the wave equation on $\Bbb C G$ are governed by irreps and conjugacy classes of $G$ respectively, while the same picture on $\Bbb C(G)$ is governed by the reversed data. Quasiparticles as irreps of $D(G)$ also turn out to classify irreducible bicovariant differential structures $\Omega^1_{C, \pi}$ on $D^\vee(G)$ and these in turn correspond to braided-Lie algebras $\mathcal{L}_{C, \pi}$ in the braided category of $G$-crossed modules, which we call `braided racks' and study. We show under mild assumptions that $U(\mathcal{L}_{C,\pi})$ quotients to a braided Hopf algebra $B_{C,\pi}$ related by transmutation to a coquasitriangular Hopf algebra $H_{C,\pi}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of a fiber piano in controlling spatial modes in few mode fibers. It has been found that together with sub-optimal coupling into SMF-28 fibre and half and quarter waveplates, the fiber piano is capable of producing and reproducing desired spatial modes up to $LP_{11}$ when using 808 nm light and up to $LP_{21}$ when using 632.8 nm light. The control of spatial mode profile extends down to the single photon level. This is demonstrated with the help of correlated photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work we showed that the detection of the exchange of a single graviton between a massive quantum resonator and a gravitational wave can be achieved. Key to this ability are the experimental progress in preparing and measuring massive resonators in the quantum regime, and the correlation with independent LIGO detections of gravitational waves that induce stimulated absorption. But do stimulated single-graviton processes imply the quantization of gravity? Here we analyze this question and make a historic analogy to the early days of quantum theory. We discuss in what ways such experiments can indeed probe key features of the quantized interaction between gravity and matter, and outline five experimental tests. This capability would open the first window into experimental exploration of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>

      <title>Dephasing and error dynamics affecting a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information transport over micron to millimeter scale distances is critical for the operation of practical quantum processors based on spin qubits. One method of achieving a long-range interaction is by coherent electron spin shuttling through an array of silicon quantum dots. In order to execute many shuttling operations with high fidelity, it is essential to understand the dynamics of qubit dephasing and relaxation during the shuttling process in order to mitigate them. However, errors arising after many repeated shuttles are not yet well documented. Here, we probe decay dynamics contributing to dephasing and relaxation of a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling over many $N$ repeated shuttle operations. We find that losses are dominated by magnetic dephasing for small $N&lt;10^3$ and by incoherent shuttle errors for large $N&gt;10^3$. Additionally, we estimate shuttle error rates below $1\times10^{-4}$ out to at least $N=10^3$, representing an encouraging figure for future implementations of spin shuttling to entangle distant qubits.</description>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulation of Hamiltonian evolution are often based on product formulae. The fractal method of Suzuki gives a systematic way to find arbitrarily high-order product formulae, but results in a large number of exponentials. On the other hand, product formulae with fewer exponentials can be found by numerical solution of simultaneous nonlinear equations. It is also possible to reduce the cost of long-time simulations by processing, where a kernel is repeated and a processor need only be applied at the beginning and end of the simulation. In this work, we found thousands of new product formulae of both 8th and 10th order, and numerically tested these formulae, together with many formulae from prior literature. We provide methods to fairly compare product formulae of different lengths and different orders. We have found a new 8th order processed product formula with exceptional performance, that outperforms all other tested product formulae for about eight orders of magnitude in system parameters $T$ (time) and $\epsilon$ (allowable error). That includes most reasonable combinations of parameters to be used in quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning has shown significant breakthroughs in quantum science, where in particular deep neural networks exhibited remarkable power in modeling quantum many-body systems. Here, we explore how the capacity of data-driven deep neural networks in learning the dynamics of physical observables is correlated with the scrambling of quantum information. We train a neural network to find a mapping from the parameters of a model to the evolution of observables in random quantum circuits for various regimes of quantum scrambling and test its \textit{generalization} and \textit{extrapolation} capabilities in applying it to unseen circuits. Our results show that a particular type of recurrent neural network is extremely powerful in generalizing its predictions within the system size and time window that it has been trained on for both, localized and scrambled regimes. These include regimes where classical learning approaches are known to fail in sampling from a representation of the full wave function. Moreover, the considered neural network succeeds in \textit{extrapolating} its predictions beyond the time window and system size that it has been trained on for models that show localization, but not in scrambled regimes.</description>

Abstract: With the growth of geometric science, including the methods of exploring the world of information by means of modern geometry, there has always been a mysterious and fascinating ambiguous link between geometric, topological and dynamical characteristics with quantum entanglement. Since geometry studies the interrelations between elements such as distance and curvature, it provides the information sciences with powerful structures that yield practically useful and understandable descriptions of integrable quantum systems. We explore here these structures in a physical system of $N$ interaction spin-$1/2$ under all-range Ising model. By performing the system dynamics, we determine the Fubini-Study metric defining the relevant quantum state space. Applying Gaussian curvature within the scope of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we proved that the dynamics happens on a closed two-dimensional manifold having both a dumbbell-shape structure and a spherical topology. The geometric and topological phases appearing during the system evolution processes are sufficiently discussed. Subsequently, we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem by achieving the time-optimal evolution. By restricting the whole system to a two spin-$1/2$ system, we investigate the relevant entanglement from two viewpoints; The first is of geometric nature and explores how the entanglement level affects derived geometric structures such as the Fubini-Study metric, the Gaussian curvature, and the geometric phase. The second is of dynamic nature and addresses the entanglement effect on the evolution speed and the related Fubini-Study distance. Further, depending on the degree of entanglement, we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem.</description>

      <title>Characterising transformations between quantum objects, 'completeness' of quantum properties, and transformations without a fixed causal order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many fundamental and key objects in quantum mechanics are linear mappings between particular affine/linear spaces. This structure includes basic quantum elements such as states, measurements, channels, instruments, non-signalling channels and channels with memory, and also higher-order operations such as superchannels, quantum combs, n-time processes, testers, and process matrices which may not respect a definite causal order. Deducing and characterising their structural properties in terms of linear and semidefinite constraints is not only of foundational relevance, but plays an important role in enabling the numerical optimisation over sets of quantum objects and allowing simpler connections between different concepts and objects. Here, we provide a general framework to deduce these properties in a direct and easy to use way. While primarily guided by practical quantum mechanical considerations, we also extend our analysis to mappings between general linear/affine spaces and derive their properties, opening the possibility for analysing sets which are not explicitly forbidden by quantum theory, but are still not much explored. Together, these results yield versatile and readily applicable tools for all tasks that require the characterisation of linear transformations, in quantum mechanics and beyond. As an application of our methods, we discuss how the existence of indefinite causality naturally emerges in higher-order quantum transformations and provide a simple strategy for the characterisation of mappings that have to preserve properties in a 'complete' sense, i.e., when acting non-trivially only on parts of an input space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a novel strategy to evaluate multi-variable integrals with quantum circuits. The procedure first encodes the integration variables into a parametric circuit. The obtained circuit is then derived with respect to the integration variables using the parameter shift rule technique. The observable representing the derivative is then used as the predictor of the target integrand function following a quantum machine learning approach. The integral is then estimated using the fundamental theorem of integral calculus by evaluating the original circuit. Embedding data according to a reuploading strategy, multi-dimensional variables can be easily encoded into the circuit's gates and then individually taken as targets while deriving the circuit. These techniques can be exploited to partially integrate a function or to quickly compute parametric integrands within the training hyperspace.</description>

Abstract: It is well established that the presence of single impurity can have a substantial impact on the transport properties of quantum many-body systems at low temperature. In this work, we investigate a close analog of this problem from the perspective of quantum information dynamics. We construct Brownian circuits and Clifford circuits consisting of a free fermion hopping term and a sole interaction. In both circuits, our findings reveal the emergence of operator scrambling. Notably, the growth of the operator can be mapped to the symmetric exclusion process in the presence of a source term localized at a single point. We demonstrate that in the one-dimensional system, both the operator and entanglement exhibit diffusive scaling. Conversely, in scenarios characterized by all-to-all hopping, the operator's size undergoes exponential growth, while the entanglement exhibits a linear increase over time.</description>

      <title>Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An accurate analytic formula for the partition function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work an approximate analytic expression for the quantum partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$ is presented. Using a path integral formalism, the exact partition function is approximated by the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with an effective frequency depending both on the temperature and coupling constant $g$. By invoking a Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) of the path integral to the effective frequency, we derive a mathematically well-defined analytic formula for the partition function. Quite remarkably, the formula reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the key features of the exact partition function. The free energy is accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical (high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. The divergence of the power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate coefficients. Explicit accurate expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies, $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$ are also presented.</description>

Abstract: The advent of near-term digital quantum computers could offer us an exciting opportunity to investigate quantum many-body phenomena beyond that of classical computing. To make the best use of the hardware available, it is paramount that we have methods that accurately simulate Hamiltonian dynamics for limited circuit depths. In this paper, we propose a method to classically optimise unitary brickwall circuits to approximate quantum time evolution operators. Our method is scalable in system size through the use of tensor networks. We demonstrate that, for various three-body Hamiltonians, our approach produces quantum circuits that can outperform Trotterization in both their accuracy and the quantum circuit depth needed to implement the dynamics, with the exact details being dependent on the Hamiltonian. We also explain how to choose an optimal time step that minimises the combined errors of the quantum device and the brickwall circuit approximation.</description>

Abstract: Permitting the transmission of unknown quantum states over long distances by using entanglement, quantum teleportation serves as an important building block for many quantum technologies. However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, the practical realization of quantum teleportation is inevitably challenged by the noise-induced decoherence. We here propose a noise-mitigation mechanism applicable in both the discrete- and continuous-variable quantum teleportation schemes. Via investigating the non-Markovian decoherence dynamics of the two types of quantum teleportation schemes, we find that, as long as a bound state is formed in the energy spectrum of the total system consisting of the involved subsystems and their respective reservoirs, the quantum superiority of the fidelity is persistently recovered. Supplying an insightful understanding of the noise-mitigation protocols, our result paves the way to the practical realization of noise-tolerant quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Decay-protected superconducting qubit with fast control enabled by integrated on-chip filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving fast gates and long coherence times for superconducting qubits presents challenges, typically requiring either a stronger coupling of the drive line or an excessively strong microwave signal to the qubit. To address this, we introduce on-chip filters of the qubit drive exhibiting a stopband at the qubit frequency, thus enabling long coherence times and strong coupling at the subharmonic frequency, facilitating fast single-qubit gates, and reduced thermal load. The filters exhibit an extrinsic relaxation time of a few seconds while enabling sub-10-ns gates with subharmonic control. Here we show up to 200-fold improvement in the measured relaxation time at the stopband. Furthermore, we implement subharmonic driving of Rabi oscillations with a $\pi$ pulse duration of 12 ns. Our demonstration of on-chip filters and efficient subharmonic driving in a two-dimensional quantum processor paves the way for a scalable qubit architecture with reduced thermal load and noise from the control line.</description>

      <title>Universal neural network potentials as descriptors: Towards scalable chemical property prediction using quantum and classical computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of diverse chemical properties is crucial for advancing molecular design and materials discovery. Here we present a versatile approach that uses the intermediate information of a universal neural network potential as a general-purpose descriptor for chemical property prediction. Our method is based on the insight that by training a sophisticated neural network architecture for universal force fields, it learns transferable representations of atomic environments. We show that transfer learning with graph neural network potentials such as M3GNet and MACE achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods for predicting the NMR chemical shifts of using quantum machine learning as well as a standard classical regression model, despite the compactness of its descriptors. In particular, the MACE descriptor demonstrates the highest accuracy to date on the ${^{13}}$C NMR chemical shift benchmarks for drug molecules. This work provides an efficient way to accurately predict properties, potentially accelerating the discovery of new molecules and materials.</description>

Abstract: Stabilizer states have been commonly utilized in quantum information, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit simulation due to their simple mathematical structure. In this work, we apply stabilizer states to tackle quantum many-body problems and introduce the concept of stabilizer ground states. We establish an equivalence formalism for identifying stabilizer ground states of general Pauli Hamiltonians. Moreover, we also develop an exact and linear-scaled algorithm to obtain stabilizer ground states of 1D local Hamiltonians and thus free from discrete optimization. This proposed equivalence formalism and linear-scaled algorithm are not only applicable to finite-size systems, but also adaptable to infinite periodic systems. The scalability and efficiency of the algorithms are numerically benchmarked on different Hamiltonians. Finally, we demonstrate that stabilizer ground states are promising tools for not only qualitative understanding of quantum systems, but also cornerstones of more advanced quantum state ansatzes on both classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Qu8its for Quantum Simulations of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: The quantum Langevin equation as obtained from the independent-oscillator model describes a strong-coupling situation, devoid of the Born-Markov approximation that is employed in the context of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation. The question we address is what happens when we implement such 'Born-Markov'-like approximations at the level of the quantum Langevin equation for a harmonic oscillator which carries a noise term satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In this backdrop, we also comment on the rotating-wave approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness versus entanglement in matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between entanglement and non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) in matrix product states (MPSs). We study the relation between magic and the bond dimension used to approximate the ground state of a many-body system in two different contexts: full state of magic and mutual magic (the non-stabilizer analogue of mutual information, thus free of boundary effects) of spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg chains. Our results indicate that obtaining converged results for non-stabilizerness is typically considerably easier than entanglement. For full state magic at critical points and at sufficiently large volumes, we observe convergence with $1/\chi^2$, with $\chi$ being the MPS bond dimension. At small volumes, magic saturation is so quick that, within error bars, we cannot appreciate any finite-$\chi$ correction. Mutual magic also shows a fast convergence with bond dimension, whose specific functional form is however hindered by sampling errors. As a by-product of our study, we show how Pauli-Markov chains (originally formulated to evaluate magic) resets the state of the art in terms of computing mutual information for MPS. We illustrate this last fact by verifying the logarithmic increase of mutual information between connected partitions at critical points. By comparing mutual information and mutual magic, we observe that, for connected partitions, the latter is typically scaling much slower - if at all - with the partition size, while for disconnected partitions, both are constant in size.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Array Filtering of Resonance Fluorescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel frequency-filtering method for measuring and calculating frequency-filtered photon-correlations. This novel method is a cavity-based system we call the multi-mode array filter, which consists of an array of tunable single-mode cavities that are equally spaced in frequency. By introducing a mode-dependent phase modulation, we produce a near rectangular frequency response, allowing us to increase the filter bandwidth -- and thus the temporal response -- without sacrificing frequency isolation. We model the frequency filtering using a cascaded quantum open systems approach which completely neglects any back-action of the filter onto the source system. This allows us to derive a closed set of operator moment equations for source and filter system operators, thus providing an extremely efficient method to calculate frequency-filtered first- and second-order correlation functions. We demonstrate this novel filtering method by applying it to a resonantly driven two-level atom. We present examples of frequency-filtered power spectra to demonstrate the improved frequency isolation of the multi-mode array filter over the single-mode filter. We then present results for the single-mode and multi-mode-array filtered second-order auto- and cross-correlation functions. These are compared against expressions derived in the secular approximation. The improved frequency isolation of the multi-mode array filter allows us to investigate new regimes of frequency-filtered photon correlations, such as two-photon leapfrog processes, and the effect of vanishing bandwidth on filtered auto-correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: Rapid separation of linear crystals of trapped ions into different subsets is critical for realizing trapped ion quantum computing architectures where ions are rearranged in trap arrays to achieve all-to-all connectivity between qubits. We introduce a general theoretical framework that can be used to describe the separation of same-species and mixed-species crystals into smaller subsets. The framework relies on an efficient description of the evolution of Gaussian motional states under quadratic Hamiltonians that only requires a special solution of the classical equations of motion of the ions to describe their quantum evolution under the influence of a time-dependent applied potential and the ions' mutual Coulomb repulsion. We provide time-dependent applied potentials suitable for separation of a mixed species three-ion crystal on timescales similar to that of free expansion driven by Coulomb repulsion, with all modes along the crystal axis starting and ending close to their ground states. Three separately-confined mixed species ions can be combined into a crystal held in a single well without energy gain by time-reversal of this separation process.</description>

Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory.We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg Inequality for Dynamics of a Bose-Einstein Condensate in a Double-Well Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as postulated by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impracticality of noninvasive measurements. In this work, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

Abstract: Methods to find the solution state for optimization problems encoded into Ising Hamiltonians are a very active area of current research. In this work we compare the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with multi-stage quantum walks (MSQW). Both can be used as variational quantum algorithms, where the control parameters are optimized classically. A fair comparison requires both quantum and classical resources to be assessed. Alternatively, parameters can be chosen heuristically, as we do in this work, providing a simpler setting for comparisons. Using both numerical and analytical methods, we obtain evidence that MSQW outperforms QAOA, using equivalent resources. We also show numerically for random spin glass ground state problems that MSQW performs well even for few stages and heuristic parameters, with no classical optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.</description>

Abstract: Accessing the low-energy non-equilibrium dynamics of materials and their polaritons with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution has been a bold frontier of electron microscopy in recent years. One of the main challenges lies in the ability to retrieve extremely weak signals while simultaneously disentangling amplitude and phase information. Here, we present Free-Electron Ramsey Imaging (FERI), a microscopy approach based on light-induced electron modulation that enables coherent amplification of optical near-fields in electron imaging. We provide simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved measurements of a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane visualizing the sub-cycle dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein. The phase-resolved measurements reveals vortex-anti-vortex singularities on the polariton wavefronts, together with an intriguing phenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking the amplitude profile of a standing wave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent amplification of the near-field signal compared to conventional electron near-field imaging, resolving peak field intensities in the order of ~W/cm2, corresponding to field amplitudes of a few kV/m. As a result, our work paves the way for spatio-temporal electron microscopy of biological specimens and quantum materials, exciting yet delicate samples that are currently difficult to investigate.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two delta-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio 3:1 in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a delta-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in the Cognitive Domain: Alzheimer's Disease Study</title>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative brain disorder, which results in significant cognitive impairments, especially in the elderly population. Cognitive impairments can manifest as a decline in various mental faculties, such as concentration, memory, and other higher-order cognitive abilities. These deficits can significantly impact an individual's capacity to comprehend information, acquire new knowledge, and communicate effectively. One of the affected activities due to cognitive impairments is handwriting. By analyzing different aspects of handwriting, including pressure, velocity, and spatial organization, researchers can detect subtle alterations that might indicate early-stage cognitive impairments, especially AD. Recently, several classical artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been proposed for detecting AD in elderly individuals through handwriting analysis. However, advanced AI methods require more computational power as the size of the data increases. Additionally, diagnoses can be influenced by factors such as limited relevant classical vector space and correlations between features. Recent studies have shown that using quantum computing technologies in healthcare can not only address these problems but also accelerate complex data analysis and process large datasets more efficiently. In this study, we introduced a variational quantum classifier with fewer circuit elements to facilitate the early diagnosis of AD in elderly individuals based on handwriting data. We employed ZZFeatureMap for encoding features. To classify AD, a parameterized quantum circuit consisting of repeated Ry and Rz rotation gates, as well as CY and CZ two-qubit entangling gates, was designed and implemented. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.75 in classifying AD.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we found that AFM coupling appears at the YIG/Py interface of the tetrahedral YIG surface formed with ion milling. The STEM measurements suggest that the interfacial AFM coupling is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange coupling mechanism, which is confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to be energetically favorable. Thus, the combined experimental and theoretical results reveal the critical role of interfacial atomic structure in determining the type magnetic coupling in a YIG/ferromagnet heterostructure, and prove that the interfacial structure can be experimentally tuned by surface ion-milling.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum nature of gravity using a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the Bose-Einstein condensate which results in the decoherence. We observe that the decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of non-Hermitian skin effect and extended states in one-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with staggered onsite modulations and nonreciprocal hopping up to the next-nearest-neighboring (NNN) sites. Due to the NNN nonreciprocity, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in the system under open boundary conditions (OBC) can be energy dependent, and there will be NHSE edges in the eigenenergy spectrum, which separates the eigenstates localized at the opposite ends of the lattice. We find that the interplay between the nonreciprocal hopping and onsite modulations can reverse the direction of the skin effect and modify the position of the NHSE edge. Moreover, by tuning the system parameters, some of the eigenstates under OBC will become fully extended with the corresponding eigenenergies being imaginary under both open and periodic boundary conditions. Thus, the extended states can coexist with the NHSH in the same system. The NHSE can even be completely dissolved with all the eigenstates being extended when the modulation is imaginary. Our work unveils the intricate interplay between onsite modulations and nonreciprocal hopping in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed tracking of qubit fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental fluctuations degrade the performance of solid-state qubits but can in principle be mitigated by real-time Hamiltonian estimation down to time scales set by the estimation efficiency. We implement a physics-informed and an adaptive Bayesian estimation strategy and apply them in real time to a semiconductor spin qubit. The physics-informed strategy propagates a probability distribution inside the quantum controller according to the Fokker-Planck equation, appropriate for describing the effects of nuclear spin diffusion in gallium-arsenide. Evaluating and narrowing the anticipated distribution by a predetermined qubit probe sequence enables improved dynamical tracking of the uncontrolled magnetic field gradient within the singlet-triplet qubit. The adaptive strategy replaces the probe sequence by a small number of qubit probe cycles, with each probe time conditioned on the previous measurement outcomes, thereby further increasing the estimation efficiency. The combined real-time estimation strategy efficiently tracks low-frequency nuclear spin fluctuations in solid-state qubits, and can be applied to other qubit platforms by tailoring the appropriate update equation to capture their distinct noise sources.</description>

      <title>Extending the Tavis-Cummings model for molecular ensembles -- Exploring the effects of dipole self energies and static dipole moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling of organic molecules to the vacuum field of a nanoscale cavity can be used to modify their chemical and physical properties. We extend the Tavis-Cummings model for molecular ensembles and show that the often neglected interaction terms arising from the static dipole moment and the dipole self-energy are essential for a correct description of the light-matter interaction in polaritonic chemistry. On the basis of a full quantum description, we simulate the excited-state dynamics and spectroscopy of MgH$^+$ molecules resonantly coupled to an optical cavity. We show that the inclusion of static dipole moments and the dipole self-energy is necessary to obtain a consistent model. We construct an efficient two-level system approach that reproduces the main features of the real molecular system and may be used to simulate larger molecular ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the effective Hamiltonian arising from the tight binding model, we study the behaviour of low-lying excitations for bilayer graphene placed in periodic external magnetic fields by using irreducible second order supersymmetry transformations. The coupled system of equations describing these excitations is reduced to a pair of periodic Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians intertwined by a second order differential operator. The direct implementation of more general second-order supersymmetry transformations allows to create nonsingular Schr\"odinger potentials with periodicity defects and bound states embedded in the forbidden bands, which turn out to be associated to quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices. Applications in quantum metamaterials stem from the ability to engineer and control such bound states which could lead to a fast development of the subject in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological and geometrical features arising in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems have mainly been studied by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. We propose how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Accelerated creation of NOON states with ultracold atoms via counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum control protocol is proposed for the creation of NOON states with $N$ ultracold bosonic atoms on two modes, corresponding to the coherent superposition $\vert N,0\rangle + \vert 0,N\rangle$. This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the two other modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical usefulness, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations originate from virtual excitation of Z bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To account for neutrino oscillations, it is postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, I find that the energy conservation law requires these mass eigenstates, if they exist, to be entangled with distinct joint energy eigenstates of the other particles produced by the same weak interaction as the neutrino. This entanglement destroys the quantum coherence among the neutrino's mass eigenstates, which is responsible for flavor oscillations under the aforementioned postulation. I reveal that the neutrino oscillations actually originate from virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Learning local equivariant representations for quantum operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for understanding material properties. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design, constructing local, equivariant representations for quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependence without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution technique, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</description>
