      <title>Push and Pull: Elastic Interaction Between Pressurized Spherical Cavities in Nonlinear Elastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic interaction of pressurized spherical cavities embedded in a three-dimensional hyperelastic medium is computationally analyzed. Using finite element analysis across several positive and negative pressure scenarios, we calculate the system's potential energy and configurational driving force for neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Arruda-Boyce material models. Our results show that while the interaction is always attractive for negative pressures, a non-monotonic energy landscape emerges for positive pressures above a critical value. In this regime, cavities attract at close range and repel when further apart. The critical separation distance for this transition is shown to be dependent on the material's strain-stiffening parameters. These findings are consolidated into phase diagrams, providing a clear map of interaction behaviors.</description>

      <title>Casimir Interaction between Polydisperse Colloids Trapped at a Fluid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of polydispersity on fluctuation-induced interactions between Janus colloidal particles trapped at a fluid interface. Using the scattering-matrix formalism, we calculate the thermal Casimir energy in both two- and three-body systems, considering three distinct fluctuation scenarios for the colloids: (a) fixed, (b) bobbing, and (c) bobbing and tilting. Our results reveal a pronounced sensitivity to polydispersity that strongly depends on the fluctuating boundary conditions: while fixed colloids show modest deviations, bobbing and especially bobbing+tilting configurations exhibit orders-of-magnitude amplification in the energy deviation due to polydispersity. These effects are further enhanced at large separations. Our findings highlights the interplay between geometry, colloids fluctuations, and fluctuation-induced forces, with implications for colloidal self-assembly and interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Constitutive modeling of viscoelastic solids at large strains based on the theory of evolving natural configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of evolving natural configurations is an effective technique to model dissipative processes. In this paper, we use this theory to revisit nonlinear constitutive models of viscoelastic solids. Particularly, a Maxwell and a Kelvin-Voigt model and their associated standard solids, viz., a Zener and a Poynting-Thompson solids respectively, have been modeled within a Lagrangian framework. We show that while a strain-space formulation of the evolving natural configurations is useful in modeling Maxwell-type materials, a stress-space formulation that incorporates a rate of dissipation function in terms of the relevant configurational forces is required for modeling the Kelvin-Voigt type materials. Furthermore, we also show that the basic Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt models can be obtained as limiting cases from the derived standard solid models. Integration algorithms for the proposed models have been developed and numerical solutions for a relevant boundary value problem are obtained. The response of the developed models have been compared and benchmarked with experimental data. Specifically, the response of the novel Poynting-Thompson model is studied in details. This model shows a very good match with the existing experimental data obtained from a uniaxial stretching of polymers over a large extent of strain. The relaxation behavior and rate effects for the developed models have been studied.</description>

      <title>Order-Disorder Transition in Delay Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions in active matter systems inherently involve delays due to information processing and actuation lags. We numerically investigate the impact of such delays on the phase behavior of the Vicsek model for motile active matter at a large but fixed system size. While the delayed Vicsek model retains the same three phases as the standard version -- an ordered state, a liquid-gas coexistence state, and a disordered state -- the presence of delay qualitatively alters the system's dynamics. At the relatively high velocity considered in this study, the critical noise for the transition between the ordered and coexistence states exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on delay, whereas the critical noise required for the transition to the disordered state increases with delay. Consequently, the width of the noise interval in which phase separation occurs broadens with increasing delay. Short delays stabilize the ordered phase, while long delays destabilize it in favor of the coexistence phase, which is consistently stabilized compared to the disordered state. Furthermore, the number of bands observed in the coexistence state at a given noise increases, and the time required for their formation decreases with delay. This acceleration is attributed to the emergence of swirling structures whose typical radius grows with increasing delay. Our results demonstrate that time delay in the Vicsek model acts as an effective control parameter for tuning the system's dynamic phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced stress-flow misalignment in soft glassy materials revealed using multi-directional shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the mechanical response of soft glassy materials, such as emulsions, foams, and colloidal suspensions, is key for many industrial processes. While their steady-state flow behavior is reasonably well understood, their response to complex flow histories, as encountered in operations like pumping or mixing, remains poorly known. Using a custom multi-axis shear apparatus that enables arbitrary changes in flow direction, we investigate how shear history influences the mechanical behavior of a model soft glassy system. We uncover a transient shear response orthogonal to the applied shear direction, together with an anisotropic yield surface. These effects point to an underlying anisotropic distribution of internal stresses imprinted by previous deformation. To rationalize this behavior, we use a mesoscopic elasto-plastic model, demonstrating that local mechanical disorder governs the emergence of macroscopic stress-flow misalignment. Our findings offer a new route to experimentally probe the distribution of local yield stresses in soft glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Heat and super-diffusive melting fronts in unsaturated porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When water is present in a medium with pore sizes in a range around 10nm the corresponding freezing point depression will cause long range broadening of a melting front. Describing the freezing-point depression by the Gibbs-Thomson equation and the pore size distribution by a power law, we derive a non-linear diffusion equation for the fraction of melted water. This equation yields super-diffusive spreading of the melting front with a diffusion exponent which is given by the spatial dimension and the exponent describing the pore size distribution. We derive this solution analytically from energy conservation in the limit where all the energy is consumed by the melting and explore the validity of this approximation numerically. Finally, we explore a geological application of the theory to the case of one-dimensional sub-surface melting fronts in granular or soil systems. These fronts, which are produced by heating of the surface, spread at a super-diffusive rate and affect the subsurface to significantly larger depths than would a system without the effects of freezing point depression.</description>

      <title>SERS Raman detection of the CO$_2$ Moisture Swing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of scalable, energy-efficient carbon dioxide capture technologies is critical for achieving net-zero emissions. Moisture swing sorbents offer a promising alternative to traditional thermal regeneration methods by enabling reversible CO$_2$ binding through humidity-driven ion hydrolysis. In this study, we investigate the anion speciation dynamics in two classes of MS materials, an anion-exchange resin with bicarbonate anion and activated carbon impregnated with potassium bicarbonate salt using both sorption measurements and in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Ni coated Ag nanowires were employed as SERS substrates to enhance signal intensity and enable the real-time detection of carbonate , bicarbonate , and hydroxide species under controlled humidity conditions in both air and nitrogen atmospheres. The results reveal humidity-dependent interconversion between anionic species, with significant spectral shifts confirming the reversible hydrolysis reactions that drive the MS mechanism. Under humid conditions, we observed the depletion of bicarbonate signals and a concurrent increase in carbonate species, consistent with moisture-induced desorption of CO$_2$. These findings not only validate the mechanistic models of humidity-driven anion exchange in moisture swing sorbents but also demonstrate the practical potential of SERS as an operando diagnostic tool for monitoring CO$_2$ capture media. The ability to resolve and quantify the reversible transformation of carbonate, bicarbonate, and hydroxide ions under realistic environmental conditions provides valuable insight for the rational design, performance optimization, and quality control of next-generation sorbent materials for direct air capture applications.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The out-of-equilibrium character of active systems is often twofold, arising from both the activity itself and from non-reciprocal couplings between constituents. A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from equilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the question whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects collective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal polar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can induce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions to these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called exceptional points. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate within the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided it is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity, the transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy production rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths corresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the increase and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of the polarization order parameter at the particle level. This correspondence is supported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the long-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the susceptibilities of the polarization fields.</description>

      <title>Active Solids: Topological Defect Self-Propulsion Without Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-propulsion of +1/2 topological defects is a hallmark of active nematic fluids, where the defects are advected by the flow field they themselves generate. In this paper we propose a minimal model for defect self-propulsion in a nematic active solid: a linear elastic medium with an embedded nematic texture that generates active stress and associated elastic strains. We show that such coupling gives rise to self-propelled +1/2 defects that move relative to the elastic medium by local remodeling of the nematic texture without advection. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the fluid case and can lead to unbinding of defect pairs and stabilization of +1 defects. Our findings might help explain how orientational order, of, for example, muscle fibers, is reconfigured during morphogenesis in solid-like tissues. The proposed mechanism may, for instance, control motility and merging of +1/2 defects, which play a crucial role in setting up the body axis during Hydra regeneration.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-giant number fluctuations and nematic order in microswimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant number fluctuations (GNFs), whereby the standard deviation $\Delta N$ in the local number of particles $\langle N \rangle$ grows faster than $\sqrt{\langle N \rangle}$, are a hallmark property of dry active matter systems with orientational order, such as a collection of granular particles on a vibrated plate. This contrasts with momentum-conserving ("wet") active matter systems, such as suspensions of swimming bacteria, where no theoretical prediction of GNFs exist, although numerous experimental observations of such enhanced fluctuations have been reported. In this Letter, we numerically confirm the emergence of super-Gaussian number fluctuations in a 3-dimensional suspension of pusher microswimmers undergoing a transition to collective motion. These fluctuations emerge sharply above the transition, but only for sufficiently large values of the bacterial persistence length $\ell_p = v_s / \lambda$, where $v_s$ is the bacterial swimming speed and $\lambda$ the tumbling rate. Crucially, these "pseudo-GNFs" differ from true GNFs, as they only occur on length scales shorter than the typical size $\xi$ of nematic patches in the collective motion state, which is in turn proportional to the single-swimmer persistence length $\ell_p$. Our results thus suggest that observations of enhanced density fluctuations in biological active matter systems actually represent transient effects that decay away beyond mesoscopic length scales, and raises the question to what extent "true" GNFs with universal properties can exist in the presence of fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Interaction energies in paranematic colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of colloidal particles embedded in a paranematic -- an isotropic phase of a nematogenic medium above the temperature of the nematic-to-isotropic transition. In this state, the nematic order is induced by the boundary conditions in a narrow band around each particle and it decays exponentially in the bulk.
  We develop rigorous asymptotics of the linearization of the appropriate variational model that allow us to describe weak far-field interactions between the colloidal particles in two dimensional paranematic suspensions. We demonstrate analytically that decay rates of solutions to the full nonlinear and linear problems are similar and verify numerically that the interactions between the particles in these problems have similar dependence on the distance between the particles. Finally, we perform Monte-Carlo simulations for a system of colloidal particles in a paranematic and describe the statistical properties of this system.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</description>
