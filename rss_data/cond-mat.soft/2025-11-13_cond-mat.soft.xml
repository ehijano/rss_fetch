      <title>Lyapunov exponents explain disorder-induced polarization and soliton teleportation in a mechanical Markov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a mapping between spatial disorder and temporal stochasticity, we develop a new framework using Lyapunov exponents to explain exotic wave localization and mobility phenomena in disordered one-dimensional (1D) mechanical systems that can be constructed via a spatial analog of a Markov process, which we call ``mechanical Markov systems.'' We show that disorder induces robust polarization of zero modes (ZMs) in these mechanical Markov systems, and this phenomenon is explained using Lyapunov exponents. Remarkably, these ZMs become mobile solitons in the nonlinear regime despite the disorder-controlled localization of all other modes, and display a set of new nonlinear dynamics features including reflectionless chirality-dependent teleportation, which can also be explained using Lyapunov exponents. Our results establish the Markov formalism as a powerful tool to explain and design localization and dynamics in disordered mechanical systems, opening opportunities for programmable metamaterials with novel linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>The mechanical latching memory of an adhesive tape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The storage and retrieval of mechanical imprints from past perturbations is a central theme in soft matter physics. Here we study this effect in the partial peeling of an ordinary adhesive tape, which leaves a line of strong adhesion at the stopping point. We show how this behavior can be used to mechanically store and retrieve the amplitudes of successive peeling cycles. This multiple-memory behavior resembles the well-known return-point memory found in many systems with hysteresis, but crucially the driving here is rectified: peeling is unidirectional, where each cycle begins and ends with the tape flat on the substrate. This condition means that the tape demonstrates a distinct principle for multiple memories. By considering another mechanism that was recently proposed, we establish ``latching'' as a generic principle for memories formed under rectified driving, with multiple physical realizations. We show separately that tape can be tuned to erase memories partially and also demonstrate the function of tape as a mechanical computing device that extracts features from input sequences and compares successive values.</description>

      <title>Material-Based Intelligence: Self-organizing, Autonomous and Adaptive Cognition Embodied in Physical Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of intelligent materials often draws parallels with the complex adaptive behaviors of biological organisms, where robust functionality stems from sophisticated hierarchical organization and emergent long-distance coordination among a myriad local components. Current synthetic materials, despite integrating advanced sensors and actuators, predominantly demonstrate only simple, pre-programmed stimulus-response functionalities, falling short of robustly autonomous intelligent behavior. These systems typically execute tasks determined by rigid design or external control, fundamentally lacking the intricate internal feedback loops, dynamic adaptation, self-generated learning, and genuine self-determination characteristic of biological agents. This perspective proposes a fundamentally different approach focusing on architectures where material-based intelligence is not pre-designed, but arises spontaneously from self-organization harnessing far-from-equilibrium dynamics. This work explores interdisciplinary concepts from material physics, chemistry, biology, and computation, identifying concrete pathways toward developing materials that not only react, but actively perceive, adapt, learn, self-correct, and potentially self-construct, moving beyond biomimicry to cultivate fully synthetic, self-evolving systems without external control. This framework outlines the fundamental requirements for, and constraints upon, future architectures where complex, goal-directed functionalities emerge synergistically from integrated local processes, distinguishing material-based intelligence from traditional hardware-software divisions. This demands that concepts of high-level goals and robust, replicable memory mechanisms are encoded and enacted through the material's inherent dynamics, inherently blurring the distinction between system output and process.</description>

      <title>Broadband Dielectric and THz Spectroscopy on Bio-Related Matter: Water, Amino Acids, Proteins, and Blood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we examine the relevance and proper interpretation of broadband-dielectric and THz-spectroscopy data for the investigation of various types of biological matter. We provide an overview of the rich variety of different dynamic processes that can be detected by these experimental methods. Several experimental examples are discussed in detail, helping to understand the information that can be drawn from such studies. This includes dielectric spectra, extending well into the GHz region, for pure water, which can be considered as a simple but highly important biological molecule. We also discuss results for a prototypical aqueous solution of a protein, belonging to one of the most important classes of biological macromolecules. Moreover, we examine broadband dielectric spectra on blood as an example of functional biological matter in organisms. To demonstrate the relevance of THz spectroscopy for the investigation of biological molecules, we finally treat such experiments applied to different amino acids.</description>

      <title>Analytical Analysis of the Conformational and Rheological Properties of Flexible Active Polar Linear Polymers under Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformational and rheological properties of active polar linear polymers (APLPs) under linear shear flow are studied analytically. We describe a discrete APLP as an inextensible flexible Gaussian bead-spring chain supplemented by active forces along the bonds. The linear, non-Hermitian equations of motion are solved by an eigenfunction expansion in terms of a biorthogonal basis set. The model reveals an intimate coupling between activity and shear flow, which implies activity-enhanced polymer conformational and rheological properties. Compared to a passive polymer, we find a significantly enhanced shrinkage transverse to the flow direction with increasing shear rate, with a power-law exponent $-4/3$, compared to the passive values of $-2/3$. This conformational change is tightly linked with a strongly amplified shear-thinning behavior, where the shear viscosity exhibits the same power law. The characteristic shear rate for the onset of these effects is determined by the activity. In the asymptotic limit of large activities, the shear-induced features become independent of activity and equal to those of passive polymers.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal dynamics of surfactant driven secondary invasion in Gaussian pore networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capillarity-dominated two-phase displacement in porous media often continues beyond the initial invasion-percolation (IP) breakthrough, as surfactants alter interfacial properties and reopen pathways once sealed by capillary forces. This study examines such secondary invasion, where adsorption-driven reductions in interfacial tension and contact-angle shifts lower entry thresholds in yet uninvaded throats, enabling further displacement at a fixed inlet pressure. To capture this process, we employ a time-dependent pore-network framework that couples IP with a reduced-order transport-adsorption module. Local fluxes are governed by Poiseuille flow, interfacial adsorption follows a Langmuir isotherm, and wettability evolution is modeled through a calibrated phenomenological relation. Heterogeneity is prescribed by Gaussian throat-size distributions whose variance controls structural disorder. The resulting invasion trajectories are sigmoidal, consistent with Gaussian cumulative statistics, indicating that surfactant mass-transfer kinetics and network variance primarily rescale invasion timescales while preserving the overall functional form. The framework thus connects interfacial conditioning to time-varying capillary thresholds and reveals how surfactant-mediated processes govern post-breakthrough dynamics in heterogeneous porous systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Permeability in Metastable Droplet Interfacial Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane pores are implicated in several critical functions, including cell fusion and the transport of signaling molecules for intercellular communication. However, these structural features are often difficult to probe directly. Droplet interfacial bilayers offer a synthetic platform to study such membrane properties. We develop a theory that links size-selective transport across a metastable membrane with its transient structural properties. The central quantity of our theory is a dynamic permeability that depends on the mechanism of pore growth, which controls the transient distribution of pore sizes in the membrane. We present a mechanical perspective to derive pore growth dynamics and the resulting size distribution for growth \textit{via} Ostwald ripening and discuss how these dynamics compare to other growth mechanisms such as coalescence and growth through surfactant desorption. We find scaling relations between the transported particle size, the pore growth rate, and the time for a given fraction of particles to cross the membrane, from which one may deduce the dominant mechanism of pore growth, as well as material properties and structural features of the membrane. Finally, we suggest experiments using droplet interfacial bilayers to validate our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Force-induced Elastic Softening and Conformational Transitions in a Polyampholyte Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and polyampholyte (PA) chains is vital for understanding their biological functions and designing functional materials. We investigate the force-extension behavior of a PA chain with distinct charge sequences using molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on the generalized random-phase approximation (GRPA). A diblock PA chain under extensional force undergoes a continuous coil-to-stretch transition at weak electrostatic coupling, which sharpens into a globule-coil-like transition at stronger coupling. The GRPA theory quantitatively captures these behaviors, including the sharp conformational transition and its dependence on electrostatic strength. Simulations reveal pronounced hysteresis during the force-extension and relaxation processes. Additionally, the elastic modulus exhibits four regimes: an initial plateau, stress stiffening, an exponential stress-softening behavior, and a stress stiffening regime. Using the theoretical model and structural input of the PA chain, we have demonstrated that the elastic modulus in the elastic softening regime decreases exponentially, $E\sim \exp(-\alpha_0 f/\Gamma_e)$, as a function of $f$, which aligns with the simulation results. The elastic response of the PA chain is further examined across different charge sequences, where both elastic softening and sharp transitions are absent at smaller block lengths. Finally, coarse-grained models of IDPs such as LAF-1 and DDX4 exhibit similar nonlinear elasticity, highlighting the universality of these mechanisms. Our results establish a fundamental link between electrostatic correlations, charge sequence, and nonlinear elasticity, bridging molecular interactions and macroscopic mechanics.</description>

      <title>Photo-Switchable Cross-Linking in Polymer Gels: Effects on Surface Creasing and Network Relaxation during Swelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer gels with photo-responsive cross-links enable tunable mechanics and surface morphologies, making them promising for adaptive materials. While prior work on coumarin cross-linked gels has focused on photo-mediated events in dilute solution, their network-level mechanical responses remain unclear. Here, we design PEG hydrogels with both permanent covalent and dynamic coumarin cross-links, allowing in situ modulation of cross-linking under wavelength specific UV light. Real-time FTIR and dynamic mechanical analysis show that post-cure 365 nm irradiation drives rapid dimerization, increasing storage modulus by up to 69\%, whereas cleavage of coumarin cross-links via 254 nm post-cure irradiation has a more limited effect due to attenuation in bulk samples. Surface imaging reveals that dynamic cross-linking governs swelling-induced crease formation and evolution. Together, these results establish design principles for hydrogels with programmable mechanics and adaptive surface topographies, advancing application in smart coatings, actuators, and responsive biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Alignment frustration-induced swarming lattice in the Vicsek-Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frustration parameter $\alpha$ into the Vicsek-Kuramoto model of self-propelled particles. While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha &lt; \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Global Population and Carrying Capacity in the Anthropocene: the Relative Growth Rate Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report provides insights into global population dynamics since the beginning of the Anthropocene, focusing on empirical data and minimizing a priori the impact of model assumptions. It explores the Relative Growth Rate concept, introduced recently to global population studies by Lehman et al. [PNAS 118, e2024150118 (2021)] and subsequently extended to its analytical counterpart [PLoS ONE 20, eo323165 (2025)]. The analysis reveals a general non-monotonic growth pattern in the Anthropocene, emphasizing the uniqueness of the Industrial Revolution era. For the first 290 years, the Doomsday critical scaling provides a superior description for population changes, with a singularity at 2026. This is followed by the crossover to an exceptional 'reversed criticality' patterm, which has held over the last six decades, to the present day. The analysis suggests that the evolution of the human Real Intelligence (RI) population during the Innovations-driven Industrial Revolution times - a period of rapidly increasing connectivity and complexity - can serve as a model counterpart for the puzzling dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) growth. The final conclusion is positive: the catastropic Doomsday singularity can be avoided due to the generic system constraints , both for RI and AI.</description>

      <title>Active bacterial pattern formation in evaporating droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria living on surfaces are often confined to droplets. When these droplets evaporate, the motion of the liquid-air interface and the associated internal capillary flow confine the bacteria. Here we study how \emph{E. coli} bacteria interact with this capillary confinement and agglomerate at the droplet's contact line. We identify three different types of bacterial pattern formation that depend on the bacterial activity and the environmental conditions imposed by the evaporating droplet. When the evaporation is fast, the bacteria are slow or the suspension is dilute, a uniform contact-line deposit forms. However, when the capillary confinement concentrates the bacteria at the contact line beyond a critical number density, localized collective motion spontaneously emerges. In that case, the bacteria induce a local stirring of the liquid that allows them to self-organize into periodic patterns and enables them to collectively escape from the contact line. At very high number densities, these periodic patterns get destabilized by bacterial turbulence in the bulk of the droplet resulting in the formation of mobile bacterial plumes at the contact line. Our results show how the subtle interplay between the bacteria and the capillary flow inside the droplet that surrounds them governs their dispersal.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis demonstrate that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model: it exhibits a memory capacity that grows linearly with connectivity, a persistent spectral gap separating stored patterns from noise, and significantly enlarged basins of attraction. These results show that geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure yield associative memories with markedly enhanced stability and retrieval performance.</description>
