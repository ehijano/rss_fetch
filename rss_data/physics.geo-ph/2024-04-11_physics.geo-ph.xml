      <title>A Frequency-Domain Beamforming Procedure for Extracting Rayleigh Wave Attenuation Coefficients and Small-Strain Damping Ratio from 2D Ambient Noise Array Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The small-strain damping ratio plays a crucial role in assessing the response of soil deposits to earthquake-induced ground motions and general dynamic loading. The damping ratio can theoretically be inverted for after extracting frequency-dependent Rayleigh wave attenuation coefficients from wavefields collected during surface wave testing. However, determining reliable estimates of in-situ attenuation coefficients is much more challenging than achieving robust phase velocity dispersion data, which are commonly measured using both active-source and ambient-wavefield surface wave methods. This paper introduces a new methodology for estimating frequency-dependent attenuation coefficients through the analysis of ambient noise wavefield data recorded by two-dimensional (2D) arrays of surface seismic sensors for the subsequent evaluation of the small-strain damping ratio. The approach relies on the application of an attenuation-specific wavefield conversion and frequency-domain beamforming. Numerical simulations are employed to verify the proposed approach and inform best practices for its application. Finally, the practical efficacy of the proposed approach is showcased through its application to field data collected at a deep, soft soil site in Logan, Utah, USA, where phase velocity and attenuation coefficients are extracted from surface wave data and then simultaneously inverted to develop deep shear wave velocity and damping ratio profiles.</description>

      <title>Microbial iron reduction under oxic conditions: implications for subsurface biogeochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron (Fe) reduction is one of Earth's most ancient microbial metabolisms, but after atmosphere-ocean oxygenation, this anaerobic process was relegated to niche anoxic environments below the water and soil surface. However, new technologies to monitor redox processes at the microscale relevant to microbial cells have recently revealed that the oxygen (O2) concentrations controlling the distribution of aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms are more heterogeneous than previously believed. To explore how O2 levels regulate microbial Fe reduction, we cultivated a facultative Fe-reducing bacterium using a cutting-edge microfluidic reactor integrated with transparent planar O2 sensors. Contrary to expectations, microbial growth induced Fe(III)-oxide (ferrihydrite) reduction under fully oxygenated conditions without forming O2-depleted microsites. Batch incubations highlighted the importance of the process at a larger scale, fundamentally changing our understanding of Fe cycling from the conceptualization of metal and nutrient mobility in the subsurface to our interpretation of Fe mineralogy in the rock record.</description>

      <title>StageOpt technical write-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document provides technical background for StageOpt. This tool helps to better understand fluid and proppant distribution between perforations and clusters within a fracturing stage. Limited entry technique is often used to achieve uniform fluid distribution between clusters. This, however, does not automatically guarantee uniform proppant distribution. In view of this observation, StageOpt allows users to overcome this obstacle and to better design perforation design by focusing on both fluid and proppant distribution between clusters. The algorithm in StageOpt is based primarily on the paper Dontsov (2023), but it also incorporates practically important features, such as the effect of stress shadow from previous stage, perforation erosion, and other phenomena. In this write-up, flow distribution between perforations is described first, and the effects of perforation friction, near-wellbore pressure drop, as well as perforation break down and stress shadow are included. Then, proppant distribution between perforations is discussed as a function of perforation orientation. Finally, perforation erosion is added to the model. The erosion changes perforation diameter as a function of several parameters, including the flow rate through the perforation as well as the amount of proppant that flows through it. The change of perforation size in turn changes magnitude of perforation friction, which then changes the distribution of slurry, that consequently changes proppant flow distribution. Such a coupled system often leads to complex results that are hard to deduce without systematic physical modeling, which is exactly what StageOpt provides.</description>
