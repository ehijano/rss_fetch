      <title>Spatiotemporal Superfocusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfocusing confines light within subwavelength structures, breaking the diffraction limit. Structures with spatial singularities, such as metallic cones, are crucial to enable nanoscale focusing, leading to significant advancements in nanophotonics, sensing, and imaging. Here, we exploit the spatiotemporal analogue of the wedge structure, i.e. a dielectric medium sandwiched between two subluminal interfaces with distinct velocities, to focus propagating waves beyond the diffraction limit, achieving spatiotemporal superfocusing. Within this structure, an incident pulse undergoes continuous spatial and temporal compression due to Doppler effects, which accumulates and results in an extreme focusing as it approaches the spatiotemporal vertex. Remarkably, unlike the field localization in conventional superfocusing, the compressed light in spatiotemporal wedges experiences significant amplification and then couple to the far field in free space. Our findings represent an indispensable paradigm for extreme concentration and amplification of propagating waves in space-time dimensions.</description>

      <title>BOSON$^{-1}$: Understanding and Enabling Physically-Robust Photonic Inverse Design with Adaptive Variation-Aware Subspace Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonic device design aims to optimize photonic structures to meet specific requirements across various applications. Inverse design has unlocked non-intuitive, high-dimensional design spaces, enabling the discovery of high-performance devices beyond heuristic or analytic methods. The adjoint method, which calculates gradients for all variables using just two simulations, enables efficient navigation of this complex space. However, many inverse-designed structures, while numerically plausible, are difficult to fabricate and sensitive to variations, limiting their practical use. The discrete nature with numerous local-optimal structures also pose significant optimization challenges, often causing gradient-based methods to converge on suboptimal designs. In this work, we formulate inverse design as a fabrication-restricted, discrete, probabilistic optimization problem and introduce BOSON-1, an end-to-end, variation-aware subspace optimization framework to address the challenges of manufacturability, robustness, and optimizability. To overcome optimization difficulty, we propose dense target-enhanced gradient flows to mitigate misleading local optima and introduce a conditional subspace optimization strategy to create high-dimensional tunnels to escape local optima. Furthermore, we significantly reduce the runtime associated with optimizing across exponential variation samples through an adaptive sampling-based robust optimization, ensuring both efficiency and variation robustness. On three representative photonic device benchmarks, our proposed inverse design methodology BOSON^-1 delivers fabricable structures and achieves the best convergence and performance under realistic variations, outperforming prior arts with 74.3% post-fabrication performance. We open-source our codes at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/BOSON.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Walk Comb Source at Telecommunication Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a quantum walk comb in synthetic frequency space formed by externally modulating a semiconductor optical amplifier operating in the telecommunication wavelength range in a unidirectional ring cavity. The ultrafast gain saturation dynamics of the gain medium and its operation at high current injections is responsible for the stabilization of the comb in a broad frequency modulated state. Our device produces a nearly flat broadband comb with a tunable repetition frequency reaching a bandwidth of 1.8THz at the fundamental repetition rate of 1GHz while remaining fully locked to the RF drive. Comb operation at harmonics of the repetition rate up to 14.1GHz is also demonstrated. This approach paves the way for next-generation optical frequency comb devices with potential applications in precision ranging and high-speed communications.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Lensless Imaging with Active Metasurfaces and Single-Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a conceptual framework for a lensless imaging system which employs an active metasurface as a high-frequency, continuously tunable amplitude and phase modulation aperture, coupled to a discrete single-pixel detector. Using an array factor formalism, we first study fundamental limits in information collection, offering a comparison to existing technologies. We also study the effects of modulation rate and losses on the system acquisition time and signal-to-noise ratio, which place bounds on system performance for set illumination conditions. Considering both an ideal metasurface and the phase and amplitude modulation characteristics of an experimentally realized indium tin oxide-based metasurface operating at 1510 nm, we then simulate image recovery with ~60,000 image points for a 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm active metasurface aperture. We show that aberrations appearing in the simulated images produced by the metasurface can be corrected through post-processing. We further investigate trade-offs between image acquisition time and image quality both through the realization of Hadamard coupling bases and by modifying the k-space width coupling to the detector. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges which remain to be overcome for experimental realization of a lensless single-pixel imaging technology.</description>

      <title>Broadband and Accurate Electric Tuning of On-Chip Efficient Nonlinear Parametric Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip nonlinear photonic conversion functions with wide and precise tunability as well as high conversion efficiency are highly desirable for a wide range of applications. Photonic crystal micro-ring resonators (PhCR) facilitate efficient nonlinear conversion and enable wavenumber-accurate selection of converted optical modes, but do not support post-fabrication reconfiguration of these operational modes. Coupled-ring resonators, on the other hand, allows post-fabrication reconfiguration but suffers from ambiguity in mode selectivity. We propose a novel segmented photonic crystal micro-ring resonator featuring half-circumference gratings that decouples the locking between the grating Bragg reflection peak and micro-ring resonance frequencies. By introducing complementary thermos-optical controllers that allow differential tuning between the grating reflection peak and the micro-ring resonance, the device supports electrically reconfigurable wavenumber-accurate optical mode selectivity, experimentally demonstrated as a voltage-tunable, power-efficient optical parametric oscillator. The device demonstrates electric tuning of signal and idler frequencies both in a per-FSR stepwise manner and in a gap-free continuous manner, achieving a broad optical frequency tuning range of &gt; 5 THz and a conversion efficiency of &gt;25%. The novel approach introduces unprecedented design flexibility as well as high and precise reconfigurability to integrated nonlinear photonics, providing a new pathway towards future high-performance on-chip nonlinear light sources.</description>

      <title>Hearing carrier-envelope offset frequency and phase in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely nonlinear interactions between intense light pulses and atoms or molecules can generate new frequencies. Here, we observed high-order harmonics of acoustic waves in laser-induced plasma in air ionized by carrier-envelope offset phase (CEP) stabilized sub-4 femtosecond pulses. The frequency spacing of the acoustic harmonics corresponds to the laser repetition rate, with the harmonic order reaching beyond one hundred. Remarkably, the acoustic harmonic intensity was found to depend on the CEP of the driving light pulses. Furthermore, the carrier-envelope offset frequency of optical frequency combs can be directly measured in the acoustic spectrum, revealing an ultralong coherence preservation from attoseconds to milliseconds in the light-induced plasma. We demonstrate an application of pulse characterization based on these acoustic harmonic waves. Our study underscores the emergence of acoustic frequency combs in kilohertz and megahertz regimes, with potential implications for frequency metrology and ultrafast science.</description>

      <title>Observation of optical chaotic solitons and modulated subharmonic route to chaos in mode-locked laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal a new scenario for the transition of solitons to chaos in a mode-locked fiber laser: the modulated subharmonic route. Its universality is confirmed in two different laser configurations, namely, a figure-of-eight and a ring laser. Numerical simulations of the laser models agree well with the experiments. The modulated subharmonic route to chaos could stimulate parallel research in many nonlinear physical systems.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Transverse Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Enhancement in Mie-resonant Nanowire-based Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancement and tailoring of the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) in hybrid metasurfaces comprising rectangular silicon nanowires coupled with a nickel substrate are demonstrated. The excitation of Mie modes of different orders in nanowires causes the enhancement. The in-plane magnetic dipole mode leads to the largest TMOKE enhancement compared to other Mie modes. Changing the width of silicon nanowires leads to a modification of that mode, thereby ensuring the tailoring of the TMOKE within the range of $2.2\% - 3.8\%$. This tunability is associated with the modification of the near-field localized at the Si/Ni interface and the far-field response of the excited magnetic dipole mode. Adjusting these two quantities allows one to achieve the highest values of the TMOKE caused by individual Mie modes in silicon nanowires.</description>

      <title>Gradient Optical Diffraction Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) enables non-invasive information-rich 3D refractive index (RI) reconstruction of unimpaired transparent biological and technical samples, crucial in biomedical research, optical metrology, materials sciences, and other fields. ODT bypasses the inherent limitations of 2D integrated quantitative phase imaging methods. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio easy-to-implement common-path shearing interferometry setups are successfully combined with low spatiotemporal coherence of illumination. The need for self-interference generated holograms, with small shear values, critically impedes the analysis of dense and thick samples, e.g., cell cultures, tissue sections, and embryos/organoids. Phase gradient imaging techniques, deployed as a popular solution in the small shear regime, up to now were constrained to 2D integrated quasi-quantitative phase imaging and z-scanning for depth resolution. To fill this significant scientific gap, we propose a novel gradient optical diffraction tomography (GODT) method. The GODT uses coherence-tailored illumination-scanning sequence of phase gradient measurements to tomographically reconstruct, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a derivative of the 3D RI distribution (in the shear direction) with clearly visible 3D sample structure and high sensitivity to its spatial variations. We present a mathematically rigorous theory based on the first-order Rytov approximation behind the new method, validate it using simulations deploying numerical Shepp-Logan target and corroborate experimentally via successful tomographic imaging of the calibrated nano-printed cell phantom and efficient examination of neural cells. This novel imaging modality opens new possibilities in biomedical quantitative phase imaging, advancing the field and putting forward a first of a kind contrast domain: 3D RI gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its excellent performance in microelectronic industry, silicon was not able to perform well in photonic devices arena. This is because the silicon has never been a good optical source mainly due to its indirect band gap structure. Many of the device functionalities in silicon have been reported, with an exception of, until recently, a reliable optical source. Silicon is a nonlinear material which makes use of its nonlinearities to realize various functionalities. This paper presents a theoretical treatment of generating and enhancing third-harmonic field which may be used as optical source, crystal state monitoring and all-optical signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Lightweight holographic near-eye display system with self-charging capability using solar energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-eye display plays an important role in emerging spatial computing systems, providing a distinctive visual effect of virtual-real fusion. However, its application for all-day wear is greatly limited by the bulky structure, energy expenditure, and continuous battery heating. Here, we propose a lightweight holographic near-eye display system that takes advantage of solar energy for self-charging. To achieve the collection of solar energy and near-eye display without crosstalk, holographic optical elements (HOE) are used to diffract sunlight and signal light into a common waveguide. Then, small-area solar cells convert the collected solar energy and power the system. Compact power supply components replace heavy batteries, contributing to the lightweight design. The simple acquisition of solar energy provides the system with sustainable self-charging capability. We believe that the lightweight design and continuous energy input solution will significantly promote the popularity of near-eye display in our daily lives.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian topology from optical loss modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay of non-Hermiticity and topology is crucial given the intrinsic openness of most natural and engineered systems and it has important ramifications in topological lasers and sensors. Intense efforts have been devoted to unveiling how non-Hermiticity may impact the most significant features of topological systems, but only recently it has been theoretically proposed that topological features could originate solely from the system's non-Hermiticity in photonic systems. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the appearance of non-Hermitian topology exclusively from loss modulation in a photonic system that is topologically trivial in the absence of loss. We do this by implementing a non-Hermitian generalization of an Aubry-Andre-Harper model with purely imaginary potential in a programmable integrated photonics platform, which allows us to investigate different periodic and quasi-periodic configurations of the model. In both cases, we show the emergence of topological edge modes and explore their resilience to different kinds of disorder. Our work highlights loss engineering as a mechanism to generate topological properties.</description>

Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of materials at the nanoscale, offering unique insights into the behavior of photonic and plasmonic materials under electron excitation. We introduce an atlas of bulk CL spectra for a range of materials widely used in photonics and plasmonics. Through a combination of experimental CL spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize electron penetration depth and energy deposition, offering a foundational reference for interpreting CL spectra and understanding material behavior under electron excitation. By capturing CL signal from a diverse range of materials, this atlas provides insights into the intrinsic emission properties essential for material selection and design in photonic and plasmonic device engineering.</description>

      <title>Scalable Feedback Stabilization of Quantum Light Sources on a CMOS Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics is a leading platform for realizing the vast numbers of physical qubits needed for useful quantum information processing because it leverages mature complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing to integrate on-chip thousands of optical devices for generating and manipulating quantum states of light. A challenge to the practical operation and scale-up of silicon quantum-photonic integrated circuits, however, is the need to control their extreme sensitivity to process and temperature variations, free-carrier and self-heating nonlinearities, and thermal crosstalk. To date these challenges have been partially addressed using bulky off-chip electronics, sacrificing many benefits of a chip-scale platform. Here, we demonstrate the first electronic-photonic quantum system-on-chip (EPQSoC) consisting of quantum-correlated photon-pair sources stabilized via on-chip feedback control circuits, all fabricated in a high-volume 45nm CMOS microelectronics foundry. We use non-invasive photocurrent sensing in a tunable microring cavity photon-pair source to actively lock it to a fixed pump laser while operating in the quantum regime, enabling large scale microring-based quantum systems. In this first demonstration of such a capability, we achieve a high CAR of 134 with an ultra-low g(2)(0) of 0.021 at 2.2 kHz off-chip detected pair rate and 3.3 MHz/mW2 on-chip pair generation efficiency, and over 100 kHz off-chip detected pair rate at higher pump powers (1.5 MHz on-chip). These sources maintain stable quantum properties in the presence of temperature variations, operating reliably in practical settings with many adjacent devices creating thermal disturbances on the same chip. Such dense electronic-photonic integration enables implementation and control of quantum-photonic systems at the scale required for useful quantum information processing with CMOS-fabricated chips.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear techniques for few-mode wavefront sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present several nonlinear wavefront sensing techniques for few-mode sensors, all of which are empirically calibrated and agnostic to the choice of wavefront sensor. The first class of techniques involves a straightforward extension of the linear phase retrieval scheme to higher order; the resulting Taylor polynomial can then be solved using the method of successive approximations, though we discuss alternate methods such as homotopy continuation. In the second class of techniques, a model of the WFS intensity response is created using radial basis function interpolation. We consider both forward models, which map phase to intensity and can be solved with nonlinear least-squares methods such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as well as backwards models which directly map intensity to phase and do not require a solver. We provide demonstrations for both types of techniques in simulation using a quad-cell sensor and a photonic lantern wavefront sensor as examples. Next, we demonstrate how the nonlinearity of an arbitrary sensor may studied using the method of numerical continuation, and apply this technique both to the quad-cell sensor and a photonic lantern sensor. Finally, we briefly consider the extension of nonlinear techniques to polychromatic sensors.</description>

Abstract: Coupled-mode theory (CMT) is a powerful tool for simulating near-harmonic systems. In telecommunications, variations of the theory have been used extensively to study waveguides, both analytically and through numerical modelling. Analogous mathematical techniques to the CMT are also widely used in quantum mechanics. The purpose of this work is to collect different formulations of the CMT and their underlying connections to quantum mechanical techniques, and to showcase their utility in modelling slowly varying waveguides including directional couplers and photonic lanterns. My choice of example waveguides is motivated by the astronomical applications of such devices in starlight nulling, wavefront sensing, and high-resolution spectroscopy. I first provide a brief review of the standard form of the CMT, applicable for waveguides with fixed eigenmodes. Next, I show that the CMT also applies for slowly varying waveguides, and demonstrate the close relation between the CMT and several well-known approximation methods from quantum mechanics, as well as concepts like geometric phase. Finally, I present a verification of my analysis, in the form of the numerical package cbeam.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Effects in Dicke models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dicke model, which describes the collective interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a single-mode photon field, serves as a fundamental framework for studying light-matter interactions and quantum electrodynamic phenomena. In this work, we investigate the manifestation of non-Hermitian effects in a generalized Dicke model, where two dissipative atom ensembles interact with a single-mode photon field. By applying the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we explore the system in the semiclassical limit as a non-Hermitian Dicke model, revealing rich exceptional points (EPs) and diabolic points in such a system. We find that, by introducing the nonlinear saturation gain into an atomic ensemble, higher-order EP can be induced, leading to intriguing properties. Furthermore, if the system is extended to a one-dimensional chain, then the band topology will interplay with the non-Hermitian effect. In the quantum regime, we explore the quantum signature of EPs, noting that the conditions for their emergence are influenced by discrete photon numbers. We further study the transition from photon anti-bunching to bunching at a steady state, driven by non-Hermitian dynamics. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian physics in light-matter interaction which is instructive for the design of advanced photonic and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>One-Sided Device-Independent Random Number Generation Through Fiber Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomness is an essential resource and plays important roles in various applications ranging from cryptography to simulation of complex systems. Certified randomness from quantum process is ensured to have the element of privacy but usually relies on the device's behavior. To certify randomness without the characterization for device, it is crucial to realize the one-sided device-independent random number generation based on quantum steering, which guarantees security of randomness and relaxes the demands of one party's device. Here, we distribute quantum steering between two distant users through a 2 km fiber channel and generate quantum random numbers at the remote station with untrustworthy device. We certify the steering-based randomness by reconstructing covariance matrix of the Gaussian entangled state shared between distant parties. Then, the quantum random numbers with a generation rate of 7.06 Mbits/s are extracted from the measured amplitude quadrature fluctuation of the state owned by the remote party. Our results demonstrate the first realization of steering-based random numbers extraction in a practical fiber channel, which paves the way to the quantum random numbers generation in asymmetric networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broken symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining the macroscopic electrical, optical, magnetic, and topological properties of materials. Circular dichroism (CD) has been widely employed to probe broken symmetry in various systems, from small molecules to bulk crystals, but designing CD responses on demand remains a challenge, especially for antiferromagnetic materials. Here, we develop a cavity-enhanced CD technique to sensitively probe the magnetic order and broken symmetry in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By introducing interfacial inversion asymmetry in cavity-coupled FePS3 crystals, we demonstrate that the induced CD is strongly coupled with the zig-zag antiferromagnetic order of FePS3 and can be tuned both spectrally and in magnitude by varying the cavity length and FePS3 thickness. Our findings open new avenues for using cavity-modulated CD as a sensitive diagnostic probe to detect weak broken symmetries, particularly at hidden interfaces, and in systems exhibiting hidden spin polarization or strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Trapped-ion laser cooling in structured light fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring fluctuations in matter's low energy excitations is the key to unveil the nature of the nonequilibrium response of materials. A promising outlook in this respect is offered by spectroscopic methods that address matter fluctuations by exploiting the statistical nature of light-matter interactions with weak few-photon probes. Here we report the first implementation of ultrafast phase randomized tomography, combining pump-probe experiments with quantum optical state tomography, to measure the ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics in complex materials. Our approach utilizes a time-resolved multimode heterodyne detection scheme with phase-randomized coherent ultrashort laser pulses, overcoming the limitations of phase-stable configurations and enabling a robust reconstruction of the statistical distribution of phase-averaged optical observables. This methodology is validated by measuring the coherent phonon response in $\alpha$-quartz. By tracking the dynamics of the shot-noise limited photon number distribution of few-photon probes with ultrafast resolution, our results set an upper limit to the non-classical features of phononic state in $\alpha$-quartz and provide a pathway to access nonequilibrium quantum fluctuations in more complex quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Spectral Windings and Skin Modes through Nonconservative Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has revolutionized our understanding of wave propagation in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting unexpected localization effects beyond conventional theories. Here, we discover that NHSE, accompanied by multitype spectral phases, can be induced by manipulating nonconservative couplings. By characterizing the spectra through the windings of the energy bands, we demonstrate that band structures with identical, opposite, and even twisted windings can be achieved. These inequivalent types of spectra originate from the multichannel interference resulting from the interplay between conservative and nonconservative couplings. Associated with the multitype spectra, unipolar and bipolar NHSE with different eigenmode localizations can be observed. Additionally, our findings link the nonreciprocal transmission properties of the system to multiple spectral phases, indicating a connection with the skin modes. This paper paves new pathways for investigating non-Hermitian topological effects and manipulating nonreciprocal energy flow.</description>

      <title>Breaking the angular dispersion limit in thin film optics by ultra-strong light-matter coupling</title>

Abstract: Thin film interference is integral to modern photonics and optoelectronics, e.g. allowing for precise design of high performance optical filters, efficiency enhancements in photovoltaics and light-emitting devices, as well as the realization of microlasers and high-performance photodetectors. However, interference inevitably leads to a change of spectral characteristics with angle, which is generally undesired and can limit the usefulness of thin-film coatings and devices. Here, we introduce a strategy to overcome this fundamental limit in optics by utilizing and tuning the exciton-polariton modes arising in ultra-strongly coupled microcavities. We demonstrate optical filters with narrow pass bands that shift by less than their half width (&lt;15 nm) even at extreme angles. Our filters cover the entire visible range and surpass comparable metal-dielectric-metal filters in all relevant metrics. By expanding this strategy to strong coupling with the photonic sidebands of dielectric multilayer stacks, we also obtain filters with high extinction ratios and up to 98% peak transmission. Based on these findings, we realize ultrathin and flexible narrowband filter films, monolithically integrate our filters with organic photodiodes, and demonstrate polarization-sensitive polariton filters. These results illustrate how strong coupling provides additional degrees of freedom in thin film optics that will enable a multitude of exciting new applications in micro-optics, sensing, and biophotonics.</description>

      <title>A simple accurate way to model noise-seeded ultrafast nonlinear processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise can play an important role in nonlinear pulse propagation. It is not only the origin of fluctuations in supercontinuum but can also determine the generated signal amplitude and phase, as seen in phenomena such as noise-seeded four-wave mixing and spontaneous Raman scattering. Current models rely on input-pulse shot noise and Raman Langevin term to simulate noise-seeded Kerr effects and spontaneous Raman scattering, respectively. However, they cannot accurately simulate any nonlinear effects exhibiting asymmetries, for example, between spontaneous Stokes and anti-Stokes generation, or in amplification with emission and absorption cross sections. Moreover, combining these two techniques does not lead to accurate modeling of both effects simultaneously, especially in unsaturated Raman operational regimes or supercontinuum where spontaneous Raman emission noise plays a crucial role. To resolve this issue, we propose a new modified shot-noise model by directly introducing noise into the pulse propagation equation. It minimally modifies current models that contain only stimulated terms.</description>

      <title>RCS prediction and optimization for anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis: measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given parasitic direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. However, this first study did not include any experimental exploration to verify the theoretical results. To complete this study, this work presents an experimental validation of the proposed design, with a focus on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the considered parasitic direction. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a nontrivial Chern number results in quantized Hall conductance. What is less known is that, generically, the Hall response can be dramatically different from its quantized value in materials with broken inversion symmetry. This stems from the leading Hall contribution beyond the linear order, known as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). While the BCD is in principle always present, it is typically very small outside of a narrow window close to a topological transition and is thus experimentally elusive without careful tuning of external fields, temperature, or impurities. In this work, we transcend this challenge by devising optical driving and quench protocols that enable practical and direct access to large BCD and nonlinear Hall responses. Varying the amplitude of an incident circularly polarized laser drives a topological transition between normal and Chern insulator phases, and importantly allows the precise unlocking of nonlinear Hall currents comparable to or larger than the linear Hall contributions. This strong BCD engineering is even more versatile with our two-parameter quench protocol, as demonstrated in our experimental proposal. Our predictions are expected to hold qualitatively across a broad range of Hall materials, thereby paving the way for the controlled engineering of nonlinear electronic properties in diverse media.</description>

      <title>Automated modal analysis of entanglement with bipartite self-configuring optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a unique feature of quantum mechanics. In coupled systems of light and matter, entanglement manifests itself in the linear superposition of multipartite quantum states (e.g., parametrized by the multiple spatial, spectral, or temporal degrees of freedom of a light field). In bipartite systems, the Schmidt decomposition provides a modal decomposition of the entanglement structure over independent, separable states. Although ubiquitous as a mathematical tool to describe and measure entanglement, there exists no general efficient experimental method to decompose a bipartite quantum state onto its Schmidt modes. Here, we propose a method that relies on bipartite self-configuring optics that automatically ``learns'' the Schmidt decomposition of an arbitrary pure quantum state. Our method is agnostic to the degrees of freedom over which quantum entanglement is distributed and can reconstruct the Schmidt modes and values by variational optimization of the network's output powers or coincidences. We illustrate our method with numerical examples of spectral entanglement analysis for biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion and provide experimental guidelines for its realization, including the influence of losses and impurities. Our method provides a versatile and scalable way of analyzing entanglement in bipartite integrated quantum photonic systems.</description>

Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare methods for signal classification applied to voltage traces from transition edge sensors (TES) which are photon-number resolving detectors fundamental for accessing quantum advantages in information processing, communication and metrology. We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.</description>
