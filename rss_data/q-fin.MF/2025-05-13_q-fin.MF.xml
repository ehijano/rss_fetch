      <title>Mean Field Portfolio Games with Epstein-Zin Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean field portfolio games under Epstein-Zin preferences, which naturally encompass the classical time-additive power utility as a special case. In a general non-Markovian framework, we establish a uniqueness result by proving a one-to-one correspondence between Nash equilibria and the solutions to a class of BSDEs. A key ingredient in our approach is a necessary stochastic maximum principle tailored to Epstein-Zin utility and a nonlinear transformation. In the deterministic setting, we further derive an explicit closed-form solution for the equilibrium investment and consumption policies.</description>

      <title>Measuring Financial Resilience Using Backward Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the resilience rate as a measure of financial resilience. It captures the rate at which a dynamic risk evaluation recovers, i.e., bounces back, after the risk-acceptance set is breached. We develop the associated stochastic calculus by establishing representation theorems of a suitable time-derivative of solutions to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jumps, evaluated at stopping times. These results reveal that our resilience rate can be represented as an expectation of the generator of the BSDE. We also introduce resilience-acceptance sets and study their properties in relation to both the resilience rate and the dynamic risk measure. We illustrate our results in several examples.</description>

      <title>The Exploratory Multi-Asset Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the continuous-time multi-asset mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, specifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, in the time-varying financial market. A family of Gaussian portfolio selections is derived, and a policy iteration process is crafted to learn the optimal exploratory portfolio selection. We prove the convergence of the policy iteration process theoretically, based on which the SAC algorithm is developed. To improve the algorithm's stability and the learning accuracy in the multi-asset scenario, we divide the model parameters that influence the optimal portfolio selection into three parts, and learn each part progressively. Numerical studies in the simulated and real financial markets confirm the superior performance of the proposed SAC algorithm under various criteria.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Across Fixed-Income Product Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for transfer learning of discount curves across different fixed-income product classes. Motivated by challenges in estimating discount curves from sparse or noisy data, we extend kernel ridge regression (KR) to a vector-valued setting, formulating a convex optimization problem in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Each component of the solution corresponds to the discount curve implied by a specific product class. We introduce an additional regularization term motivated by economic principles, promoting smoothness of spread curves between product classes, and show that it leads to a valid separable kernel structure. A main theoretical contribution is a decomposition of the vector-valued RKHS norm induced by separable kernels. We further provide a Gaussian process interpretation of vector-valued KR, enabling quantification of estimation uncertainty. Illustrative examples demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves extrapolation performance and tightens confidence intervals compared to single-curve estimation.</description>

      <title>Market information of the fractional stochastic regularity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fractional Stochastic Regularity Model (FSRM) is an extension of Black-Scholes model describing the multifractal nature of prices. It is based on a multifractional process with a random Hurst exponent $H_t$, driven by a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. When the regularity parameter $H_t$ is equal to $1/2$, the efficient market hypothesis holds, but when $H_t\neq 1/2$ past price returns contain some information on a future trend or mean-reversion of the log-price process. In this paper, we investigate some properties of the fOU process and, thanks to information theory and Shannon's entropy, we determine theoretically the serial information of the regularity process $H_t$ of the FSRM, giving some insight into one's ability to forecast future price increments and to build statistical arbitrages with this model.</description>

      <title>Robust Asset-Liability Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How should financial institutions hedge their balance sheets against interest rate risk when managing long-term assets and liabilities? We address this question by proposing a bond portfolio solution based on ambiguity-averse preferences, which generalizes classical immunization and accommodates arbitrary liability structures, portfolio constraints, and interest rate perturbations. In a further extension, we show that the optimal portfolio can be computed as a simple generalized least squares problem, making the solution both transparent and computationally efficient. The resulting portfolio also reduces leverage by implicitly regularizing the portfolio weights, which enhances out-of-sample performance. Numerical evaluations using both empirical and simulated yield curves from a no-arbitrage term structure model support the feasibility and accuracy of our approach relative to existing methods.</description>
