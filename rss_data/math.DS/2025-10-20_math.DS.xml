      <title>Periodic solutions of autonomous $S^1$-symmetric Newtonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to formulate necessary conditions and sufficient ones for the existence of closed connected sets of nonstationary $2 \pi$-periodic solutions of $S^1$-symmetric Newtonian systems in $C_{2 \pi}([0,2\pi],\Omega) \times (0,+ \infty)$. As the main topological tool we apply the degree for equivariant gradient maps.</description>

      <title>The VIVID function for numerically continuing periodic orbits arising from grazing bifurcations of hybrid dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic orbits of systems of ordinary differential equations can be found and continued numerically by following fixed points of Poincar\'e maps. However, this often fails near grazing bifurcations where a periodic orbit collides tangentially with a boundary of phase space. Failure occurs when the map contains a square-root singularity and the root-finding algorithm searches beyond the domain of viable values. We show that by instead following the zeros of a function that maps Velocity Into Variation In Displacement (VIVID) this issue is circumvented and there is no such failure. We illustrate this with a prototypical one-degree-of-freedom impact oscillator model by applying Newton's method to the VIVID function to follow periodic orbits collapsing into grazing bifurcations. We also follow curves of saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits that issue from a codimension-two resonant grazing bifurcation. The VIVID function provides a simple alternative to the more sophisticated collocation method and enables periodic orbits and their bifurcations to be resolved easily and accurately near grazing bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Common Fixed Point Theorems Of Weakly Compatible Maps Satisfying (f,g)-Weakly Contractive Condition And Invariant Approximation Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of common fixed points for three selfmaps $T,f$ and $g$ defined on a metric space $(X,d)$ satisfying, $T$ is $(f,g)$-weakly contractive; and the pairs $(T,f)$ and $(T,g)$ are weakly compatible. Also, for such $T,f$ and $g$, we prove the convergence of modified Mann iteration and modified Ishikawa iteration with respect to $T,f$ and $g$ to their common fixed point, in a normed space. Further, we obtain invariant approximation results from the set of best approximations to common fixed points of $T,f$ and $g$.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of second-order Kuramoto model with frustration on strongly connected digraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergent behavior of a second-order Kuramoto-type model with frustration effect on a strongly connected digraph. The main challenge arises from the lack of symmetry in this system, which renders standard approaches for symmetric models, such as the gradient-flow method and classical $\ell^p$ or $\ell^\infty$-type energy estimates, ineffective. To address these difficulties, our primary contribution is the development of time-dependent weighted $\ell^1$-type energy estimates to establish the hypo-coercivity of the frequency diameter. Specifically, we construct novel energy functions incorporating convex combinations of phases, frequencies, accelerations, and jerks, which are shown to be dissipative and capable of bounding both phase and frequency diameters. This framework enables us to demonstrate the emergence of frequency synchronization with an exponential convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a multifractal analysis of Birkhoff averages for interval maps with finitely many branches and parabolic fixed points. Using the thermodynamic approach, we strengthen the results of Johansson et al. on the conditional variational principle for the multifractal spectra of Birkhoff averages. To do this, we develop several refined properties of the thermodynamic formalism for non-uniformly expanding interval maps.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of $\psi$-well approximable numbers and self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\psi:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be a monotonically non-increasing function, and let $\psi_v:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be defined by $\psi_v(q)=1/q^v$. In this article, we consider self-similar sets whose iterated function systems satisfy the open set condition. For functions $\psi$ that do not decrease too rapidly, we give a conjecturally sharp upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of $\psi$-well approximable numbers and such self-similar sets. When $\psi=\psi_v$ for some $v$ greater than 1 and sufficiently close to $1$, we give a lower bound for this Hausdorff dimension, which asymptotically matches the upper bound as $v\downarrow 1$. In particular, we show that the set of very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within self-similar sets, thus confirming a conjecture of Levesley, Salp, and Velani.</description>

      <title>Practicalities of State-Dependent and Threshold Delay Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delays are ubiquitous in applied problems, but often do not arise as the simple constant discrete delays that analysts and numerical analysts like to treat. In this chapter we show how state-dependent delays arise naturally when modeling and the consequences that follow. We treat discrete state-dependent delays, and delays implicitly defined by threshold conditions. We will consider modeling, formulation as dynamical systems, linearization, and numerical techniques. For discrete state-dependent delays we show how breaking points can be tracked efficiently to preserve the order of numerical methods for simulating solutions. For threshold conditions we will discuss how a velocity ratio term arises in models, and present a heuristic linearization method that avoids Banach spaces and sun-star calculus, making the method accessible to a wider audience. We will also discuss numerical implementations of threshold and distributed delay problems which allows them to be treated numerically with standard software.</description>

Abstract: Fix $c\in (1,23/22)$. Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be two distinct non-zero real numbers with $|\alpha|\neq |\beta|$. It is shown that for any measure preserving system $(X,\mathcal{X},\mu,T)$ and any $f,g\in L^{\infty}(\mu)$, the limit \begin{equation*} \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}f(T^{\lfloor \alpha n^c \rfloor}x)g(T^{\lfloor \beta n^c \rfloor}x) \end{equation*} exists for $\mu$-a.e. $x\in X$. Meanwhile, a multidimensional version of the above result is also presented.</description>

      <title>Characterizing expansivity through $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study expansive homeomorphisms of a compact metric space $X$ through the lens of the commutative $C^*$-algebra $C(X)$ of continuous complex-valued functions, viewed as observables of the system. We introduce the notion of expansive observables: elements of $C(X)$ whose level sets distinguish distinct orbits. We prove that the expansive observables form an F$_\sigma$-subalgebra of $C(X)$, and we characterize them completely for connected equicontinuous homeomorphisms, showing that only constant observables are expansive in this setting. Furthermore, we establish that topologically conjugate homeomorphisms share the same algebra of expansive observables. Using this framework, we show that the set of periodic points intersects at most countably many level sets of any expansive observable. This provides $C^*$-algebraic proofs of well-known facts like for instance that the set of periodic points of an expansive homeomorphism is countable or that the sole continuum exhibiting homeomorphisms which are both expansive and equicontinuous are the degenerated ones. Finally, we prove that no homeomorphism of the circle or the unit interval admits a dense set of expansive observables, yielding a $C^*$-algebraic demonstration of the nonexistence of expansive homeomorphisms in these spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological dynamical system $(X,T)$ is called CF-Nil($k$) if it is strictly ergodic and the maximal measurable and maximal topological $k$-step pro-nilfactors coincide as measure preserving systems. Through constructing specific ``CF-Nil'' models, we prove that for any ergodic system $(X,\mathcal{X},\mu,T)$, any nilsequence $\{\psi(m,n)\}_{m,n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ and any $f_1,\dots,f_d\in L^{\infty}(\mu)$, the averages
  \begin{equation*}
  \dfrac{1}{N^{2}} \sum_{m,n=0}^{N-1} \psi(m,n)\prod_{j=1}^{d}f_{j}(T^{{m+jn}}x)
  \end{equation*}
  converge pointwise as $N$ goes to infinity. Moreover, we show the $L^2$-convergence of a certain two-dimensional averages for non-commuting transformations without zero entropy condition.</description>

      <title>The heat flow driven by the Laplacian of a directed hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a spectral and semigroup theory for Laplacians on directed hypergraphs, a setting where classical Markovian and symmetry principles of graph Laplacians break down. This framework reveals new phenomena: the heat flow may lose positivity, stochasticity, or diagonal dominance, yet regain them asymptotically under precise combinatorial conditions. We derive spectral bounds, characterize eventual positivity and contractivity in $\infty$-norm, and identify the rare cases where the flow remains Markovian. Several examples -- culminating in hypergraphs that are dual of oriented graphs as well as directed realizations of the Fano plane - highlight the genuinely higher-order nature of these dynamics.</description>

      <title>Refined methods in foliated Brouwer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Brouwer homeomorphism is a fixed-point free, orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the plane. A foundational result of Le Calvez establishes that every such homeomorphism $f$ admits an oriented planar foliation $\mathcal{F}$ such that every point $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$ can be connected to its image $f(x)$ by a path positively transverse to $\mathcal{F}$. This provides a powerful framework for analyzing the dynamics of $f$ by studying how its orbits cross the leaves of $\mathcal{F}$. In this article, we refine this framework by identifying additional qualitative dynamical information about $f$ that is encoded in $\mathcal{F}$, which can be systematically recovered through the concept of proper transverse trajectories. Later, we investigate the possible combinatorial configurations of these proper trajectories for finite collections of orbits and characterize their simplest forms. As a key application, this refined framework is used in a forthcoming work to offer a new perspective on Homotopy Brouwer Theory, originally introduced by Handel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "pyjama stripe" with parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is the set $E(\varepsilon)$ of all complex numbers $z$ such that the distance from $\Re(z)$ to the nearest integer is at most $\varepsilon$. The Pyjama Problem of Iosevich, Kolountzakis, and Matolcsi asks whether, for every choice of $\varepsilon&gt;0$, it is possible to cover the entire complex plane with finitely many rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ around the origin. Manners obtained an affirmative answer to this question by studying a $\times 2, \times 3$-type problem over a suitable solenoid. Manners's argument provided no quantitative bounds (in terms of $\varepsilon$) on the number of rotations required, and Green has highlighted the problem of obtaining such quantitative bounds. Our main result is that $\exp\exp\exp(\varepsilon^{-O(1)})$ rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ suffice to cover the complex plane. Our analysis makes use of the entropic tools developed by Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, Michel, and Venkatesh for quantitative $\times 2, \times 3$-type results.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of planar balanced configurations for the $n$-body problem in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central configurations play a fundamental role in the Newtonian $n$-body problem, as they give rise to motions in which the configuration evolves while preserving its shape up to rotation and scaling. These include relative equilibria, where the configuration rigidly rotates about the center of mass and each body moves along a circular orbit. For $d\le3$, such motions originate only from planar central configurations, whereas in higher dimensions the richer structure of the orthogonal group admits new balanced configurations that can produce non-planar relative equilibria. Building on the framework introduced by Asselle, Portaluri and Fenucci [J. Fixed Point Theory App., 2022], we analyze bifurcations of planar balanced configurations in $\mathbb{R}^4$. We extend a classical variational result, which guarantees the existence of bifurcation points along trivial branches of critical points that are degenerate only at finitely many points, to the case where the trivial branch remains degenerate throughout. Applying this extension, we establish the existence of bifurcation points along the planar balanced configuration branch and derive a lower bound on their number.</description>

To carry out this construction, we first lay theoretical foundations concerning equivariant linearization of nonlinear maps under resolutions of quotient singularities, linear models near exceptional components, Salem numbers and multipliers at periodic points, two kinds of fixed point formulas and related indices at exceptional components. Then these basic tools are combined with the method of hypergeometric groups to enable us to detect various types of rotation domains on K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>A transformal transcendence result for algebraic difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an algebraic difference equation of the form \[\sigma^n(y)=f\big(y, \sigma(y),\dots,\sigma^{n-1}(y)\big)\] where $f$ is a rational function over a field $k$ of characteristic zero on which $\sigma$ acts trivially, it is shown that if there is a nontrivial algebraic relation amongst any number of $\sigma$-disjoint solutions, along with their $\sigma$-transforms, then there is already such a relation between three solutions. Here ``$\sigma$-disjoint" means $a\neq\sigma^r(b)$ for any integer $r$. A weaker version of the theorem, where ``three" is replaced by $n+4$, is also obtained when $\sigma$ acts non-trivially on $k$. Along the way a number of other structural results about primitive rational dynamical systems are established. These theorems are deduced as applications of a detailed model-theoretic study of finite-rank quantifier-free types in the theory of existentially closed difference fields of characteristic zero. In particular, it is also shown that the degree of non-minimality of such types over fixed-field parameters is bounded by $2$.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Embedding groups into acyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that labelled Thompson groups and twisted Brin--Thompson groups are all acyclic. This allows us to prove several new embedding results for groups. First, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically as a subgroup of an acyclic group of type $F_n$ that has no proper finite-index subgroups. This improves results of Baumslag--Dyer--Heller ($n=1$) and Baumslag--Dyer--Miller ($n=2$) from the early 80s, as well as a more recent result of Bridson ($n=2$). Second, we show that every finitely generated group embeds quasi-isometrically as a subgroup of a $2$-generated, simple, acyclic group. Our results also allow us to produce, for each $n\geqslant 2$, the first known example of an acyclic group that is of type $F_n$ but not $F_{n+1}$. These examples can moreover be taken to be simple. Furthermore, our examples provide a rich source of universally boundedly acyclic groups.</description>

      <title>Connectedness of fibers beyond semitoric systems II: ephemeral singular points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we proved the connectedness of the fibers of every $2n$-dimensional integrable system satisfying both: the action extends the action of an $(n-1)$-dimensional torus which has a proper moment map, and every tall singular point is non-degenerate and no such point has a hyperbolic block and connected $T$-stabilizer. Unfortunately, these criteria are fairly restrictive. Our main goal in this paper is to find a larger class of integrable systems that has connected fibers by weakening the non-degeneracy assumption above. To achieve this, we introduce ``ephemeral" degenerate singular points, examples of which have appeared in the literature in the context of $p \! : \! -q$ resonances and special Lagrangian fibrations. Finally, we construct a family of examples that shows that our main theorem meaningfully extends previous results.</description>

      <title>On the irrationality exponent of real numbers with low complexity expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\xi$ be a real number and $b \ge 2$ an integer. We study the relationship between the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ and the subword complexity $p(n, \bfx)$ of the $b$-ary expansion $\bfx$ of $\xi$, where $p(n, \bfx)$ counts the number of distinct blocks of length $n$ in $\bfx$, for $n \ge 1$. If the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is equal to $2$, which is the case for almost all real numbers $\xi$, we show that the limit superior of the sequence $(p(n, \bfx) / n)_{n \ge 1}$ is at least equal to 4/3. The proof is based on a careful study of the evolution of the Rauzy graphs of infinite words of low complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider linear and time-dependent perturbations of periodic transport equations on the two-dimensional torus. For generic perturbations, we prove the existence of a large class of initial data whose Sobolev norms diverge exponentially fast. In higher dimensions, this remains true under a Morse-Smale assumption on the resonant part of the perturbation. In both cases, this is achieved by a normal form procedure and by studying Sobolev instabilities for time-dependent perturbations of Morse-Smale transport equations. The latter are analyzed on general compact manifolds using techniques from microlocal analysis and hyperbolic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Descriptions of Open Systems of Complex Chemical Reactions with Multiple Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general theory of a complex system of nonlinear chemical reactions is a primary language of chemistry that includes chemical engineering and cellular biochemistry. Its significance as an analytical framework, however, has not been fully appreciated outside the community of physical chemists. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in the kinetics and Gibbsian thermodynamics of chemical reactions in a spatially homogeneous aqueous solution with a multiscale perspective on complex systems. From the microscopic level of single reaction events which are purely stochastic in continuous time, one at a time among a set of molecules, to the macroscopic chemical reaction systems in bulk in terms of deterministic rate equations, the mathematical descriptions of kinetic models for chemical reactions at different levels are presented in detail, with rigorous mathematical justifications presented. In parallel with the kinetics of chemical reactions, the irreversible thermodynamics of open systems and the stochastic thermodynamics along reactions trajectories are reviewed thoroughly. As a novel feature, the mathematical theory of large deviations is shown to play a pivotal role in the thermodynamics of chemical reactions in equilibrium and in irreversible processes. This review is expected to stimulate interests in and help defining multiscale phenomena and nonequilibrium thermodynamics in many research fields on population dynamics of interacting species using chemical reactions as an analytic paradigm.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Input-Output Linearization via Dynamic Switching Between Melds of Output Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a systematic framework for switching between different sets of outputs for the control of nonlinear systems via feedback linearization. We introduce the concept of a meld to formally define a valid, feedback-linearizable subset of outputs that can be selected from a larger deck of possible outputs. The main contribution is a formal proof establishing that under suitable dwell-time and compatibility conditions, it is possible to switch between different melds while guaranteeing the uniform boundedness of the system state. We further show that the error dynamics of the active outputs remain exponentially stable within each switching interval and that outputs common to consecutive melds are tracked seamlessly through transitions. The proposed theory is valid for any feedback linearizable nonlinear system, such as, e.g., robots, aerial and terrestrial vehicles, etc.. We demonstrate it on a simple numerical simulation of a robotic manipulator.</description>

      <title>Feldman-Katok pseudometric and the GIKN construction of nonhyperbolic ergodic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:1702.01962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GIKN construction was introduced by Gorodetski, Ilyashenko, Kleptsyn, and Nalsky in [Functional Analysis and its Applications, 39 (2005), 21--30]. It gives a nonhyperbolic ergodic measure which is a weak$^*$ limit of a special sequence of measures supported on periodic orbits. This method was later adapted by numerous authors and provided examples of nonhyperbolic invariant measures in various settings. We prove that the result of the GIKN construction is always a loosely Kronecker measure in the sense of Ornstein, Rudolph, and Weiss (equivalently, standard measure in the sense of Katok, another name is loosely Bernoulli measure with zero entropy). For a proof we introduce and study the Feldman-Katok pseudometric $\bar{F_{K}}$. The pseudodistance $\bar{F_{K}}$ is a topological counterpart of the $\bar f$ metric for finite-state stationary stochastic processes introduced by Feldman and, independently, by Katok, later developed by Ornstein, Rudolph, and Weiss. We show that every measure given by the GIKN construction is the $\bar{F_{K}}$-limit of a sequence of periodic measures. On the other hand we prove that a measure which is the $\bar{F_{K}}$-limit of a sequence of ergodic measures is ergodic and its entropy is smaller or equal than the lower limit of entropies of measures in the sequence. Furthermore we demonstrate that $\bar{F_{K}}$-Cauchy sequence of periodic measures tends in the weak$^*$ topology either to a periodic measure or to a loosely Kronecker measure.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing with the Kuramoto model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing aims to achieve high-performance and low-cost machine learning with a dynamical system as a reservoir. However, in general, there are almost no theoretical guidelines for its high-performance or optimality. Therefore, this paper aims to propose the new concept {\it the edge of bifurcation} for designing a high-performance reservoir, and provide a mathematical justification for it. This concept is a generalization of the famous criterion {\it the edge of chaos}. For this purpose, this paper focuses on the reservoir computing with the Kuramoto model and theoretically reveals its approximation ability. The main result provides an explicit expression of the dynamics of the Kuramoto reservoir by using the order parameters. Thus, the output of the reservoir computing is expressed as a linear combination of the order parameters. As a corollary, sufficient conditions on hyperparameters are obtained so that the set of the order parameters gives the complete basis of the Lebesgue space. This implies that the Kuramoto reservoir has a universal approximation property. Furthermore, the edge of bifurcation is also discussed from the viewpoint of its approximation ability. It is numerically demonstrated by prediction tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, given a real or complex hyperbolic metric $g_0$ on a closed manifold $M$ of dimension $n\geq 3$, there exists a neighborhood $\mathcal U$ of $g_0$ in the space of negatively curved metrics such that for any $g\in \mathcal U$, the topological entropy and Liouville entropy of $g$ coincide if and only if $g$ and $g_0$ are homothetic. This provides a partial answer to Katok's entropy rigidity conjecture. As a direct consequence of our theorem, we obtain a local rigidity result for the hyperbolic rank and for metrics with $C^2$ Anosov foliations near complex hyperbolic metrics.</description>

Abstract: We address the question how a given connection structure (directed graph) can be realised as a heteroclinic network that is complete in the sense that it contains all unstable manifolds of its equilibria. For a directed graph consisting of two cycles we provide a constructive method to achieve this: (i) enlarge the graph by adding some edges and (ii) apply the simplex method to obtain a network in phase space. Depending on the length of the cycles we derive the minimal number of required new edges. In the resulting network each added edge leads to a positive transverse eigenvalue at the respective equilibrium. We discuss the total number of such positive eigenvalues in an individual cycle and some implications for the stability of this cycle.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in the complexified Kuramoto model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an $N$-oscillators complexified Kuramoto model. We first observe that there are solutions exhibiting finite-time blow-up behavior in all coupling regimes. When the coupling strength $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$, sufficient conditions for various types of synchronization are established for general $N \geq 2$. On the other hand, we analyze the case when the coupling strength is weak. For $N=2$ with coupling below $\lambda_c$, our complex-analytic approach not only recovers the periodic orbits reported by Th\"umler--Srinivas--Schr\"oder--Timme but also provides, for the first time, their exact period $T_{\omega,\lambda}=2\pi/\sqrt{\omega^{2}-\lambda^{2}}$, confirming full phase locking. Furthermore, for the critical case $\lambda = \lambda_c$, we find that the complexified Kuramoto system admits homoclinic orbits. These phenomena significantly differentiate the complexified Kuramoto model from the real Kuramoto system, as synchronization never occurs when $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ in the latter. For $N=3$, we demonstrate that if the natural frequencies are in arithmetic progression, non-trivial synchronization states can be achieved for certain initial conditions even when the coupling strength is weak. In particular, we characterize the critical coupling strength ($\lambda/\lambda_c = 0.85218915...$) such that a semistable equilibrium point in the real Kuramoto model bifurcates into a pair of stable and unstable equilibria, marking a new phenomenon in complexified Kuramoto models.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines a broadly applicable triangular normal form for x-flat control-affine systems with two inputs. First, we show that this triangular form encompasses a wide range of established normal forms. Next, we prove that any x-flat system can be transformed into this triangular structure after a finite number of prolongations of each input. Finally, we introduce a refined algorithm for identifying candidates for x-flat outputs. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of our results. In particular, we show that the refined algorithm exceeds the capabilities of existing methods for computing flat outputs based on triangular forms.</description>

      <title>The inference of Fokker-Planck equations via transport maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework, which, from the trajectories detailing the spatiotemporal dynamics of a population, simultaneously reconstructs a transport map as well as the Fokker-Planck equation governing the coarse-grained probability distribution. Leveraging the Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement, we model the transport map from a fixed reference distribution to the target distribution, and derive the velocity fields of the flows from the trajectory of transport maps. Exploiting the velocity fields, we circumvent spatial gradients to infer the Fokker-Planck equation's potential and diffusivity. The sparsity of trajectories injects uncertainty, which we treat in a Bayesian setting using variational inference. The approach is applied to inferring the Fokker-Planck dynamics in spaces of up to five dimensions, demonstrating both accurate identification of the system and efficiency with respect to data size.</description>

      <title>Observability and State Estimation for Smooth and Nonsmooth Differential Algebraic Equation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the sensitivity-based rank condition (SERC) test for local observability to another class of systems, namely smooth and nonsmooth differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems of index-1. The newly introduced test for DAEs, which we call the lexicographic SERC (L-SERC) observability test, utilizes the theory of lexicographic differentiation to compute sensitivity information. Moreover, the newly introduced L-SERC observability test is useful in the context of partial observability as it can judge which states are observable and which are not. Additionally, we introduce a novel sensitivity-based extended Kalman filter (S-EKF) algorithm for state estimation, applicable to both smooth and nonsmooth DAE systems. Finally, we apply the newly developed S-EKF to estimate the states of a wind turbine power system model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21522v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a generic reservoir system admits a generalized synchronization that is a topological embedding of the input system's attractor. We also prove that for sufficiently high reservoir dimension (given by Nash's embedding theorem) there exists an isometric embedding generalized synchronization. The isometric embedding can be constructed explicitly when the reservoir system and source dynamics are linear.</description>

Abstract: This paper surveys our results on integrable billiards. We consider various models of billiards, including Birkhoff, outer, magnetic, and Minkowski billiards. Also, we discuss wire billiards and billiards in cones. For four models of convex plane billiards, we also discuss an isoperimetric-type inequality for the Mather $\beta$-function.

      <description>arXiv:2510.04948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show ergodicity of (asymmetric) lemon billiards, billiard tables that are the intersection of two circles of which one contains the centers of both. These do not satisfy the Wojtkowski criteria for hyperbolicity, but we establish \emph{uniform} expansion of vectors in an invariant cone family and alignment of singularity curves. Both of these are difficult, and the approach to the latter seems new. Together, these properties imply ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a general class of models for swarming/self-collective behaviour in domains with boundaries. The model is expressed as a stochastic system of interacting particles subject to both reflecting boundary condition and common environmental noise. We rigorously derive its corresponding macroscopic mean-field equation, which is a new type of stochastic partial differential equation due to the presence of common noise. The approach relies on a compactness argument, in which we first establish the tightness of the empirical measures associated with the particle system and then demonstrate that the time marginal of the limit measure is a solution to the mean-field equation.</description>

      <title>Navigating Uncertainties in Machine Learning for Structural Dynamics: A Comprehensive Survey of Probabilistic and Non-Probabilistic Approaches in Forward and Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data, machine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool in various fields, notably impacting structural dynamics. ML algorithms offer advantages by modeling physical phenomena based on data, even in the absence of underlying mechanisms. However, uncertainties such as measurement noise and modeling errors can compromise the reliability of ML predictions, highlighting the need for effective uncertainty awareness to enhance prediction robustness. This paper presents a comprehensive review on navigating uncertainties in ML, categorizing uncertainty-aware approaches into probabilistic methods (including Bayesian and frequentist perspectives) and non-probabilistic methods (such as interval learning and fuzzy learning). Bayesian neural networks, known for their uncertainty quantification and nonlinear mapping capabilities, are emphasized for their superior performance and potential. The review covers various techniques and methodologies for addressing uncertainties in ML, discussing fundamentals and implementation procedures of each method. While providing a concise overview of fundamental concepts, the paper refrains from in-depth critical explanations. Strengths and limitations of each approach are examined, along with their applications in structural dynamic forward problems like response prediction, sensitivity assessment, and reliability analysis, and inverse problems like system identification, model updating, and damage identification. Additionally, the review identifies research gaps and suggests future directions for investigations, aiming to provide comprehensive insights to the research community. By offering an extensive overview of both probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches, this review aims to assist researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions when utilizing ML techniques to address uncertainties in structural dynamic problems.</description>

      <title>Warehouse storage and retrieval optimization via clustering, dynamical systems modeling, and GPU-accelerated routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a warehouse optimization procedure aimed at enhancing the efficiency of product storage and retrieval. By representing product locations and order flows within a time-evolving graph structure, we employ unsupervised clustering to define and refine compact order regions, effectively reducing picking distances. We describe the procedure using a dynamic mathematical model formulated using tools from random dynamical systems theory, enabling a principled analysis of the system's behavior over time even under random operational variations. For routing within this framework, we implement a parallelized Bellman-Ford algorithm, utilizing GPU acceleration to evaluate path segments efficiently. To address scalability challenges inherent in large routing graphs, we introduce a segmentation strategy that preserves performance while maintaining tractable memory requirements. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in both operational efficiency and computational feasibility for large-scale warehouse environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter reviews some aspects of the theory of age-structured models of populations with finite maximum age. We formulate both the renewal equation for the birth rate and the partial differential equation for the age density, and show their equivalence. Next, we define and discuss central concepts in population dynamics, like the basic reproduction number $R_0$, the Malthusian parameter $r$, and the stable age distribution. We briefly review the sun-star theory that turns the birth term into a bounded additive perturbation, thus allowing to develop stability and bifurcation theory along standard lines. Finally, we review the pseudospectral approximation of the infinite-dimensional age-structured models by means of a finite system of ordinary differential equations, which allows to perform numerical bifurcation analysis with existing software tools. Here, Nicholson's blowfly equation serves as a worked example.</description>

      <title>Boosting Ensembles for Statistics of Tails at Conditionally Optimal Advance Split Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate science needs more efficient ways to study high-impact, low-probability extreme events, which are rare by definition and costly to simulate in large numbers. Rare event sampling (RES) and ensemble boosting use small perturbations to turn moderate events into a severe ones, which otherwise might not come for many more simulation-years, and thus enhance sample size. But the viability of this approach hinges on two open questions: (1) are boosted events representative of the yet-unrealized events? (2) How does this depend on the specific form of perturbation, i.e., timing and structure? Timing in particular is crucial for sudden, transient events like precipitation. In this work, we formulate a concrete optimization problem for the advance split time (AST) hyperparameter, and study it on an idealized but physically informative model system: passive tracer fluctuations in a turbulent channel, which captures key elements of midlatitude storm track dynamics. Three major questions guide our investigation: (1) Can RES methods, in particular ``ensemble boosting'' equipped with a probability estimator and ``trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting'', accurately and efficiently sample extreme events? (2) What is the optimal AST, and how does it depend on the event definition, in particular the target location and surrounding flow conditions? (3) Can the AST be optimized ``online'' while running RES?
  Our answers support RES as a viable method: (1) RES can meaningfully improve tail estimation, using (2) an optimal AST of 1-3 eddy turnover timescales depending on location. (3) A ``thresholded entropy'' statistic is a good proxy for AST optimality, bypassing the tedious threshold-setting that often hinders RES methods. Our work clarifies aspects of the response function of transient extreme events to perturbations, giving a guide for designing efficient, reliable sampling strategies.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on the system of globally coupled logistic maps (GCM), a well-known model exhibiting chaotic itinerancy. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as coherent and intermittent phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if any four distinct solutions of a rational difference equation are algebraically independent, then any number of distinct solutions to the equation are independent. A nontrivial variant of this result is given for autonomous difference equations or algebraic dynamical systems, where we show the degree of nonminimality is at most one. The results have a natural interpretation in terms of invariant or periodic subvarieties of algebraic dynamical systems and $\sigma$-varieties. Surprisingly, the proofs of these results rely on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Area Law for the entanglement entropy of free fermions in nonrandom ergodic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of one of the widely used characteristics of correlations in large quantum systems. The correlations are known as quantum entanglement, the characteristic is called the entanglement entropy, and as large systems we consider an ideal gas of spinless lattice fermions. The system is determined by its one-body Hamiltonian. As shown in \cite{EPS}, if the Hamiltonian is an ergodic finite difference operator with exponentially decaying spectral projection, then the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy is the so-called Area Law. However, the only one-body Hamiltonian for which this spectral condition is verified is the $d$-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operators with random potential. In the present paper, we prove that the same asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy holds for a wide class of Schr\"odinger operators whose potentials are ergodic but nonrandom. We start with the quasiperiodic and limit periodic operators, and then pass to the interesting and highly non-trivial case of the potentials generated by subshifts of finite type. They arose in the theory of dynamical systems in the study of non-random chaotic phenomena. As it turns out, obtaining the asymptotics of the entanglement entropy of free fermions requires a quite involved spectral analysis of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. Specifically, we prove for this class two important and interesting in itself spectral properties, known as exponential dynamic localisation in expectation and the exponential decay of the eigenfunction correlator, implying the Area Law for the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Robust Closed-Form Control for MIMO Nonlinear Systems under Conflicting Time-Varying Hard and Soft Constraints (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robust closed-form control law to handle time-varying hard and soft constraints in uncertain high-relative-degree nonlinear MIMO systems. These constraints represent spatiotemporal specifications in mechanical systems' operational space, with hard constraints ensuring safety-critical requirements and soft constraints encoding performance or task objectives. Initially, all constraints are consolidated into two separate scalar time-varying hard and soft constraint functions, whose positive level sets define feasible regions. A closed-form control law is developed to enforce these constraints using appropriately designed reciprocal barriers and nonlinear transformation functions. When conflicts between hard and soft constraints arise, the control law prioritizes hard constraints by virtually relaxing soft constraints via a dynamic relaxation law. Notably, the proposed control law maintains low complexity by avoiding approximation schemes for coping with system uncertainties. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>
