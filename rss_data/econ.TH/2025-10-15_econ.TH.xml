      <title>Perceived Fairness in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual definitions of algorithmic fairness focus on population-level statistics, such as demographic parity or equal opportunity. However, in many social or economic contexts, fairness is not perceived globally, but locally, through an individual's peer network and comparisons. We propose a theoretical model of perceived fairness networks, in which each individual's sense of discrimination depends on the local topology of interactions. We show that even if a decision rule satisfies standard criteria of fairness, perceived discrimination can persist or even increase in the presence of homophily or assortative mixing. We propose a formalism for the concept of fairness perception, linking network structure, local observation, and social perception. Analytical and simulation results highlight how network topology affects the divergence between objective fairness and perceived fairness, with implications for algorithmic governance and applications in finance and collaborative insurance.</description>

      <title>Game Theory Analysis of Third-Party Regulation in Organic Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As people become more conscious of their health and the environment, the demand for organic food is expected to increase. However, distinguishing organic products from conventionally produced ones can be hard, creating a problem where producers may have the incentive to label their conventional products as organic to sell them at a higher price. Game theory can help to analyze the strategic interactions between producers and consumers in order to help consumers verifying these claims. Through a game theory analysis approach, this paper provides evidence of the need for a third party to equalize markets and foster trust in organic supply chains. Therefore, government regulation, including regular and random monitoring and certification requirements, plays a crucial role in achieving the desired level of trust and information exchange among supply chain agents, which ultimately determines the growth trajectory of the sector.</description>

      <title>When Can Communication Lead to Efficiency?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study games with incomplete information and characterize when a feasible outcome is Pareto efficient. We show that any outcome with excessive randomization over actions is inefficient. Generically, efficiency requires that the total number of actions taken across states be strictly less than the sum of the number of players and states. We then examine the efficiency of equilibrium outcomes in communication models. Generically, a cheap talk outcome is efficient only if it is pure. When the sender's payoff is state-independent, it is efficient if and only if the sender's most preferred action is chosen with certainty. In natural buyer-seller settings, Bayesian persuasion outcomes are inefficient across a wide range of priors and preferences. Finally, we show that our results apply to mechanism design problems with many players.</description>

      <title>Selection Procedures in Competitive Admission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two identical firms compete to attract and hire from a pool of candidates of unknown productivity. Firms simultaneously post a selection procedure which consists of a test and an acceptance probability for each test outcome. After observing the firms' selection procedures, each candidate can apply to one of them. Both firms have access to a limited set of feasible tests. The firms face two key considerations when choosing their selection procedure: the statistical properties of their test and the selection into the procedure by the candidates. I identify two partial orders on tests that are useful to characterise the equilibrium of this game: the test's accuracy (Lehmann, 1988) and difficulty. I show that in any symmetric equilibrium, the test chosen must be maximal in the accuracy order and minimal in the difficulty order. Intuitively, competition leads to maximal but misguided learning: firms end up having precise knowledge that is not payoff relevant. I also consider the cases where firms face capacity constraints, have the possibility of making a wage offer and the existence of asymmetric equilibria where one firm is more selective than another.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous RBCs via deep multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith (KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast, agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC, a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3) effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these often opposed modelling paradigms.</description>

      <title>Anonymity and strategy-proofness on a domain of single-peaked and single-dipped preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of locating a public facility on a line in a society where agents have either single-peaked or single-dipped preferences. We consider the domain analyzed in Alcalde-Unzu et al. (2024), where the type of preference of each agent is public information, but the location of her peak/dip as well as the rest of the preference are unknown. We characterize all strategy-proof and type-anonymous rules on this domain. Building on existing results, we provide a two-step characterization": first, the median between the peaks and a collection of fixed values is computed (Moulin, 1980), resulting in either a single alternative or a pair of contiguous alternatives. If the outcome of the median is a pair, we apply a double-quota majority method" in the second step to choose between the two alternatives in the pair (Moulin, 1983). We also show the additional conditions that type-anonymity imposes on the strategy-proof rules characterized by Alcalde-Unzu et al. (2024). Finally, we show the equivalence between the two characterizations.</description>

      <title>Does Ideological Polarization Lead to Policy Polarization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study an election between two ideologically polarized parties that are both office- and policy-motivated. The parties compete by proposing policies on a single issue. The analysis uncovers a non-monotonic relationship between ideological and policy polarization. When ideological polarization is low, an increase leads to policy moderation; when it is high, the opposite occurs, and policies become more extreme. Moreover, incorporating ideological polarization refines our understanding of the role of valence: both high- and low-valence candidates may adopt more extreme positions, depending on the electorate's degree of ideological polarization.</description>

      <title>Construction of Compromise Values for Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a broad class of values for cooperative games in characteristic function form, known as \emph{compromise values\/}. These values efficiently allocate payoffs by linearly combining well-specified upper and lower bounds on payoffs. We identify subclasses of games that admit non-trivial efficient allocations within the considered bounds, which we call \emph{bound-balanced games}. Subsequently, we define the associated compromise value. We also provide an axiomatisation of this class of compromise values using variants of the minimal rights property and restricted proportionality.
  We introduce two construction methods for properly devised compromise values. Under mild conditions, one can use either a lower or an upper bound to construct a well-defined compromise value.
  We construct and axiomatise various well-known and new compromise values based on these methods, including the $\tau$-, the $\chi$-, the Gately, the CIS-, the PANSC-, the EANSC-, and the new KM-values. We conclude that this approach establishes a common foundation for a wide range of different values.</description>

      <title>Renewable Natural Resources with Tipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the world's renewable resources are in decline. Optimal harvests with smooth recruitment is well studied but in recent years, ecologists have concluded that tipping points in recruitment are common. Recruitment with a tipping point has low-fecundity below the tipping point and high-fecundity above. When the incremental value of high-fecundity is sufficiently high, there is a high-fecundity steady-state. This steady-state is stable but in some cases, small perturbations may result in large, temporary reductions in recruitment and harvests. Below the tipping point, a low-fecundity steady-state need not exist. When a low-fecundity steady-state does exist, there is an endogenous tipping (Skiba) point: below, harvests converge to the low-fecundity steady-state and above, an austere harvest policy transitions the renewable resource to high-fecundity recruitment. If there is hysteresis in recruitment, the high steady-state may not be stable. Moreover, if the high-/low-fecundity differential is large then following a downward perturbation, fecundity optimally remains low.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of von Neumann's Reduction from the Assignment Problem to Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equivalence between von Neumann's Minimax Theorem for zero-sum games and the LP Duality Theorem connects cornerstone problems of the two fields of game theory and optimization, respectively, and has been the subject of intense scrutiny for seven decades. Yet, as observed in this paper, the proof of the difficult direction of this equivalence is unsatisfactory: It does not assign distinct roles to the two players of the game, as is natural from the definition of a zero-sum game.
  In retrospect, a partial resolution to this predicament was provided in another brilliant paper of von Neumann, which reduced the assignment problem to zero-sum games. However, the underlying LP is highly specialized; all entries of its objective function vector are strictly positive, the constraint vector is all ones, and the constraint matrix is 0/1.
  We generalize von Neumann's result along two directions, each allowing negative entries in certain parts of the LP. Our reductions make explicit the roles of the two players of the reduced game, namely their maximin strategies are to play optimal solutions to the primal and dual LPs. Furthermore, unlike previous reductions, the value of the reduced game reveals the value of the given LP. Our generalizations encompass several basic economic scenarios.</description>
