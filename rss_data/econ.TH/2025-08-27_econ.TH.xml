      <title>Delegated Contracting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal seeks to contract with an agent but must do so through an informed delegate. Although the principal cannot directly mediate the interaction, she can constrain the menus of contracts the delegate may offer. We show that the principal can implement any outcome that is implementable through a direct mechanism satisfying dominant strategy incentive compatibility and ex-post participation for the agent. We apply this result to several settings. First, we show that a government that delegates procurement to a budget-indulgent agency should delegate an interval of screening contracts. Second, we show that a seller can delegate sales to an intermediary without revenue loss, provided she can commit to a return policy. Third, in contrast to centralized mechanism design, we demonstrate that no partnership can be efficiently dissolved in the absence of a mediator. Finally, we discuss when delegated contracting obstructs efficiency, and when choosing the right delegate may help restore it.</description>

      <title>Preference for Verifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision makers may face situations in which they cannot observe the consequences that result from their actions. In such decisions, motivations other than the expected utility of consequences may play a role. The present paper axiomatically characterizes a decision model in which the decision maker cares about whether it can be ex post verified that a good consequence has been achieved. Preferences over acts uniquely characterize a set of events that the decision maker expects to be able to verify in case they occur. The decision maker chooses the act that maximizes the expected utility across verifiable events of the worst possible consequence that may have occurred.
  For example, a firm choosing between different carbon emission reduction technologies may find some technologies to leave ex post more uncertainty about the level of emission reduction than other technologies. The firm may care about proving to its stakeholders that a certain amount of carbon reduction has been achieved and may employ privately obtained evidence to do so. It may choose in expectation less efficient technologies if the achieved carbon reduction is better verifiable using the expected future evidence.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Delegation with Reputation Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamic delegation with reputation feedback: a long-lived expert advises a sequence of implementers whose effort responds to current reputation, altering outcome informativeness and belief updates. We solve for a recursive, belief-based equilibrium and show that advice is a reputation-dependent cutoff in the expert's signal. A diagnosticity condition - failures at least as informative as successes - implies reputational conservatism: the cutoff (weakly) rises with reputation. Comparative statics are transparent: greater private precision or a higher good-state prior lowers the cutoff, whereas patience (value curvature) raises it. Reputation is a submartingale under competent types and a supermartingale under less competent types; we separate boundary hitting into learning (news generated infinitely often) versus no-news absorption. A success-contingent bonus implements any target experimentation rate with a plug-in calibration in a Gaussian benchmark. The framework yields testable predictions and a measurement map for surgery (operate vs. conservative care).</description>

      <title>Public Persuasion with Endogenous Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study public persuasion when a sender faces a mass audience that can verify the state at heterogeneous costs. The sender commits ex ante to a public information policy but must satisfy an ex post truthfulness constraint on verifiable content (EPIC). Receivers verify selectively, generating a verifying mass that depends on the public posterior mu. This yields an indirect value v(mu;F) and a concavification problem under implementability. Our main result is a reverse comparative static: when verification becomes cheaper (an FOSD improvement in F), v becomes more concave and the optimal public signal is strictly less informative (Blackwell). Intuitively, greater verifiability makes extreme claims invite scrutiny, so the sender optimally coarsens information - "confusion as strategy." We extend the model to two ex post instruments: falsification (continuous manipulation) and violence (a fixed-cost discrete tool), and characterize threshold substitutions from persuasion to manipulation and repression. The framework speaks to propaganda under improving fact-checking.</description>

      <title>Risky Advice and Reputational Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study expert advice under reputational incentives, with sell-side equity research as the lead application. A long-lived analyst receives a continuous private signal about a binary payoff and recommends a risky (Buy) or safe action. Recommendations and outcomes are public, and clients' implementation effort depends on current reputation. In a recursive, belief-based equilibrium: (i) advice follows a cutoff in the signal; (ii) under a simple diagnosticity asymmetry, the cutoff is (weakly) increasing in reputation (reputational conservatism); and (iii) comparative statics are transparent - higher signal precision or a higher success prior lowers the cutoff, whereas stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus implements any target experimentation rate via a closed-form mapping. The model predicts that high-reputation analysts make fewer risky calls yet attain higher conditional hit rates, and it clarifies how committee thresholds and monitoring regimes shift behavior.</description>

      <title>Contesting fake news</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model competition on a credence goods market governed by an imperfect label, signaling high quality, as a rank-order tournament between firms. In this market interaction, asymmetric firms jointly and competitively control the aggregate precision of a label ranking the competitors' qualities by releasing individual information. While the labels and the aggregated information they are based on can be seen as a public good guiding the consumers' purchasing decisions, individual firms have incentives to strategically amplify or counteract the competitors' information emission, thereby manipulating the aggregate precision of product labeling, i.e., the underlying ranking's discriminatory power. Elements of the introduced theory are applicable to several (credence-good) industries that employ labels or rankings, including academic departments, ``green'' certification, movies, and investment opportunities.</description>

      <title>Misperception and informativeness in statistical discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of information and prior (mis)perceptions in a Phelps-Aigner-Cain-type model of statistical discrimination in the labor market. We decompose the effect on average pay of an increase in how informative observables are about workers' skill into a non-negative instrumental component, reflecting increased surplus due to better matching of workers with tasks, and a perception-correcting component capturing how extra information diminishes the importance of prior misperceptions about the distribution of skills in the worker population. We sign the perception-correcting term: it is non-negative (non-positive) if the population was ex-ante under-perceived (over-perceived). We then consider the implications for pay gaps between equally-skilled populations that differ in information, perceptions, or both, and identify conditions under which improving information narrows pay gaps.</description>

      <title>Intensity-Efficient Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.04306v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a refinement of Pareto-efficient allocations for situations where, in addition to having ordinal preferences, agents also have ordinal intensities: they can make comparisons such as "I prefer a to b more than I prefer c to d", without necessarily being able to quantify them. A rank-based criterion for interpersonal comparisons of such ordinal intensities is introduced for this new analytical environment. Building on this, an allocation is defined to be intensity-efficient if it is Pareto-efficient with respect to the agents' preferences and also such that when another Pareto-efficient allocation assigns the same pairs of items to the same pairs of agents but in a "flipped" way, the former allocation assigns the commonly preferred item in every such pair to the agent who prefers it more. Conditions are established under which such Pareto-refining allocations exist. The potential usefulness of this theory in matching problems is illustrated with a quadratic-time extension of the Random Priority (RP) algorithm that returns an allocation which intensity-dominates RP's Pareto-efficient one.</description>

      <title>Pricing AI Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the market for AI models in which firms compete to provide accurate model predictions and consumers exhibit heterogeneous preferences for model accuracy. We develop a consumer-firm duopoly model to analyze how competition affects firms' incentives to improve model accuracy. Each firm aims to minimize its model's error, but this choice can often be suboptimal. Counterintuitively, we find that in a competitive market, firms that improve overall accuracy do not necessarily improve their profits. Rather, each firm's optimal decision is to invest further on the error dimension where it has a competitive advantage. By decomposing model errors into false positive and false negative rates, firms can reduce errors in each dimension through investments. Firms are strictly better off investing on their superior dimension and strictly worse off with investments on their inferior dimension. Profitable investments adversely affect consumers but increase overall welfare.</description>
