      <title>HENN: A Hierarchical Epsilon Net Navigation Graph for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical graph-based algorithms such as HNSW have achieved state-of-the-art performance for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search in practice, yet they often lack theoretical guarantees on query time or recall due to their heavy use of randomized heuristic constructions. Conversely, existing theoretically grounded structures are typically difficult to implement and struggle to scale in real-world scenarios. We propose the Hierarchical $\varepsilon$-Net Navigation Graph (HENN), a novel graph-based indexing structure for ANN search that combines strong theoretical guarantees with practical efficiency. Built upon the theory of $\varepsilon$-nets, HENN guarantees polylogarithmic worst-case query time while preserving high recall and incurring minimal implementation overhead. Moreover, we establish a probabilistic polylogarithmic query time bound for HNSW, providing theoretical insight into its empirical success. In contrast to these prior hierarchical methods that may degrade to linear query time under adversarial data, HENN maintains provable performance independent of the input data distribution. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HENN achieves faster query time while maintaining competitive recall on diverse data distributions, including adversarial inputs. These results underscore the effectiveness of HENN as a robust and scalable solution for fast and accurate nearest neighbor search.</description>

      <title>Corporate Needs You to Find the Difference: Revisiting Submodular and Supermodular Ratio Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing or maximizing the average value $ f(S)/|S| $ of a submodular or supermodular set function $ f: 2^V \to \mathbb{R} $ over non-empty subsets $ S \subseteq V $. This generalizes classical problems such as Densest Subgraph (DSG), Densest Supermodular Set (DSS), and Submodular Function Minimization (SFM). Motivated by recent applications, we introduce two broad formulations: Unrestricted Sparsest Submodular Set (USSS) and Unrestricted Densest Supermodular Set (UDSS), which allow for negative and non-monotone functions.
  We show that DSS, SFM, USSS, UDSS, and the Minimum Norm Point (MNP) problem are equivalent under strongly polynomial-time reductions, enabling algorithmic crossover. In particular, viewing these through the lens of the MNP in the base polyhedron, we connect Fujishige's theory with dense decomposition, and show that both Fujishige-Wolfe's algorithm and the heuristic \textsc{SuperGreedy++} act as universal solvers for all these problems, including sub-modular function minimization.
  Theoretically, we explain why \textsc{SuperGreedy++} is effective beyond DSS, including for tasks like submodular minimization and minimum $ s $-$ t $ cut. Empirically, we test several solvers, including the Fujishige-Wolfe algorithm on over 400 experiments across seven problem types and large-scale real/synthetic datasets. Surprisingly, general-purpose convex and flow-based methods outperform task-specific baselines, demonstrating that with the right framing, general optimization techniques can be both scalable and state-of-the-art for submodular and supermodular ratio problems.</description>

      <title>The Quasi-Polynomial Low-Degree Conjecture is False</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing body of work on proving hardness results for average-case estimation problems by bounding the low-degree advantage (LDA) - a quantitative estimate of the closeness of low-degree moments - between a null distribution and a related planted distribution. Such hardness results are now ubiquitous not only for foundational average-case problems but also central questions in statistics and cryptography. This line of work is supported by the low-degree conjecture of Hopkins, which postulates that a vanishing degree-$D$ LDA implies the absence of any noise-tolerant distinguishing algorithm with runtime $n^{\widetilde{O}(D)}$ whenever 1) the null distribution is product on $\{0,1\}^{\binom{n}{k}}$, and 2) the planted distribution is permutation invariant, that is, invariant under any relabeling $[n] \rightarrow [n]$.
  In this paper, we disprove this conjecture. Specifically, we show that for any fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $k\geq 2$, there is a permutation-invariant planted distribution on $\{0,1\}^{\binom{n}{k}}$ that has a vanishing degree-$n^{1-O(\varepsilon)}$ LDA with respect to the uniform distribution on $\{0,1\}^{\binom{n}{k}}$, yet the corresponding $\varepsilon$-noisy distinguishing problem can be solved in $n^{O(\log^{1/(k-1)}(n))}$ time. Our construction relies on algorithms for list-decoding for noisy polynomial interpolation in the high-error regime.
  We also give another construction of a pair of planted and (non-product) null distributions on $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with a vanishing $n^{\Omega(1)}$-degree LDA while the largest eigenvalue serves as an efficient noise-tolerant distinguisher.
  Our results suggest that while a vanishing LDA may still be interpreted as evidence of hardness, developing a theory of average-case complexity based on such heuristics requires a more careful approach.</description>

      <title>Improved Algorithms for Overlapping and Robust Clustering of Edge-Colored Hypergraphs: An LP-Based Combinatorial Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in both machine learning and data mining. Among various methods, edge-colored clustering (ECC) has emerged as a useful approach for handling categorical data. Given a hypergraph with (hyper)edges labeled by colors, ECC aims to assign vertex colors to minimize the number of edges where the vertex color differs from the edge's color. However, traditional ECC has inherent limitations, as it enforces a nonoverlapping and exhaustive clustering. To tackle these limitations, three versions of ECC have been studied: Local ECC and Global ECC, which allow overlapping clusters, and Robust ECC, which accounts for vertex outliers. For these problems, both linear programming (LP) rounding algorithms and greedy combinatorial algorithms have been proposed. While these LP-rounding algorithms provide high-quality solutions, they demand substantial computation time; the greedy algorithms, on the other hand, run very fast but often compromise solution quality. In this paper, we present an algorithmic framework that combines the strengths of LP with the computational efficiency of combinatorial algorithms. Both experimental and theoretical analyses show that our algorithms efficiently produce high-quality solutions for all three problems: Local, Global, and Robust ECC. We complement our algorithmic contributions with complexity-theoretic inapproximability results and integrality gap bounds, which suggest that significant theoretical improvements are unlikely. Our results also answer two open questions previously raised in the literature.</description>

      <title>Optimal Capacity Modification for Stable Matchings with Ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Hospitals/Residents (HR) problem in the presence of ties in preference lists. Among the three notions of stability, viz. weak, strong, and super stability, we focus on the notion of strong stability. Strong stability has many desirable properties, both theoretically and practically; however, its existence is not guaranteed. In this paper, our objective is to optimally increase the quotas of hospitals to ensure that a strongly stable matching exists in the modified instance. First, we show that if ties are allowed in residents' preference lists, it may not be possible to augment the hospital quotas to obtain an instance that admits a strongly stable matching. When residents' preference lists are strict, we explore two natural optimization criteria: (i) minimizing the total capacity increase across all hospitals (MINSUM) and (ii) minimizing the maximum capacity increase for any hospital (MINMAX). We show that the MINSUM problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm, whereas the MINMAX problem is NP-hard. We prove an analogue of the Rural Hospitals theorem for the MINSUM problem. When each hospital incurs a cost for a unit increase in its quota, the MINSUM problem becomes NP-hard, even for 0/1 costs. In fact, we show that the problem cannot be approximated to any multiplicative factor. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal MINSUM augmentation when a specified subset of edges is required to be included in the matching. We show that the MINMAX problem is NP-hard in general. When hospital preference lists have ties of length at most $\ell+1$, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that increases each hospital's quota by at most $\ell$. Amongst all instances obtained by at most $\ell$ augmentations per hospital, our algorithm produces a strongly stable matching that is best for residents.</description>

      <title>EFX Exists for Three Types of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding an envy-free allocation of indivisible goods among agents with additive valuations. We focus on the fairness notion of envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). A central open question in fair division is whether EFX allocations always exist for any number of agents. While EFX has been established for three agents [CGM24] and for any number of agents with at most two distinct valuations [Mah23], its existence in more general settings remains open.
  In this paper, we make significant progress by proving that EFX allocations exist for any number of agents when there are at most three distinct additive valuations. This result simultaneously generalizes both the three-agent case and the two-type case, settling an open question in the field (see [Mah23]).</description>

      <title>Online Bidding Algorithms with Strict Return on Spend (ROS) Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding problem under a strict return-on-spend constraint (ROSC) is considered, where an algorithm has to make decisions about how much to bid for an ad slot depending on the revealed value, and the hidden allocation and payment function that describes the probability of winning the ad-slot depending on its bid. The objective of an algorithm is to maximize the expected utility (product of ad value and probability of winning the ad slot) summed across all time slots subject to the total expected payment being less than the total expected utility, called the ROSC. A (surprising) impossibility result is derived that shows that no online algorithm can achieve a sub-linear regret even when the value, allocation and payment function are drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The problem is non-trivial even when the revealed value remains constant across time slots, and an algorithm with regret guarantee that is optimal up to logarithmic factor is derived.</description>

      <title>Streaming Attention Approximation via Discrepancy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success, but their high memory requirements present challenges for long-context token generation. In this paper we study the streaming complexity of attention approximation, a key computational primitive underlying token generation.
  Our main contribution is BalanceKV, a streaming algorithm for $\epsilon$-approximating attention computations based on geometric process for selecting a balanced collection of Key and Value tokens as per Banaszczyk's vector balancing theory. We complement our algorithm with space lower bounds for streaming attention computation. Besides strong theoretical guarantees, BalanceKV exhibits empirically validated performance improvements over existing methods, both for attention approximation and end-to-end performance on various long context benchmarks.</description>
