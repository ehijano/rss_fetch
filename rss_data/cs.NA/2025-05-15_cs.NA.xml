      <title>Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov with a globalization method for solving groundwater flow models of multi-layer aquifer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Jacobian free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method with a globalization scheme is introduced to solve large and complex nonlinear systems of equations that arise in groundwater flow models of multi-layer aquifer systems. We explore the advantages of the JFNK method relative to the Newton-Krylov (NK) method and identify the circumstances in which the JFNK method demonstrates computing efficiency. We perform the validation and efficiency of the JFNK method on various test cases involving an unconfined single-layer aquifer and a two-layer aquifer with both confined and unconfined conditions. The results are validated by the NK method. The JFNK method is incorporated in Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM), an integrated hydrologic model developed and maintained by California Department of Water Resources. We examine the determinacy of the JFNK's adaptability on practical models such as the California Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model (C2VSim).</description>

      <title>A Framework for Analysis of DEC Approximations to Hodge-Laplacian Problems using Generalized Whitney Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a framework for interpreting Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) numerical schemes in terms of Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC). We demonstrate the equivalence of cochains on primal and dual meshes with Whitney and generalized Whitney forms which allows us to analyze DEC approximations using tools from FEEC. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by rigorously proving convergence with rates for the Hodge-Laplacian problem in full $k$-form generality on well-centered meshes on contractible domains. We also provide numerical results illustrating optimality of our derived convergence rates. Moreover, we demonstrate how superconvergence phenomena can be explained in our framework with corresponding numerical results.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Modeling for First Order Hyperbolic Systems with Application to Multiparameter Acoustic Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveform inversion seeks to estimate an inaccessible heterogeneous medium from data gathered by sensors that emit probing signals and measure the generated waves. It is an inverse problem for a second order wave equation or a first order hyperbolic system, with the sensor excitation modeled as a forcing term and the heterogeneous medium described by unknown, spatially variable coefficients. The traditional ``full waveform inversion" (FWI) formulation estimates the unknown coefficients via minimization of the nonlinear, least squares data fitting objective function. For typical band-limited and high frequency data, this objective function has spurious local minima near and far from the true coefficients. Thus, FWI implemented with gradient based optimization algorithms may fail, even for good initial guesses. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to obtain a better behaved objective function for wave speed estimation, using data driven reduced order models (ROMs) that capture the propagation of pressure waves, governed by the classic second order wave equation. Here we introduce ROMs for vectorial waves, satisfying a general first order hyperbolic system. They are defined via Galerkin projection on the space spanned by the wave snapshots, evaluated on a uniform time grid with appropriately chosen time step. Our ROMs are data driven: They are computed in an efficient and non-iterative manner, from the sensor measurements, without knowledge of the medium and the snapshots. The ROM computation applies to any linear waves in lossless and non-dispersive media. For the inverse problem we focus attention on acoustic waves in a medium with unknown variable wave speed and density. We show that these can be determined via minimization of an objective function that uses a ROM based approximation of the vectorial wave field inside the inaccessible medium.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Stability of Discrete Exterior Calculus for the Hodge Laplace Problem in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence and stability of the discrete exterior calculus (DEC) solutions for the Hodge-Laplace problems in two dimensions for families of meshes that are non-degenerate Delaunay and shape regular. We do this by relating the DEC solutions to the lowest order finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) solutions. A Poincar\'e inequality and a discrete inf-sup condition for DEC are part of this proof. We also prove that under appropriate geometric conditions on the mesh the DEC and FEEC norms are equivalent. Only one side of the norm equivalence is needed for proving stability and convergence and this allows us to relax the conditions on the meshes.</description>

      <title>On a Modified Random Genetic Drift Model: Derivation and a Structure-Preserving Operator-Splitting Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental mathematical models for studying random genetic drift is the Kimura equation, derived as the large-population limit of the discrete Wright-Fisher model. However, due to the degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient, it is impossible to impose a suitable boundary condition that ensures the Kimura equation admits a classical solution while preserving biological significance. In this work, we propose a modified model for random genetic drift that admits classical solutions by modifying the domain of the Kimura equation from $(0, 1)$ to $(\delta, 1 - \delta)$ with $\delta$ being a small parameter, which allows us to impose a Robin-type boundary condition. By introducing two additional variables for the probabilities in the boundary region, we effectively capture the conservation of mass and the fixation dynamics in the original model. To numerically investigate the modified model, we develop a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian operator splitting scheme. The scheme first solves the flow map equation in the bulk region using a Lagrangian approach with a no-flux boundary condition, followed by handling the boundary dynamics in Eulerian coordinates. This hybrid scheme ensures mass conservation, maintains positivity, and preserves the first moment. Various numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and structure-preserving properties of the proposed scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the key qualitative features of the original Kimura equation, including the fixation behavior and the correct stationary distribution in the small-$\delta$ limit.</description>

      <title>Approximation of viscous transport and conservative equations with one sided Lipschitz velocity fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to investigate semi-Lagrangian approximation schemes on unstructured grids for viscous transport and conservative equations with measurable coefficients that satisfy a one-sided Lipschitz condition. To establish the convergence of the schemes, we exploit the characterization of the solution for these equations expressed in terms of measurable time-dependent viscosity solution and, respectively, duality solution. We supplement our theoretical analysis with various numerical examples to illustrate the features of the schemes.</description>

      <title>A federated Kaczmarz algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a federated algorithm for solving large linear systems that is inspired by the classic randomized Kaczmarz algorithm. We provide convergence guarantees of the proposed method, and as a corollary of our analysis, we provide a new proof for the convergence of the classic randomized Kaczmarz method. We demonstrate experimentally the behavior of our method when applied to related problems. For underdetermined systems, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be used for sparse approximation. For inconsistent systems, we demonstrate that our algorithm converges to a horizon of the least squares solution. Finally, we apply our algorithm to real data and show that it is consistent with the selection of Lasso, while still offering the computational advantages of the Kaczmarz framework and thresholding-based algorithms in the federated setting.</description>

      <title>Vertex-based auxiliary space multigrid method and its application to linear elasticity equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a vertex-based auxiliary space multigrid(V-ASMG) method as a preconditioner of the PCG method is proposed for solving the large sparse linear equations derived from the linear elasticity equations. The main key of such V-ASMG method lies in an auxiliary region-tree structure based on the geometrically regular subdivision. The computational complexity of building such a region-tree is $\mathcal{O}\left(q N\log_2 N\right)$, where $N$ is the number of the given original grid vertices and $q$ is the power of the ratio of the maximum distance $d_{max}$ to minimum distance $d_{min}$ between the given original grid vertices. The process of constructing the auxiliary region-tree is similar to the method in [17], but the selection of the representative points is changed. To be more specific, instead of choosing the barycenters, the correspondence between each grid layer is constructed based on the position relationship of the grid vertices. There are two advantages for this approach: the first is its simplicity, there is no need to deal with hanging points when building the auxiliary region-tree, and it is possible to construct the restriction/prolongation operator directly by using the bilinear interpolation function, and it is easy to be generalized to other problems as well, due to all the information we need is only the grid vertices; the second is its strong convergence, the corresponding relative residual can quickly converge to the given tolerance(It is taken to be $10^{-6}$ in this paper), thus obtaining the desired numerical solution. Two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments are given to verify the strong convergence of the proposed V-ASMG method as a preconditioner of the PCG method.</description>

      <title>Quasi-3D beam theory based on equilibrium stress definition and mixed element model for accurate analysis of functionally graded beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09127v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quasi-3D theory and the corresponding mixed beam element model to achieve accurate solutions for functionally graded beams. The key innovations include the development of equilibrium-based stress expressions, the modified cross-sectional stiffness matrix, and the mixed beam element model based on semi-analytical definition of internal force fields. In contrast to the conventional quasi-3D theory where stress expressions are derived from constitutive equations and geometric relations, the stress expressions in this study are derived from the differential equilibrium equations among stresses, ensuring strict adherence of stress solutions to equilibrium conditions. To incorporate the influence of equilibrium-derived stress distributions, the modified cross-sectional stiffness matrix is derived, enhancing the theoretical and practical feasibility of the beam model. For beam element construction, the mixed variational principle of two-field variables is employed, with generalized internal forces and generalized displacements regarded as two independent fields. Especially, semi-analytical internal force fields, which partially satisfy the differential equilibrium equations, are introduced to improve the element performance. Numerical examples are conducted to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed theory and beam element.</description>

      <title>Primal-dual splitting methods for phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfactants have important effects on the dynamics of droplets on solid surfaces, which has inspired many industrial applications. Phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines (PFS-MCL) has been employed to investigate the complex droplet dynamics with surfactants, while its numerical simulation remains challenging due to the coupling of gradient flows with respect to transport distances involving nonlinear and degenerate mobilities. We propose a novel structure-preserving variational scheme for PFS-MCL model with the dynamic boundary condition based on the minimizing movement scheme and optimal transport theory for Wasserstein gradient flows. The proposed scheme consists of a series of convex minimization problems and can be efficiently solved by our proposed primal-dual splitting method and its accelerated versions. By respecting the underlying PDE's variational structure with respect to the transport distance, the proposed scheme is proved to inherits the desirable properties including original energy dissipation, bound-preserving, and mass conservation. Through a suite of numerical simulations, we validate the performance of the proposed scheme and investigate the effects of surfactants on the droplet dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with constructing a second-order, invariant-domain preserving approximation of the compressible multi-species Euler equations where each species is modeled by an ideal gas equation of state. We give the full solution to the Riemann problem and derive its maximum wave speed. The maximum wave speed is used in constructing a first-order invariant-domain preserving approximation. We then extend the methodology to second-order accuracy and detail a convex limiting technique which is used for preserving the invariant domain. Finally, the numerical method is verified with analytical solutions and then validated with several benchmarks and laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Single-shot prediction of parametric partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Flexi-VAE, a data-driven framework for efficient single-shot forecasting of nonlinear parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), eliminating the need for iterative time-stepping while maintaining high accuracy and stability. Flexi-VAE incorporates a neural propagator that advances latent representations forward in time, aligning latent evolution with physical state reconstruction in a variational autoencoder setting. We evaluate two propagation strategies, the Direct Concatenation Propagator (DCP) and the Positional Encoding Propagator (PEP), and demonstrate, through representation-theoretic analysis, that DCP offers superior long-term generalization by fostering disentangled and physically meaningful latent spaces. Geometric diagnostics, including Jacobian spectral analysis, reveal that propagated latent states reside in regions of lower decoder sensitivity and more stable local geometry than those derived via direct encoding, enhancing robustness for long-horizon predictions. We validate Flexi-VAE on canonical PDE benchmarks, the 1D viscous Burgers equation and the 2D advection-diffusion equation, achieving accurate forecasts across wide parametric ranges. The model delivers over 50x CPU and 90x GPU speedups compared to autoencoder-LSTM baselines for large temporal shifts. These results position Flexi-VAE as a scalable and interpretable surrogate modeling tool for accelerating high-fidelity simulations in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other parametric PDE-driven applications, with extensibility to higher-dimensional and more complex systems.</description>

      <title>Derivative-free optimization is competitive for aerodynamic design optimization in moderate dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerodynamic design optimization is an important problem in aircraft design that depends on the interplay between a numerical optimizer and a high-fidelity flow physics solver. Derivative-based, first and (quasi) second order, optimization techniques are the de facto choice, particularly given the availability of the adjoint method and its ability to efficiently compute gradients at the cost of just one solution of the forward problem. However, implementation of the adjoint method requires careful mathematical treatment, and its sensitivity to changes in mesh quality limits widespread applicability. Derivative-free approaches are often overlooked for large scale optimization, citing their lack of scalability in higher dimensions and/or the lack of practical interest in globally optimal solutions that they often target. However, breaking free from an adjoint solver can be paradigm-shifting in broadening the applicability of aerodynamic design optimization. We provide a systematic benchmarking of a select sample of widely used derivative-based and derivative-free optimization algorithms on the design optimization of three canonical aerodynamic bodies, namely, the NACA0012 and RAE2822 airfoils, and the ONERAM6 wing. Our results demonstrate that derivative-free methods are competitive with derivative-based methods, while outperforming them consistently in the high-dimensional setting. These findings highlight the practical competitiveness of modern derivative-free strategies, offering a scalable and robust alternative for aerodynamic design optimization when adjoint-based gradients are unavailable or unreliable.</description>

      <title>Injectivity of boundary integral operator in direct-indirect mixed Burton-Miller equation for wave scattering problems with transmissive circular inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proves that the injectivity condition for the integral operator of the direct-indirect mixed Burton-Miller (BM) boundary integral equation (BIE) for Helmholtz transmission problems is identical to that for the ordinary BM BIE for Helmholtz transmission problems with a transmissive circular inclusion. Although some numerical methods based on the direct-indirect mixed BM BIE can be computed faster than the ordinary BM BIE, its well-posedness has been unclear. This study resolves a part of the well-posedness, namely the injectivity of the integral operator with a transmissive circular inclusion.</description>

      <title>Index Modulated Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing With Spread Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a new transmission waveform that has shown excellent performance in high-mobility environments, making it a sensible option for the next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate an energy-efficient index modulation scheme for AFDM by leveraging spread spectrum, referred to as IM-AFDM-SS, to combat the interference caused by the doubly dispersive channels. Specifically, the information bits are conveyed by the transmitted symbols as well as the indices of the selected spreading codes in our proposed IM-AFDM-SS scheme. To avoid extensive computations, we also develop a lowcomplexity maximal ratio combining (MRC) detector algorithm, which recovers the spreading codes first and demodulates the symbols afterwards. Moreover, an upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed IM-AFDM-SS system with maximumlikelihood (ML) detection is derived. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IM-AFDM-SS system over the classical AFDM spread spectrum (AFDM-SS) and the existing index modulated AFDM (IM-AFDM) systems.</description>

      <title>Piecewise rational rotation-minimizing motions via data stream interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a moving frame defined along a space curve is required to keep an axis aligned with the tangent direction of motion, the use of rotation-minimizing frames (RMF) avoids unnecessary rotations in the normal plane. The construction of rigid body motions using a specific subset of quintic curves with rational RMFs (RRMFs) is here considered. In particular, a novel geometric characterization of such subset enables the design of a local algorithm to interpolate an assigned stream of positions, together with an initial frame orientation. To achieve this, the translational part of the motion is described by a parametric $G^1$ spline curve whose segments are quintic RRMFs, with a globally continuous piecewise rational rotation-minimizing frame. A selection of numerical experiments illustrates the performances of the proposed method on synthetic and arbitrary data streams.</description>

      <title>Enhancing ZFP: A Statistical Approach to Understanding and Reducing Error Bias in a Lossy Floating-Point Compression Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amount of data generated and gathered in scientific simulations and data collection applications is continuously growing, putting mounting pressure on storage and bandwidth concerns. A means of reducing such issues is data compression; however, lossless data compression is typically ineffective when applied to floating-point data. Thus, users tend to apply a lossy data compressor, which allows for small deviations from the original data. It is essential to understand how the error from lossy compression impacts the accuracy of the data analytics. Thus, we must analyze not only the compression properties but the error as well. In this paper, we provide a statistical analysis of the error caused by ZFP compression, a state-of-the-art, lossy compression algorithm explicitly designed for floating-point data. We show that the error is indeed biased and propose simple modifications to the algorithm to neutralize the bias and further reduce the resulting error.</description>

      <title>Trefftz Discontinuous Galerkin approximation of an acoustic waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modified Trefftz Discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) method for approximating a time-harmonic acoustic scattering problem in an infinitely elongated waveguide. In the waveguide we suppose there is a bounded, penetrable and possibly absorbing scatterer. The classical TDG is not applicable to this important case. Novel features of our modified TDG method are that it is applicable when the scatterer is absorbing, and it uses a stable treatment of the asymptotic radiation condition for the scattered field. For the modified TDG, we prove $h$ and $p$-convergence in the $L^2$ norm. The theoretical results are verified numerically for a discretization based on plane waves (that may be evanescent in the scatterer).</description>

      <title>Exploring forms of the moist shallow water equations using a new compatible finite element discretisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moist shallow water equations offer a promising route for advancing understanding of the coupling of physical parametrisations and dynamics in numerical atmospheric models, an issue known as 'physics-dynamics coupling'. Without moist physics, the traditional shallow water equations are a simplified form of the atmospheric equations of motion and so are computationally cheap, but retain many relevant dynamical features of the atmosphere. Introducing physics into the shallow water model in the form of moisture provides a tool to experiment with numerical techniques for physics-dynamics coupling in a simple dynamical model. In this paper, we compare some of the different moist shallow water models by writing them in a general formulation. The general formulation encompasses three existing forms of the moist shallow water equations and also a fourth, previously unexplored formulation. The equations are coupled to a three-state moist physics scheme that interacts with the resolved flow through source terms and produces two-way physics-dynamics feedback. We present a new compatible finite element discretisation of the equations and apply it to the different formulations of the moist shallow water equations in three test cases. The results show that the models capture generation of cloud and rain and physics-dynamics interactions, and demonstrate some differences between moist shallow water formulations and the implications of these different modelling choices.</description>

      <title>A Fully Adaptive Radau Method for the Efficient Solution of Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations at Low Tolerances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radau IIA methods, specifically the adaptive order Radau method in Fortran due to Hairer, are known to be state-of-the-art for the high-accuracy solution of highly stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, the traditional implementation was specialized to a specific range of tolerance, in particular only supporting 5th, 9th, and 13th order versions of the tableau and only derived in double precision floating point, thus limiting the ability to be truly general purpose for high fidelity scenarios. To alleviate these constraints, we implement an adaptive-time adaptive-order Radau method which can derive the coefficients for the Radau IIA embedded tableau to any order on the fly to any precision. Additionally, our Julia-based implementation includes many modernizations to improve performance, including improvements to the order adaptation scheme and improved linear algebra integrations. In a head-to-head benchmark against the classic Fortran implementation, we demonstrate our implementation is approximately 2x across a range of stiff ODEs. We benchmark our algorithm against several well-reputed numerical integrators for stiff ODEs and find state-of-the-art performance on several test problems, with a 1.5-times speed-up over common numerical integrators for stiff ODEs when low error tolerance is required. The newly implemented method is distributed in open source software for free usage on stiff ODEs.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limits of the Reactive Affine Shaker Algorithm to Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) for the minimization of expensive functions of continuous variables uses all the knowledge acquired from previous samples (${\boldsymbol x}_i$ and $f({\boldsymbol x}_i)$ values) to build a surrogate model based on Gaussian processes. The surrogate is then exploited to define the next point to sample, through a careful balance of exploration and exploitation. Initially intended for low-dimensional spaces, BO has recently been modified and used also for very large-dimensional spaces (up to about one thousand dimensions).
  In this paper we consider a much simpler algorithm, called "Reactive Affine Shaker" (RAS). The next sample is always generated with a uniform probability distribution inside a parallelepiped (the "box"). At each iteration, the form of the box is adapted during the search through an affine transformation, based only on the point $\boldsymbol x$ position and on the success or failure in improving the function. The function values are therefore not used directly to modify the search area and to generate the next sample. The entire dimensionality is kept (no active subspaces).
  Despite its extreme simplicity and its use of only stochastic local search, surprisingly the produced results are comparable to and not too far from the state-of-the-art results of high-dimensional versions of BO, although with some more function evaluations.
  An ablation study and an analysis of probability distribution of directions (improving steps and prevailing box orientation) in very large-dimensional spaces are conducted to understand more about the behavior of RAS and to assess the relative importance of the algorithmic building blocks for the final results.</description>

      <title>A Modified Hermite Radial Basis Function for Accurate Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate interpolation of functions and derivatives is crucial in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The Radial Basis Function (RBF) method has become an extremely popular and robust approach for interpolation on scattered data. Hermite Radial Basis Function (HRBF) methods are an extension of the RBF and improve the overall accuracy by incorporating both function and derivative information. Unfortunately, the use of infinitely smooth kernels, such as the Gaussian, suffers from ill-conditioning at low to moderate shape parameters. This work proposes a Modified HRBF (MHRBF) method that introduces an additional polynomial term to balance kernel behavior, improving accuracy while maintaining or lowering computational cost. The numerical results demonstrate that MHRBF achieves lower errors with fewer unknowns compared to the original HRBF, making it a robust alternative for stable and accurate RBF-based interpolation.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic preserving scheme satisfying entropy stability for the barotropic Euler system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study structure-preserving numerical methods for low Mach number barotropic Euler equations. Besides their asymptotic preserving properties that are crucial in order to obtain uniformly consistent and stable approximations of the Euler equations in their singular limit as the Mach number approaches zero, our aim is also to preserve discrete entropy stability. Suitable acoustic/advection splitting approach combined with time implicit-explicit approximations are used to achieve the asymptotic preserving property. The entropy stability of different space discretisation strategies is studied for different values of Mach number and is validated by the numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Improving Data Fidelity via Diffusion Model-based Correction and Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified diffusion model-based correction and super-resolution method to enhance the fidelity and resolution of diverse low-quality data through a two-step pipeline. First, the correction step employs a novel enhanced stochastic differential editing technique based on an imbalanced perturbation and denoising process, ensuring robust and effective bias correction at the low-resolution level. The robustness and effectiveness of this approach are validated theoretically and experimentally. Next, the super-resolution step leverages cascaded conditional diffusion models to iteratively refine the corrected data to high-resolution. Numerical experiments on three PDE problems and a climate dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances low-fidelity, low-resolution data by correcting numerical errors and noise while simultaneously improving resolution to recover fine-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>
