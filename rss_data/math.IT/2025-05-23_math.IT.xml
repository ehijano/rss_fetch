      <title>Directional Sparsity Based Statistical Channel Estimation for 6D Movable Antenna Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative and transformative technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting the 3D positions and 3D rotations of antennas/surfaces (sub-arrays) based on the channel spatial distribution. For optimization of the antenna positions and rotations, the acquisition of statistical channel state information (CSI) is essential for 6DMA systems. In this paper, we unveil for the first time a new \textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of the 6DMA channels between the base station (BS) and the distributed users, where each user has significant channel gains only with a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from the user. By exploiting this property, a covariance-based algorithm is proposed for estimating the statistical CSI in terms of the average channel power at a small number of 6DMA positions and rotations. Based on such limited channel power estimation, the average channel powers for all possible 6DMA positions and rotations in the BS movement region are reconstructed by further estimating the multi-path average power and direction-of-arrival (DOA) vectors of all users. Simulation results show that the proposed directional sparsity-based algorithm can achieve higher channel power estimation accuracy than existing benchmark schemes, while requiring a lower pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Age-Energy Analysis in Multi-Source Systems with Wake-up Control and Packet Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on real-time mobile applications, such as news updates and weather forecast. In these applications, data freshness is of significant importance, which can be measured by age-of-synchronization (AoS). At the same time, the reduction of carbon emission is increasingly required by the communication operators. Thus, how to reduce energy consumption while keeping the data fresh becomes a matter of concern. In this paper, we study the age-energy trade-off in a multi-source single-server system, where the server can turn to sleep mode to save energy. We adopt the stochastic hybrid system (SHS) method to analyze the average AoS and power consumption with three wake-up policies including N-policy, single-sleep policy and multi-sleep policy, and three packet preemption strategies, including Last-Come-First-Serve with preemption-in-Service (LCFS-S), LCFS with preemption-only-in-Waiting (LCFS-W), and LCFS with preemption-and-Queueing (LCFS-Q). The trade-off performance is analyzed via both closed-form expressions and numerical simulations. It is found that N-policy attains the best trade-off performance among all three sleep policies. Among packet management strategies, LCFS-S is suitable for scenarios with high requirements on energy saving and small arrival rate difference between sources. LCFS-Q is suitable for scenarios with high requirements on information freshness and large arrival rate difference between sources.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS) is a new promising IRS architecture for which the reflection matrix is not limited to the diagonal structure as for conventional IRS. In this paper, we study a BD-IRS aided uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where sensing is performed in a device-based manner. Specifically, we aim to estimate the unknown and random location of an active target based on its uplink probing signals sent to a multi-antenna base station (BS) as well as the known prior distribution information of the target's location. Multiple communication users also simultaneously send uplink signals, resulting in a challenging mutual interference issue between sensing and communication. We first characterize the sensing performance metric by deriving the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) when prior information is available. Then, we formulate a BD-IRS reflection matrix optimization problem to maximize the minimum expected achievable rate among the multiple users subject to a constraint on the PCRB as well as the lossless and reciprocal constraints on the BD-IRS reflection matrix. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this problem, we propose a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm which can find a high-quality suboptimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. In addition, we propose and optimize a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based scheme which removes the sensing-communication mutual interference. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed designs and provide useful design insights.</description>

      <title>Base Station Placement Optimization for Networked Sensing Exploiting Target Location Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a networked sensing system with multiple base stations (BSs), which collaboratively sense the unknown and random three-dimensional (3D) location of a target based on the target-reflected echo signals received at the BSs. Considering a practical scenario where the target location distribution is known a priori for exploitation, we aim to design the placement of the multiple BSs to optimize the networked sensing performance. Firstly, we characterize the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) in sensing the target's 3D location. Despite its complex form under networked sensing, we derive its closed-form expression in terms of the BS locations. Next, we formulate the BS placement optimization problem to minimize the sensing PCRB, which is non-convex and difficult to solve. By leveraging a series of equivalent transformations and the iterative inner approximation method, we devise an algorithm with polynomial-time complexity which is guaranteed to converge to a solution satisfying the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed placement design significantly outperforms various benchmark designs.</description>

      <title>Cooperative NOMA Meets Emerging Technologies: A Survey for Next-Generation Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging demands of sixth-generation wireless networks, such as ultra-connectivity, native intelligence, and cross-domain convergence, are bringing renewed focus to cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) as a fundamental enabler of scalable, efficient, and intelligent communication systems. C-NOMA builds on the core benefits of NOMA by leveraging user cooperation and relay strategies to enhance spectral efficiency, coverage, and energy performance. This article presents a unified and forward-looking survey on the integration of C-NOMA with key enabling technologies, including radio frequency energy harvesting, cognitive radio networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, space-air-ground integrated networks, and integrated sensing and communication-assisted semantic communication. Foundational principles and relaying protocols are first introduced to establish the technical relevance of C-NOMA. Then, a focused investigation is conducted into protocol-level synergies, architectural models, and deployment strategies across these technologies. Beyond integration, this article emphasizes the orchestration of C-NOMA across future application domains such as digital twins, extended reality, and e-health. In addition, it provides an extensive and in-depth review of recent literature, categorized by relaying schemes, system models, performance metrics, and optimization paradigms, including model-based, heuristic, and AI-driven approaches. Finally, open challenges and future research directions are outlined, spanning standardization, security, and cross-layer design, positioning C-NOMA as a key pillar of intelligent next-generation network architectures.</description>

      <title>Half-Marker Codes for Deletion Channels with Applications in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA storage systems face significant challenges, including insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) errors. Therefore, designing effective synchronization codes, i.e., codes capable of correcting IDS errors, is essential for DNA storage systems. Marker codes are a favorable choice for this purpose. In this paper, we extend the notion of marker codes by making the following key observation. Since each DNA base is equivalent to a 2-bit storage unit, one bit can be reserved for synchronization, while the other is dedicated to data transmission. Using this observation, we propose a new class of marker codes, which we refer to as half-marker codes. We demonstrate that this extension has the potential to significantly increase the mutual information between the input symbols and the soft outputs of an IDS channel modeling a DNA storage system. Specifically, through examples, we show that when concatenated with an outer error-correcting code, half-marker codes outperform standard marker codes and significantly reduce the end-to-end bit error rate of the system.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Network for Optimal User Association in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increased 5G deployments, network densification is higher than ever to support the exponentially high throughput requirements. However, this has meant a significant increase in energy consumption, leading to higher operational expenditure (OpEx) for network operators creating an acute need for improvements in network energy savings (NES). A key determinant of operational efficacy in cellular networks is the user association (UA) policy, as it affects critical aspects like spectral efficiency, load balancing etc. and therefore impacts the overall energy consumption of the network directly. Furthermore, with cellular network topologies lending themselves well to graphical abstractions, use of graphs in network optimization has gained significant prominence. In this work, we propose and analyze a graphical abstraction based optimization for UA in cellular networks to improve NES by determining when energy saving features like cell switch off can be activated. A comparison with legacy approaches establishes the superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Handover Criterion for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks (LAWNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, the demand for cellular-enabled low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) is rising significantly. The three-dimensional mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will lead to frequent handovers (HOs) in cellular networks, while traditional reference signal received power (RSRP)-based criteria may fail to capture the dynamic environment, causing redundant HOs or HO failures. To address this issue and motivated by the underutilization of sensing information in conventional HO mechanisms, we propose a novel HO activation criterion for UAV systems that integrates both sensing parameters provided by integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signals and RSRP. First, we construct an ISAC signal model tailored for low-altitude scenarios and derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for sensing distance estimation. Subsequently, we propose a novel joint HO criterion that extends the conventional RSRP-based method by integrating sensing information from ISAC signals, enabling more reliable HOs in dynamic UAV environments. Simulation results show that the joint HO criterion outperforms the baseline RSRP-based criterion under different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensing pilot ratio conditions. Particularly, when SNR is greater than 0dB and the sensing pilot ratio is 20%, the proposed joint HO criterion reduces the average HO region length by 49.97% and improves the activation probability by 76.31%.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication and Sensing: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, including fluid antenna systems (FAS) and movable antennas (MA), have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Rotatable antenna (RA) is an emerging technology that offers significant potential to enhance wireless communication and sensing performance by flexibly adjusting the boresight of directional antennas. Specifically, RA can flexibly reconfigure its boresight direction via mechanical or electronic means, thereby improving communication channel conditions and/or enhancing sensing resolution and range. In this article, we first provide an overview of RA, including its promising applications, hardware architectures, and radiation pattern characterization. We then illustrate how RA improves communication performance through interference mitigation, spatial multiplexing, and flexible beamforming, as well as enhances sensing capabilities in terms of coverage, resolution, and multi-target/dimensional sensing. Furthermore, we discuss key design challenges in RA systems, including rotational scanning scheduling, channel estimation/sensing, boresight optimization, and RA configuration. Finally, both experimental and simulation results are provided to validate the performance gains achieved by RA for both communication and sensing. Leveraging its unique capabilities in flexible antenna/array rotation to adapt to various communication/sensing requirements and channel conditions, RA is poised to become a key enabler of future intelligent, resilient, and agile wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the NVIDIA Sionna Research Kit, a GPU-accelerated research platform for developing and testing AI/ML algorithms in 5G NR cellular networks. Powered by the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, the platform leverages accelerated computing to deliver high throughput and real-time signal processing, while offering the flexibility of a software-defined stack. Built on OpenAirInterface (OAI), it unlocks a broad range of research opportunities. These include developing 5G NR and ORAN compliant algorithms, collecting real-world data for AI/ML training, and rapidly deploying innovative solutions in a very affordable testbed. Additionally, AI/ML hardware acceleration promotes the exploration of use cases in edge computing and AI radio access networks (AI-RAN). To demonstrate the capabilities, we deploy a real-time neural receiver - trained with NVIDIA Sionna and using the NVIDIA TensorRT library for inference - in a 5G NR cellular network using commercial user equipment. The code examples will be made publicly available, enabling researchers to adopt and extend the platform for their own projects.</description>

      <title>Beamforming-Codebook-Aware Channel Knowledge Map Construction for Multi-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a crucial technology for next-generation communication, enabling the construction of high-fidelity mappings between spatial environments and channel parameters via electromagnetic information analysis. Traditional CKM construction methods like ray tracing are computationally intensive. Recent studies utilizing neural networks (NNs) have achieved efficient CKM generation with reduced computational complexity and real-time processing capabilities. Nevertheless, existing research predominantly focuses on single-antenna systems, failing to address the beamforming requirements inherent to MIMO configurations. Given that appropriate precoding vector selection in MIMO systems can substantially enhance user communication rates, this paper presents a TransUNet-based framework for constructing CKM, which effectively incorporates discrete Fourier transform (DFT) precoding vectors. The proposed architecture combines a UNet backbone for multiscale feature extraction with a Transformer module to capture global dependencies among encoded linear vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning (DL) approaches, yielding a 17\% improvement in RMSE compared to RadioWNet. The code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/github-whh/TransUNet.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling, Architectures, System Design and Optimization, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Written by its inventors, this first tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RISs) provides the readers with the basics and fundamental tools necessary to appreciate, understand, and contribute to this emerging and disruptive technology. Conventional (Diagonal) RISs (D-RISs) are characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix $\mathbf{\Theta}$ such that the wave manipulation flexibility of D-RIS is extremely limited. In contrast, BD-RIS refers to a novel and general framework for RIS where its scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal (hence, the ``beyond-diagonal'' terminology) and consequently, all entries of $\mathbf{\Theta}$ can potentially help shaping waves for much higher manipulation flexibility. This physically means that BD-RIS can artificially engineer and reconfigure coupling across elements of the surface thanks to inter-element reconfigurable components which allow waves absorbed by one element to flow through other elements. Consequently, BD-RIS opens the door to more general and versatile intelligent surfaces that subsumes existing RIS architectures as special cases. In this tutorial, we share all the secret sauce to model, design, and optimize BD-RIS and make BD-RIS transformative in many different applications. Topics discussed include physics-consistent and multi-port network-aided modeling; transmitting, reflecting, hybrid, and multi-sector mode analysis; reciprocal and non-reciprocal architecture designs and optimal performance-complexity Pareto frontier of BD-RIS; signal processing, optimization, and channel estimation for BD-RIS; hardware impairments (discrete-value impedance and admittance, lossy interconnections and components, wideband effects, mutual coupling) of BD-RIS; benefits and applications of BD-RIS in communications, sensing, power transfer.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecked Transformers: Periodic KV Cache Abstraction for Generalised Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning (extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods; whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling alone cannot overcome.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an extension of the Construction $\pi_A$ lattices proposed in \cite{huang2017construction}, to Hurwitz quaternion integers. This construction is provided by using an isomorphism from a version of the Chinese remainder theorem applied to maximal orders in contrast to natural orders in prior works. Exploiting this map, we analyze the performance of the resulting multilevel lattice codes, highlight via computer simulations their notably reduced computational complexity provided by the multistage decoding. Moreover it is shown that this construction effectively attain the Poltyrev-limit.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Multi-Stage Algorithm and Bounds for Group Testing with Prior Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10018v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-stage algorithm for non-adaptive Group Testing (GT) with general correlated prior statistics. The proposed solution can be applied to any correlated statistical prior represented in trellis, e.g., finite state machines and Markov processes. We introduce a variation of List Viterbi Algorithm (LVA) to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than objectives, which efficiently gains from the correlated prior statistics structure. We also provide a sufficiency bound to the number of pooled tests required by any Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decoder with an arbitrary correlation between infected items. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Stage GT (MSGT) algorithm can obtain the optimal MAP performance with feasible complexity in practical regimes, such as with COVID-19 and sparse signal recovery applications, and reduce in the scenarios tested the number of pooled tests by at least 25% compared to existing classical low complexity GT algorithms. Moreover, we analytically characterize the complexity of the proposed MSGT algorithm that guarantees its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Blank Space: Adaptive Causal Coding for Streaming Communications Over Multi-Hop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Blank Space AC-RLNC (BS), a novel Adaptive and Causal Network Coding (AC-RLNC) solution designed to mitigate the triplet trade-off between throughput-delay-efficiency in multi-hop networks. BS leverages the network's physical limitations considering the bottleneck from each node to the destination. In particular, BS introduces a light-computational re-encoding algorithm, called Network AC-RLNC (NET), implemented independently at intermediate nodes. NET adaptively adjusts the Forward Error Correction (FEC) rates and schedules idle periods. It incorporates two distinct suspension mechanisms: 1) Blank Space Period, accounting for the forward-channels bottleneck, and 2) No-New No-FEC approach, based on data availability. The experimental results achieve significant improvements in resource efficiency, demonstrating a 20% reduction in channel usage compared to baseline RLNC solutions. Notably, these efficiency gains are achieved while maintaining competitive throughput and delay performance, ensuring improved resource utilization does not compromise network performance.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with Cyclic User Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is motivated by federated learning (FL) where a cloud server aims to compute an averaged model (i.e., weights of deep neural networks) of the locally-trained models of numerous clients, while adhering to data security requirements. Hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) extends this concept to a three-layer network, where clustered users communicate with the server through an intermediate layer of relays. In HSA, beyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure that the relays remain oblivious to the users' inputs (an abstraction of the local models in FL). Existing study on HSA assumes that each user is associated with only one relay, limiting opportunities for coding across inter-cluster users to achieve efficient communication and key generation. In this paper, we consider HSA with a cyclic association pattern where each user is connected to $B$ consecutive relays in a wrap-around manner. We propose an efficient aggregation scheme which includes a message design for the inputs inspired by gradient coding-a well-known technique for efficient communication in distributed computing-along with a highly nontrivial security key design. We also derive novel converse bounds on the minimum achievable communication and key rates using information-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $k$-hash distances and rates of linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we bound the rate of linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ with the property that any $k\leq q$ codewords are all simultaneously distinct in at least $d_k$ coordinates. For the particular case $d_k=1$, this leads to bounds on the rate of linear $q$-ary $k$-hash codes which generalize, with a simpler proof, results recently obtained for the case $q=k=3$ by Pohoata and Zakharov and by Bishnoi, D'haeseleer, Gijswijt and Potukuchi. We finally discuss some related open problems on the list-decoding zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels.</description>

      <title>Estimation of discrete distributions in relative entropy, and the deviations of the missing mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a distribution over a finite alphabet from an i.i.d. sample, with accuracy measured in relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). While optimal expected risk bounds are known, high-probability guarantees remain less well-understood. First, we analyze the classical Laplace (add-one) estimator, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds on its performance and showing its optimality among confidence-independent estimators. We then characterize the minimax-optimal high-probability risk, which is attained via a simple confidence-dependent smoothing technique. Interestingly, the optimal non-asymptotic risk exhibits an additional logarithmic factor over the ideal asymptotic risk. Next, motivated by scenarios where the alphabet exceeds the sample size, we investigate methods that adapt to the sparsity of the distribution at hand. We introduce an estimator using data-dependent smoothing, for which we establish a high-probability risk bound depending on two effective sparsity parameters. As part of the analysis, we also derive a sharp high-probability upper bound on the missing mass.</description>
