      <title>Adaptive combinations of tail-risk forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to meet the increasingly stringent global standards of banking management and regulation, several methods have been proposed in the literature for forecasting tail risk measures such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). However, regardless of the approach used, there are several sources of uncertainty, including model specifications, data-related issues and the estimation procedure, which can significantly affect the accuracy of VaR and ES measures. Aiming to mitigate the influence of these sources of uncertainty and improve the predictive performance of individual models, we propose novel forecast combination strategies based on the Model Confidence Set (MCS). In particular, consistent joint VaR and ES loss functions within the MCS framework are used to adaptively combine forecasts generated by a wide range of parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric models. Our results reveal that the proposed combined predictors provide a suitable alternative for forecasting risk measures, passing the usual backtests, entering the set of superior models of the MCS, and usually exhibiting lower standard deviations than other model specifications.</description>

      <title>Model Aggregation for Risk Evaluation and Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for prudent risk evaluation based on stochastic dominance, which will be called the model aggregation (MA) approach. In contrast to the classic worst-case risk (WR) approach, the MA approach produces not only a robust value of risk evaluation but also a robust distributional model, independent of any specific risk measure. The MA risk evaluation can be computed through explicit formulas in the lattice theory of stochastic dominance, and under some standard assumptions, the MA robust optimization admits a convex-program reformulation. The MA approach for Wasserstein and mean-variance uncertainty sets admits explicit formulas for the obtained robust models. Via an equivalence property between the MA and the WR approaches, new axiomatic characterizations are obtained for the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES, also known as CVaR). The new approach is illustrated with various risk measures and examples from portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides the first and second order derivatives of any risk measures, including VaR and ES for continuous and discrete portfolio loss random variable variables. Also, we give asymptotic results of the first and second order conditional moments for heavy-tailed portfolio loss random variable.</description>

      <title>Risk Aware Benchmarking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for benchmarking socio-technical risks of foundation models with quantified statistical significance. Our approach hinges on a new statistical relative testing based on first and second order stochastic dominance of real random variables. We show that the second order statistics in this test are linked to mean-risk models commonly used in econometrics and mathematical finance to balance risk and utility when choosing between alternatives. Using this framework, we formally develop a risk-aware approach for foundation model selection given guardrails quantified by specified metrics. Inspired by portfolio optimization and selection theory in mathematical finance, we define a metrics portfolio for each model as a means to aggregate a collection of metrics, and perform model selection based on the stochastic dominance of these portfolios. The statistical significance of our tests is backed theoretically by an asymptotic analysis via central limit theorems instantiated in practice via a bootstrap variance estimate. We use our framework to compare various large language models regarding risks related to drifting from instructions and outputting toxic content.</description>
