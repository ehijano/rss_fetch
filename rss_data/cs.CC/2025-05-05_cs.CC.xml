      <title>More efficient sifting for grid norms, and applications to multiparty communication complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the techniques behind the recent progress on the 3-term arithmetic progression problem [KM'23], Kelley, Lovett, and Meka [KLM'24] constructed the first explicit 3-player function $f:[N]^3 \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that demonstrates a strong separation between randomized and (non-)deterministic NOF communication complexity. Specifically, their hard function can be solved by a randomized protocol sending $O(1)$ bits, but requires $\Omega(\log^{1/3}(N))$ bits of communication with a deterministic (or non-deterministic) protocol.
  We show a stronger $\Omega(\log^{1/2}(N))$ lower bound for their construction. To achieve this, the key technical advancement is an improvement to the sifting argument for grid norms of (somewhat dense) bipartite graphs. In addition to quantitative improvement, we qualitatively improve over [KLM'24] by relaxing the hardness condition: while [KLM'24] proved their lower bound for any function $f$ that satisfies a strong two-sided pseudorandom condition, we show that a weak one-sided condition suffices. This is achieved by a new structural result for cylinder intersections (or, in graph-theoretic language, the set of triangles induced from a tripartite graph), showing that any small cylinder intersection can be efficiently covered by a sum of simple ``slice'' functions.</description>

      <title>On optimal distinguishers for Planted Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a distinguishing problem, the input is a sample drawn from one of two distributions and the algorithm is tasked with identifying the source distribution. The performance of a distinguishing algorithm is measured by its advantage, i.e., its incremental probability of success over a random guess. A classic example of a distinguishing problem is the Planted Clique problem, where the input is a graph sampled from either $G(n,1/2)$ -- the standard Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model, or $G(n,1/2,k)$ -- the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model with a clique planted on a random subset of $k$ vertices. The Planted Clique Hypothesis asserts that efficient algorithms cannot achieve advantage better than some absolute constant, say $1/4$, whenever $k=n^{1/2-\Omega(1)}$. In this work, we aim to precisely understand the optimal distinguishing advantage achievable by efficient algorithms on Planted Clique. We show the following results under the Planted Clique hypothesis:
  1. Optimality of low-degree polynomials: The optimal advantage achievable by any efficient algorithm is bounded by the low-degree advantage, which is the advantage achievable by low-degree polynomials of the input. The low-degree advantage is roughly $k^2/(\sqrt{2}n)$. Conversely, a simple edge-counting algorithm achieves advantage $k^2/(\sqrt{\pi}n)$, showing that our bound is tight up to a small constant factor.
  2. Harder planted distributions: There is an efficiently sampleable distribution $\mathcal{P}^*$ supported on graphs containing $k$-cliques such that no efficient algorithm can distinguish $\mathcal{P}^*$ from $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $n^{-d}$ for an arbitrarily large constant $d$. In other words, there exist alternate planted distributions that are much harder than $G(n,1/2,k)$.</description>

      <title>PLS-completeness of string permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitstrings can be permuted via permutations and compared via the lexicographic order. In this paper we study the complexity of finding a minimum of a bitstring via given permutations. As a global optima is known to be NP-complete, we study the local optima via the class PLS and show hardness for PLS. Additionally, we show that even for one permutation the global optimization is NP-complete and give a formula that has these permutation as symmetries. This answers an open question inspired from Kolodziejczyk and Thapen and stated at the SAT and interactions seminar in Dagstuhl.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Gaussian Graphical Models Defined on Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two Gaussian graphical models defined on complete bipartite graphs. We show that the determinants of the precision matrices associated with the models are equal up to scale, where the scale factor only depends on model parameters. In this context, we will introduce a notion of ``equivalence" between the two Gaussian graphical models. This equivalence has two key applications: first, it can significantly reduce the complexity of computing the exact value of the determinant, and second, it enables the derivation of closed-form expressions for the determinants in certain special cases.</description>

      <title>On a Hierarchy of Spectral Invariants for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04391v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of graph invariants that naturally extends the spectral invariants defined by F\"urer (Lin. Alg. Appl. 2010) based on the angles formed by the set of standard basis vectors and their projections onto eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix. We provide a purely combinatorial characterization of this hierarchy in terms of the walk counts. This allows us to give a complete answer to F\"urer's question about the strength of his invariants in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs in comparison to the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, extending the recent work of Rattan and Seppelt (SODA 2023). As another application of the characterization, we prove that almost all graphs are determined up to isomorphism in terms of the spectrum and the angles, which is of interest in view of the long-standing open problem whether almost all graphs are determined by their eigenvalues alone. Finally, we describe the exact relationship between the hierarchy and the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms for small dimensions, as also some other important spectral characteristics of a graph such as the generalized and the main spectra.</description>

      <title>Delta-modular ILP Problems of Bounded Codimension, Discrepancy, and Convolution (new version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $k,n \geq 0$ and a cost vector $c \in Z^n$, we study two fundamental integer linear programming (ILP) problems: \[
  \text{(Standard Form)} \quad \max\bigl\{c^\top x \colon Ax = b,\ x \in Z^n_{\geq 0}\bigr\} \text{ with } A \in Z^{k \times n}, \text{rank}(A) = k, b \in Z^k, \] \[
  \text{(Canonical Form)} \quad \max\bigl\{c^\top x \colon Ax \leq b,\ x \in Z^n\bigr\} \text{ with } A \in Z^{(n+k) \times n}, \text{rank}(A) = n, b \in Z^{n+k}. \] We present improved algorithms for both problems and their feasibility versions, parameterized by $k$ and $\Delta$, where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $\text{rank}(A) \times \text{rank}(A)$ subdeterminants of $A$. Our main complexity results, stated in terms of required arithmetic operations, are: \[ \text{Optimization:}\quad O(\log k)^{2k} \cdot \Delta^2 / 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log \Delta})} + 2^{O(k)} \cdot \text{poly}(\varphi), \] \[ \text{Feasibility:} \quad O(\log k)^k \cdot \Delta \cdot (\log \Delta)^3 + 2^{O(k)} \cdot \text{poly}(\varphi), \] where $\varphi$ represents the input size measured by the bit-encoding length of $(A,b,c)$. We also examine several special cases when $k \in \{0,1\}$, which have important applications in: expected computational complexity of ILP with varying right-hand side $b$, ILP problems with generic constraint matrices, ILP problems on simplices. Our results yield improved complexity bounds for these specific scenarios.
  As independent contributions, we present: An $n^2/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$-time algorithm for the tropical convolution problem on sequences indexed by elements of a finite Abelian group of order $n$; A complete and self-contained error analysis of the generalized DFT over Abelian groups in the Word-RAM model.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Parameterized by Cluster Vertex Deletion Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $b$, Bandwidth asks whether there exists a bijection $\pi$ from $V(G)$ to $\{1, \ldots, |V(G)|\}$ such that $\max_{\{u, v \} \in E(G)} | \pi(u) - \pi(v) | \leq b$. This is a classical NP-complete problem, known to remain NP-complete even on very restricted classes of graphs, such as trees of maximum degree 3 and caterpillars of hair length 3. In the realm of parameterized complexity, these results imply that the problem remains NP-hard on graphs of bounded pathwidth, while it is additionally known to be W[1]-hard when parameterized by the tree-depth of the input graph. In contrast, the problem does become FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number. In this paper we make progress in understanding the parameterized (in)tractability of Bandwidth. We first show that it is FPT when parameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number cvd plus the clique number $\omega$, thus significantly strengthening the previously mentioned result for vertex cover number. On the other hand, we show that Bandwidth is W[1]-hard when parameterized only by cvd. Our results develop and generalize some of the methods of argumentation of the previous results and narrow some of the complexity gaps.</description>

      <title>Learning Quantum Processes with Quantum Statistical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of learning quantum processes from quantum statistical queries. We focus on two fundamental learning tasks in this new access model: shadow tomography of quantum processes and process tomography with respect to diamond distance. For the former, we present an efficient average-case algorithm along with a nearly matching lower bound with respect to the number of observables to be predicted. For the latter, we present average-case query complexity lower bounds for learning classes of unitaries. We obtain an exponential lower bound for learning unitary 2-designs and a doubly exponential lower bound for Haar-random unitaries. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our access model by applying our learning algorithm to attack an authentication protocol using Classical-Readout Quantum Physically Unclonable Functions, partially addressing an important open question in quantum hardware security.</description>

Abstract: We study the computational complexity of determining whether a cellular automaton is sensitive to initial conditions. We show that this problem is $\Pi^0_2$-complete in dimension 1 and $\Sigma^0_3$-complete in dimension 2 and higher. This solves a question posed by Sablik and Theyssier.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform Rectangular Index Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In~\cite{sic-magazine-2025}, the authors show that the square index coefficients (SICs) of the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) -- that is, the coefficients $X_{k\sqrt{N}}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, \sqrt{N} - 1$ -- can be losslessly compressed from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$ points, thereby accelerating the computation of these specific DFT coefficients accordingly. Following up on that, in this article we generalize SICs into what we refer to as rectangular index coefficients (RICs) of the DFT, formalized as $X_{kL}, k=0,1,\cdots,C-1$, in which the integers $C$ and $L$ are generic roots of $N$ such that $N=LC$. We present an algorithm to compress the $N$-point input signal $\mathbf{x}$ into a $C$-point signal $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ at the expense of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complex sums and no complex multiplication. We show that a DFT on $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ is equivalent to a DFT on the RICs of $\mathbf{x}$. In cases where specific frequencies of $\mathbf{x}$ are of interest -- as in harmonic analysis -- one can conveniently adjust the signal parameters (e.g., frequency resolution) to align the RICs with those frequencies, and use the proposed algorithm to compute them significantly faster. If $N$ is a power of two -- as required by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm -- then $C$ can be any power of two in the range $[2, N/2]$ and one can use our algorithm along with FFT to compute all RICs in $\mathcal{O}(C\log C)$ time complexity.</description>
