      <title>Heatpipe-cooled in-vacuum electromagnet for quantum science experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.</description>

      <title>Voltage and power-frequency electric field measurements with Rydberg-atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Rydberg-atom interferometry-based technique for voltage measurement between electrodes embedded in an atomic vapor cell, enabling the detection of weak voltages ($&lt;0.1$V) and unambiguous discrimination between positive and negative polarities. This makes up for the shortcomings of measurements based on the Stark effect, which suffer from quadratic field dependence (limiting sensitivity in weak-field regimes) and incapable of distinguishing the electric field direction. Furthermore, this method extends naturally to power-frequency (PF) electric field measurements by exploiting the quasi-static approximation-valid given the PF field's characteristic timescale ($\sim10^{-2}$s) vastly exceeds the interferometric measurement duration ($\sim10^{-6}$s). Crucially, our protocol provides instantaneous PF field reconstruction, providing comprehensive information including amplitude, frequency and phase. These advancements have direct implications for traceable voltage measurements and non-invasive characterization of PF fields near high-voltage infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength micromachined vapor-cell based Rydberg sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, micromachined vapor cells have been revolutionizing the field of chip-scale quantum sensors such as magnetometers and atomic clocks. In parallel, Rydberg atomic quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful technique for broadband, non-invasive, and ultra-sensitive electrometry. Yet, to date, Rydberg sensing has largely been limited to glass-blown, cm-scale vapor cells. Here, we perform Rydberg spectroscopy using a wafer-scale fabricated Pyrex-Si-Pyrex cell with mm-scale dimensions. The Rydberg spectroscopic line is characterized with respect to critical parameters such as temperature, the frequency and amplitude of the applied radiofrequency field, light intensity, and the spatial position of atom interrogation. Our study reveals lineshapes directly influenced by a complex landscape of electrostatic fields with values up to approximately $0.6\ \mathrm{V/cm}$. By controlling key parameters, we were able to reduce the effect of these internal electric fields and demonstrate the detection of RF fields with a sensitivity as low as $10\ \mu\mathrm{V/cm}$. These results highlight the potential of micromachined vapor cells for sub-wavelength electromagnetic field measurements, with applications in communications, near-field RF imaging, and chip-scale quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multiphoton-Multiatom Processes in Atomic Gases and Their Application in Enhancing Ultraweak Atomic Absorption Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate simultaneous multiphoton-multiatom (MPMA) processes in atomic gases subjected to laser fields. Our study reveals that the composite factor governing the transition rate of these processes can reach extraordinarily high magnitudes, with an intrinsic regulation mechanism causing the rate to exhibit near-saturation behavior. By integrating an MPMA process into an ultraweak atomic absorption transition, a substantial enhancement of the overall transition rate can be achieved. This enhancement enables the detection of transitions that would otherwise remain undetectable, thereby opening new avenues for exploring ultraweak quantum phenomena in atomic systems.</description>

      <title>De-excitation of $K$-shell hollow atoms with $12 \le Z \le 20$: transition rates and branching ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating $K$-shell hollow atom spectra enhances our understanding of femtosecond phenomena in atomic physics, chemistry, and biology. Synchrotron measurements of two-electron one-photon (TEOP) transitions in low-$Z$ atoms have revealed discrepancies between experimental results and theoretical predictions of TEOP relative intensities. These discrepancies appear to originate from an incomplete description of an atom's response to the strong perturbation caused by $K$-shell double photoionization (DPI). The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock relativistic configuration interaction method has been applied for studying the TEOP spectra of Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Ca atoms. The results show that branching ratios can be accurately reproduced by accounting for the effects of core and valence electron correlations, as well as the outer-shell ionization and excitation processes following $K$-shell DPI.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring via Quantum Optimization on a Rydberg-Qudit Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a versatile candidate for the embedding of hard classical optimization problems. Prior work has focused on mapping problems onto finding the maximum independent set of weighted or unweighted unit disk graphs. In this paper we introduce a new approach to solving natively-embedded vertex graph coloring problems by performing coherent annealing with Rydberg-qudit atoms, where different same-parity Rydberg levels represent a distinct label or color. We demonstrate the ability to robustly find optimal graph colorings for chromatic numbers up to the number of distinct Rydberg states used, in our case $k=3$. We analyze the impact of both the long-range potential tails and residual inter-state interactions, proposing encoding strategies that suppress errors in the resulting ground states. We discuss the experimental feasibility of this approach and propose extensions to solve higher chromatic number problems, providing a route towards direct solution of a wide range of real-world integer optimization problems using near-term neutral atom hardware.</description>

      <title>Imbibition of Oil in Dry and Prewetted Calcite Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid imbibition into porous media featuring nanopores is ubiquitous in applications such as oil recovery from unconventional reservoirs and material processing. While the imbibition of pure fluids has been extensively studied, the imbibition of fluid mixture is little explored. Here we report the molecular dynamics study of the imbibition of model crude oil into nanometer-wide mineral pores, both when pore walls are dry and prewetted by a residual water film. Results show the fastest imbibition and quickest propagation of molecularly thin precursor films ahead of the oil meniscus in the dry pore system. The presence of a thin water film on pore walls corresponding to an environmental relative humidity of 30% slows down but still allows the spontaneous imbibition of single-component oil. Introducing polar components into the oil slows down the imbibition into dry nanopores, due partly to the clogging of the pore entrance. Strong selectivity toward nonpolar oil is evident. The slowdown of imbibition by polar oil is less significant in the prewetted pores than in dry pores, but the selectivity toward nonpolar oil remains strong.</description>

      <title>The Chemistry and Physics of $^{199}$Hg Nuclear Spin Polarization Relaxation in Quantum Magnetometry Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin magnetometry using optically pumped $^{199}$Hg has been successfully used in many fundamental physics experiments. A serious problem that has not been resolved is the instability of the $^{199}$Hg spin relaxation rate in atomic vapor cells under irradiation with 254 nm Hg resonance light. In this paper, previously obtained data are re-analyzed or analyzed for the first time. The effects of impurities of H$_2$ and O$_2$ are elucidated, and possible ways to stabilize cells are discussed. Surface states originating from the an der Waals interaction of \hg with fused silica are analyzed and shown to be critical to understanding relaxation mechanisms. A discussion of the possible use of a mixture of N$_2$O and other gases is presented.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Atom Interferometer to Detect Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AION project has built a tabletop prototype of a single-photon long-baseline atom interferometer using the 87Sr clock transition - a type of quantum sensor designed to search for dark matter and gravitational waves. Our prototype detector operates at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), producing a signal with no unexpected noise beyond atom shot noise. Importantly, the detector remains at the SQL even when additional laser phase noise is introduced, emulating conditions in a long-baseline detector such as AION or AEDGE where significant laser phase deviations will accumulate during long atom interrogation times. Our results mark a key milestone in extending atom interferometers to long baselines. Such interferometers can complement laser-interferometer gravitational wave detectors by accessing the mid-frequency gravitational wave band around 1 Hz, and can search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Tunable Molecular Interactions Near an Atomic Feshbach Resonance: Stability and Collapse of a Molecular Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling interactions of ultracold molecules has been a central goal in quantum chemistry research. Recent experiments on atoms near a Feshbach resonance offer the key to prepare and investigate molecules in the quantum many-body regime. Just as Feshbach resonances allow tuning of the scattering length of bosonic atoms, we show that they also modify the scattering length of Feshbach molecules which are constituted from these atoms. Based on calculations of the compressibility, we determine the stability phase diagrams of molecular condensates and show that their instability can be associated with a sign change of the inter-molecular interactions. We derive universal expressions for the molecular scattering lengths, presented in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. These will enable control of interactions between Feshbach molecules as well as further studies of few- and many-body reactions involving Feshbach molecules in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spatial light modulation in the ultraviolet spectral range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial light modulators enable arbitrary control of the intensity of optical light fields and facilitate a variety of applications in biology, astronomy and atomic, molecular and optical physics. For coherent light fields, holography, implemented through arbitrary phase modulation, represents a highly power-efficient technique to shape the intensity of light patterns. Here, we introduce and benchmark a novel spatial light modulator based on a piston micro-mirror array. In particular, we utilize the reflection-based device to demonstrate arbitrary beam shaping in the ultraviolet regime at a wavelength of 322 nm. We correct aberrations of the reflected wavefront and show that the modulator does not add detectable excess phase noise to the reflected light field. We utilize the intrinsically low latency of the architecture to demonstrate fast switching of arbitrary light patterns synchronized with short laser pulses at an update rate of 1 kHz. Finally, we outline how the modulator can act as an important component of a zone-based architecture for a neutral-atom quantum computer or simulator, including ultraviolet wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <title>Bagci-Hoggan Complete and Orthonormal Sets of ETOs. Results for He-like atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock-Rothaan equations are solved for He-like ions using the iterative self-consistent method. Bagci-Hoggan complete and orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals are employed as the basis. These orbitals satisfy the orthonormality relationship for quantum numbers with fractional order. They are solution of Schrodinger-like differential equation derived by the author. In a recent study conducted for the calculation of the hydrogen atom energy levels, it has been demonstrated that the fractional formalism of the principal and the angular momentum quantum numbers converges to the 1s level of the ground state energy of hydrogen atom, obtained from the solution of the standard Schrodinger equation. This study examines the effect of fractional values of the quantum numbers for two-electron systems, where electron correlation effects exist.</description>

      <title>Trapping potentials and quantum gates for microwave-dressed Rydberg atoms on an atom chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in static electric fields possess permanent dipole moments. When the atoms are close to a surface producing an inhomogeneous electric field, such as by the adsorbates on an atom chip, depending on the sign of the dipole moment of the Rydberg-Stark eigenstate, the atoms may experience a force towards or away from the surface. We show that by applying a bias electric field and coupling a desired Rydberg state by a microwave field of proper frequency to another Rydberg state with opposite sign of the dipole moment, we can create a trapping potential for the atom at a prescribed distance from the surface. Perfectly overlapping trapping potentials for several Rydberg states can also be created by multi-component microwave fields. A pair of such trapped Rydberg states of an atom can represent a qubit. Finally, we discuss an optimal realization of the swap gate between pairs of such atomic Rydberg qubits separated by a large distance but interacting with a common mode of a planar microwave resonator at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Image Current Detection of Electrons in a Room-Temperature Paul Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the image current detection of electrons in a room-temperature Paul trap at microwave frequencies. By selectively leveraging distinct cavity modes for trapping and detection, our approach effectively extracts electron signals otherwise buried in the microwave drive used for pseudo-potential formation. When the trapped electrons resonate with the cavity mode, we observe a mode excitation and its exponential decay attributed to resistive cooling. Detuning electrons from the cavity resonance halts this decay, and sweeping electrons' secular frequency reveals their oscillatory spectrum. Implementing this experiment at cryogenic temperatures could enable the image current detection and ground-state cooling of a single electron in Paul traps.</description>

      <title>Semi-Analytical Engineering of Strongly Driven Nonlinear Systems Beyond Floquet and Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly driven nonlinear systems are frequently encountered in physics, yet their accurate control is generally challenging due to the intricate dynamics. In this work, we present a non-perturbative, semi-analytical framework for tailoring such systems. The key idea is heuristically extending the Floquet theory to nonlinear differential equations using the Harmonic Balance method. Additionally, we establish a novel constrained optimization technique inspired by the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enables accurate engineering of effective potentials across a broader parameter space, surpassing the limitations of perturbative methods. Our method offers practical implementations in diverse experimental platforms, facilitating nonclassical state generation, versatile bosonic quantum simulations, and solving complex optimization problems across quantum and classical applications.</description>
