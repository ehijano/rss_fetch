      <title>Modeling the light response of an optically readout GEM based TPC for the CYGNO experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of gaseous Time Projection Chambers enables the detection and the detailed study of rare events due to particles interactions with the atoms of the gas with energy releases as low as a few keV. Due to this capability, these instruments are being developed for applications in the field of astroparticle physics, such as the study of dark matter and neutrinos. To readout events occurring in the sensitive volume with a high granularity, the CYGNO collaboration is developing a solution where the light generated during the avalanche processes occurring in a multiplication stage based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is read out by optical sensors with very high sensitivity and spatial resolution. To achieve a high light output, gas gain values of the order of $10^5\text{-}10^6$ are needed. Experimentally, a dependence of the detector response on the spatial density of the charge collected in the GEM holes has been observed, indicating a gain-reduction effect likely caused by space-charge buildup within the multiplication channels. This paper presents data collected with a prototype featuring a sensitive volume of about two liters, together with a model developed by the collaboration to describe and predict the gain dependence on charge density. A comparison with experimental data shows that the model accurately reproduces the gain behaviour over nearly one order of magnitude, with a percent-level precision.</description>

      <title>Removing constraints of 4D-STEM with a framework for event-driven acquisition and processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixelated detectors in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) generate large volumes of data, often tens to hundreds of GB per scan. However, to make current advancements scalable and enable widespread adoption, it is essential to use the most efficient representation of an electron's information. Event-driven direct electron detectors, such as those based on the Timepix3 chip, offer significant potential for electron microscopy, particularly for low-dose experiments and real-time data processing. In this study, we compare sparse and dense data representations in terms of their size and computational requirements across various 4D-STEM scenarios, including high-resolution imaging and nano-beam electron diffraction. The advantages of performing 4D-STEM in an event-driven mode - such as reduced requirements in memory, bandwidth, and computational demands - can only be fully leveraged if the entire acquisition and processing pipeline is optimized to work directly with the event format, avoiding intermediate dense representations. We introduce a framework designed for acquisition and processing based on this event format, and demonstrate live processing of event-driven 4D-STEM, including analytical ptychography.</description>

      <title>Qualification of Bump Bonding in CMS Inner Tracker Pixel Modules for the Phase-2 Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully exploit the increased luminosity of the HL-LHC, the CMS Inner Tracker is undergoing a major upgrade to withstand extreme radiation levels and data rates, while improving granularity and reducing material budget. The upgraded modules employ thin planar and 3D silicon pixel sensors, bump bonded to a new radiation-hard readout chip, the CROC, designed in 65 nm CMOS technology and powered via a serial scheme. Ensuring the quality of bump bonding between sensors and readout chips is critical for efficient detector operation. This work presents the qualification procedures developed to identify missing or defective bumps using multiple test methods, including crosstalk analysis, reverse/forward bias testing, and X-ray or beta source imaging. Results from prototype modules are presented, and advantages and limitations of each method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray and high-energy X-ray detection with large area scintillating crystals: a hands-on review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of photons with scintillating inorganic crystals in the high-energy range (&gt; 0.1 MeV) will be discussed, making a comparison with other available methods. Energy resolutions up to 2 % at 662 keV and fast decay time of the order of 20 ns are within reach, with the introduction of Ce-doped crystals instead of alkali halide ones. Development is underway for the production of non-hygroscopic scintillating crystals, such as PrLuAg and CE:GAAG. At the end of this review, examples of experimental devices based on scintillating inorganic crystals will be discussed. Practical hands-on experience is emphasized at the expense of a more comprehensive description of all available and possible options. Detectors' construction details and the consequences of the different choices will be discussed. Emphasis will be put on the LaBr3:Ce-based detectors that are the present ''golden standard'' in gamma ray spectroscopy. This review will focus on photon detection in the high-energy region: mainly 0.1-2 MeV, including both gamma rays and high-energy X-rays, even if many considerations may be applied to the detection of low-energy X-rays.</description>

      <title>Results from a 2nd production run of low temperature wafer-wafer bonded pad-diodes for particle detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are investigating the use of low temperature wafer-wafer bonding in the fabrication of next-generation particle pixel detectors. This bonding technique could enable the integration of fully processed CMOS readout wafers with high-Z absorber materials, facilitating the creation of highly efficient X-ray imaging detectors. It might also facilitate the integration of structures embedded inside the wafer bulk, such as deep uniform gain layers. The bonding process results in a thin (nm-scale) amorphous layer at the bonding interface. To study the impact of this interface on detector operation, we fabricated simple wafer-wafer bonded pad diodes using high resistivity float-zone silicon wafers. Results from a first fabrication run of such diodes revealed that the presence of the bonding interface alters the depletion behaviour, with the interface acting as a heavily doped N++ layer. However, metal contamination of the bonding surfaces during fabrication compromised these results, making them unrepresentative of an ideal bonding interface. In this paper we present the results from a subsequent fabrication run, which does not exhibit this sort of metal contamination. These results confirm that the bonding interface behaves as a heavily doped N++ layer, even without contamination. Further, we discuss the reverse leakage current of the bonded samples, where current vs. voltage measurements show a behaviour which is consistent with current generated within the depletion region of the samples.</description>

      <title>Development of the Range Counter for the COMET Phase-$\alpha$ Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COMET Phase-$\alpha$ experiment aims to evaluate the novel muon transport beamline for the muon-to-electron conversion search at J-PARC, Japan. A dedicated Range Counter (RC) was developed to measure the momentum spectrum of transported negative muons with momenta of 30--100 MeV/$c$. The RC consists of graphite momentum degraders, a muon absorber, and plastic scintillation counters ($\rm T_0$, $\rm T_1$, and $\rm T_2$) to detect decay-in-orbit (DIO) electrons from stopped muons. The number of muons stopped in the absorber is reconstructed from the decay time distribution. A copper absorber was selected due to the short lifetime of muonic atoms in copper, which enhances signal separation. The counters' performance was evaluated experimentally. The $\rm T_0$ Counter, made of a $200\times 200\times 0.5~{\rm mm^3}$ scintillator plate, achieved a muon-trigger efficiency exceeding 99.9%. The $\rm T_1$ and $\rm T_2$ Counters also demonstrated high electron-detection efficiencies of $&gt;99$%. Based on these results, simulation studies estimate the acceptance for reconstructing the number of DIO electrons from the absorber to be approximately 47% with a corresponding signal purity of 60% against muon capture-induced backgrounds.</description>

      <title>A two-stage time-stretching TDC with discrete components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and testing of a time-stretching-based time-to-digital converter (TDC) implemented with discrete components. The TDC utilizes capacitor charging and discharging to achieve a time resolution of under 100 ps using a 100 MHz clock counter on a low-power, low-cost FPGA, achieving a time amplification factor of over 100. A two-stage time-stretching architecture is employed to reduce the conversion time to below 300 ns for a 10 ns input range. An onboard calibration system, including a pulse generation circuit, is implemented, and calibration results are presented. This system serves as a proof-of-concept platform for circuit optimization toward an ASIC implementation of a front-end TDC targeting future 4D pixel detectors at hadron colliders, with goals of sub-50 ps resolution and power consumption at the $\mu$W/channel level. Additionally, the design offers a modular, low-cost solution for extracting signal arrival times with 100 ps precision in particle physics experiments, such as photoelectron timing extraction for photodetector readout in neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Performance and Design Validation of CMS Phase-2 Pixel Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the High Luminosity LHC, the current CMS tracking detector will have to be replaced during Long Shutdown 3 to cope with the higher radiation environment and to withstand an increased data rate. To prepare for the so-called CMS Phase-2 upgrade, multiple studies were carried out to characterize the pixel module design and its performance with a particular focus on the Quality Control (QC) and Assurance. For this purpose, different aspects were put together to establish a module full-performance test procedure, and novel techniques became part of the module design validation process for the full-size readout chip (CROCv1). Based on the results collected on CROCv1 prototype modules and according to the module selection criteria the community agreed on, some changes were introduced in the module design to improve the performance. This resulted in multiple prototype versions, including the production of the definitive chip (CROCv2). This study presents the quality control test flow performed, both for the dual and quad-chip module designs, on a big sample of CROCv1 prototypes and on several Kick-off and CROCv2 pre-production modules. In particular, the validation process includes measurements of the readout chip powering, sensor IV bias and open bump bonds identification. Thermal stress tests in extended temperature ranges were performed only on a subset of pixel modules to ensure the integrity of the sensor and to provide quick feedback on the quality of the bump bond connectivity after harsh temperature cycles.</description>

      <title>Improving 5G/B5G Network Performance with RFID-Enabled Resource Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of 5G and B5G (beyond 5G) networks, efficient resource optimization is critical to addressing the escalating demands for high-speed, low-latency, and energy efficient communication. This study explores the integration of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology as a novel approach to enhance resource management in 5G/B5G networks. The motivation behind this research lies in overcoming persistent challenges such as spectrum congestion, high latency, and inefficient load balancing, which impede the performance of traditional resource allocation methods. To achieve this, RFID tags were embedded in critical network components, including user devices, base stations, and Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, enabling the collection of real-time data on device status, location, and resource utilization. RFID readers strategically placed across the network continuously captured this data, which was processed by a centralized controller using a custom-designed optimization algorithm. This algorithm dynamically managed key network resources, including spectrum allocation, load balancing, and energy consumption, ensuring efficient operation under varying network conditions. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the RFID-based model against traditional 4G dynamic resource allocation techniques. The results demonstrated substantial improvements in key performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Adjusting optical cavity birefringence with wavelength tunable laser for axion searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions have attracted attention promising candidates for dark matter (DM). Although axions have been intensively searched for, they have not been observed yet. Recently, novel experiments to search for axion DM have been proposed that use optical cavities to amplify polarization rotation of laser light induced by the axion-photon interaction. One such experiment employs a ring cavity composed of four mirrors. However, its sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling $\gag$ in the low axion mass region is limited due to the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the sensitivity using zero-phase shift mirrors and a wavelength tunable laser. Moreover, the laser makes it easier to scan the high axion mass region by tuning the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. We experimentally confirmed that the phase difference generated upon reflection on a zero phase shift mirror satisfies the requirement of $8.6 \times 10^{-3}~\si{deg}$, which corresponds to the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the p-polarization with the mirror fixed on a folded cavity and a wavelength tunable laser.</description>

Abstract: The proposed high-luminosity, circular electron-positron collider, FCC-ee, provides unparalleled opportunities for precise exploration of Higgs, electroweak, top, flavour, and beyond standard model physics. Very advanced detector systems are required to fully exploit this diverse physics programme. Key requirements include excellent resolutions on the measurement of momentum, energy, and impact parameters; exquisite particle identification capabilities over a wide momentum range including photon/{\pi}0 separation; sensitivity to far-displaced vertices in the tracking (and possibly also the calorimeter) volume; and very precise absolute and relative normalisation.

      <title>Lightweight Deep Learning Framework for Accurate Particle Flow Energy Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under extreme operating conditions, characterized by high particle multiplicity and heavily overlapping shower energy deposits, classical particle flow algorithms encounter pronounced limitations in resolution, efficiency, and accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper proposes and systematically evaluates a deep learning reconstruction framework: For multichannel sparse features, we design a hybrid loss function combining weighted mean squared error with structural similarity index, effectively balancing pixel-level accuracy and structural fidelity. By integrating 3D convolutions, Squeeze-and-Excitation channel attention, and Offset self-attention modules into baseline convolutional neural networks, we enhance the model's capability to capture cross-modal spatiotemporal correlations and energy-displacement nonlinearities. Validated on custom-constructed simulation data and Pythia jet datasets, the framework's 90K-parameter lightweight variant approaches the performance of 5M-parameter baselines, while the 25M-parameter 3D model achieves state-of-the-art results in both interpolation and extrapolation tasks. Comprehensive experiments quantitatively evaluate component contributions and provide performance-parameter trade-off guidelines. All core code and data processing scripts are open-sourced on a GitHub repository to facilitate community reproducibility and extension.</description>

      <title>Drift time calibration of the ultra-low material budget GEM-based TPC for MIXE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) is a non-destructive analytical technique that leverages negative muons to probe elemental and isotopic compositions by detecting characteristic muonic X-rays emitted during atomic cascades and gamma rays from nuclear capture processes. By controlling the muon beam momentum, MIXE enables depth-resolved analysis, spanning microns to centimeters, making it ideal for studying compositional variations in fragile, valuable, or operando samples. To enhance its capabilities, we integrated a twin Time Projection Chamber (TPC) tracker with Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) amplification stages, allowing precise measurement of muon trajectories. A custom-built fiber detector with scintillating fibers and a Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) provides permille-level accuracy in drift velocity calibration, essential for accurate spatial reconstruction. This advanced setup correlates muon stopping points with X-ray emissions, paving the way towards element-sensitive imaging and establishing MIXE as a unique tool for high-resolution, depth-specific elemental analysis across diverse scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Research on trigger technology of MRPC TOF-PET system and imaging results of $^{22}$Na radioactive source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on developing a self-triggered data acquisition system and a noise reduction algorithm for the Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography (TOF-PET) system. The system integrates a fast front-end amplifier, a waveform digitization module based on the DRS4 chip, and an efficient noise reduction algorithm to address challenges such as high noise trigger rates and precise gamma-ray detection. The proposed self-triggered system, through threshold discrimination, coincidence logic, and continuous oscillation check, reduces the noise trigger rate to 0.004 Hz. Experimental results show that the system accurately localizes and images the $^{22}$Na radioactive source, and has a good time resolution of 162 ps FWHM for 0.511 MeV gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Deuterium-deuterium fusion charged particle detection using CR-39 and Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors are widely used in fusion research for detecting charged particles produced in fusion reactions. However, analyzing increasingly complex and large-scale CR-39 track images to extract meaningful information can be a tedious and time-consuming process, often prone to human errors and bias. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-based classification model capable of differentiating protons, tritons, and helions produced during D-D fusion, using CR-39 track images as input data. The CR-39 track images were processed and used to train a deep learning model. By preprocessing the track images for noise reduction and feature enhancement, we trained the YOLOv8 [1][2] network to distinguish the three particle types with high accuracy. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of over 96%, demonstrating its potential for improving automated track analysis in CR-39 detectors. Additionally, the model precisely identifies particle coordinates and counts, enabling comprehensive particle analysis. This study highlights the application of AI in track detection and classification, offering a robust solution for particle identification in CR-39 detector-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Linear Response of CsI(Tl) Crystal to Energetic Photons below 20 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear response of CsI(Tl) crystals to $\gamma$-rays plays a crucial role in their calibration, as any deviation from linearity can introduce systematic errors not negligible in the measurement of $\gamma$ energy spectra, particularly at high energies. In this study, the responses of CsI(Tl) crystals to high-energy photons up to 20 MeV are investigated using quasi monochromatic $\gamma$ beam provided by the Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source. The spectra are folded using a detector filter implemented by Geant4. Both quadratic and linear fits to six energy points are used to assess the linearity of the CsI(Tl) detector. The results demonstrate that the difference between the linear and non-linear fits is at the level of 4\%. Applying these findings to the $\gamma$ hodoscope of the Compact Spectrometer for Heavy Ion Experiment (CSHINE), the potential systematic uncertainties caused by CsI(Tl) non-linearity are evaluated. This work provides a comprehensive calibration methodology for employing CsI(Tl) crystal to detect high energy $\gamma$-rays.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron light source focused X-ray detection with LGADs, AC-LGADs and TI-LGADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The response of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs), a type of thin silicon detector with internal gain, to X-rays of energies between 6-16~keV was characterized at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). The utilized beamline at SSRL was 7-2, with a nominal beam size of 30~$\mu$m, repetition rate of 500~MHz, and with an energy dispersion $\Delta E/E$ of $10^{-4}$. Multi-channel LGADs, AC-LGADs, and TI-LGADs of different thicknesses and gain layer configurations from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) were tested. The sensors were read out with a discrete component board and digitized with a fast oscilloscope or a CAEN fast digitizer. The devices' energy response, energy resolution, and time resolution were measured as a function of X-ray energy and position. The charge collection and multiplication mechanism were simulated using TCAD Sentaurus, and the results were compared with the collected data.</description>

      <title>Near-quantum-limited axion dark matter search with the ORGAN experiment around 26 $\mu$eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest result from the ORGAN experiment, an axion haloscope is presented. This iteration of the experiment operated at millikelvin temperatures using a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier for reduced noise, along with various other improvements over previous iterations. Covering the $25.45 - 26.27\,\mu\text{eV}$ ($6.15-6.35$ GHz) mass (frequency) range, this near-quantum limited phase of ORGAN employs a conducting rod resonator and a 7-T solenoidal magnet to place the most sensitive exclusion limits on axion-photon coupling in the range to date, with $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \gtrsim 2.8\times10^{-13}$ at a 95\% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Long term remote reactor power and fuel composition monitoring using antineutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron antineutrinos are emitted in the decay chains of the fission products inside a reactor core and could be used for remote monitoring of nuclear reactors. The DANSS detector is placed under the core of the 3.1 GW power reactor at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) and collects up to 5000 antineutrino events per day. DANSS measured changes of the reactor power by antineutrino counting rates over 7 years with 1.0% accuracy in one week periods. The fission fractions of four major isotopes for the reactor power calculations were provided by KNPP. The systematic uncertainty of this measurement is less than 0.8%. It is comparable to the accuracy of conventional methods of the reactor power measurements while it is based on completely different approach. For the first time the 239Pu and 235U fission fractions were reconstructed using antineutrino inverse beta-decay spectrum which is a completely new technique. This method was applied to the data from three reactor fuel campaigns (approximately 1.5 year each). The reconstructed fission fractions in about two-week measurements and the fission fractions provided by KNPP coincide within better than 3% accuracy. This provides confidence in both completely different approaches of the fission fraction determination.</description>

      <title>COCOA: a compact Compton camera for astrophysical observation of MeV-scale gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COCOA (COmpact COmpton cAmera) is a next-generation gamma-ray telescope designed for astrophysical observations in the MeV energy range. The detector comprises a scatterer volume employing the LiquidO detection technology and an array of scintillating crystals acting as absorber. Surrounding plastic scintillator panels serve as a veto system for charged particles. The detector's compact, scalable design enables flexible deployment on microsatellites or high-altitude balloons. Gamma rays at MeV energies have not been well explored historically (the so-called "MeV gap") and COCOA has the potential to improve the sensitivity in this energy band.</description>
