      <title>Inverse learning of black-box aggregator for robust Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the robustness of Nash equilibria (NE) in multi-player aggregative games with coupling constraints. There are many algorithms for computing an NE of an aggregative game given a known aggregator. When the coupling parameters are affected by uncertainty, robust NE need to be computed. We consider a scenario where players' weight in the aggregator is unknown, making the aggregator kind of "a black box". We pursue a suitable learning approach to estimate the unknown aggregator by proposing an inverse variational inequality-based relationship. We then utilize the counterpart to reconstruct the game and obtain first-order conditions for robust NE in the worst case. Furthermore, we characterize the generalization property of the learning methodology via an upper bound on the violation probability. Simulation experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed inverse learning approach.</description>

      <title>A Novel Mutual Insurance Model for Hedging Against Cyber Risks in Power Systems Deploying Smart Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel cyber-insurance model design is proposed based on system risk evaluation with smart technology applications. The cyber insurance policy for power systems is tailored via cyber risk modeling, reliability impact analysis, and insurance premium calculation. A stochastic Epidemic Network Model is developed to evaluate the cyber risk by propagating cyberattacks among graphical vulnerabilities. Smart technologies deployed in risk modeling include smart monitoring and job thread assignment. Smart monitoring boosts the substation availability against cyberattacks with preventive and corrective measures. The job thread assignment solution reduces the execution failures by distributing the control and monitoring tasks to multiple threads. Reliability assessment is deployed to estimate load losses convertible to monetary losses. These monetary losses would be shared through a mutual insurance plan. To ensure a fair distribution of indemnity, a new Shapley mutual insurance principle is devised. Effectiveness of the proposed Shapley mutual insurance design is validated via case studies. The Shapley premium is compared with existent premium designs. It is shown that the Shapley premium has high indemnity levels closer to those of Tail Conditional Expectation premium. Meanwhile, the Shapley premium is nearly as affordable as the coalitional premium and keeps a relatively low insolvency probability.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Resolution Boundary of Outcome-Based Imperfect-Recall Abstraction in Games with Ordered Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the development of advanced Texas Hold'em AI systems, abstraction technology has garnered widespread attention due to its significant effect in simplifying game complexity. This study adopts a more specific model, the games of ordered signal, to describe Texas Hold'em-style games and optimizes this model to streamline its mathematical representation and broaden its applicability. By transitioning from a broad imperfect information game model to a game with ordered signals model, we have separated the previously intertwined infoset abstraction and action abstraction into independent signal abstraction and action abstraction. Importantly, this signal abstraction provides a mathematical framework for the hand abstraction task, which is emphatically discussed in this paper. Additionally, a novel common refinement principle is introduced, revealing the limit performance of hand abstraction algorithms. We introduce potential outcome isomorphism (POI) and pinpoint that it suffers from the issue of excessive abstraction. Futher, We demonstrate that POI serves as a common refinement for leading outcome-based hand abstraction algorithms, such as E[HS] and PA\&amp;PAEMD. Consequently, excessive abstraction also inherently affects these algorithms, leading to suboptimal performance. Our investigation reveals the omission of historical data as a primary contributor to excessive abstraction. To remedy this, we propose the K-Recall Outcome Isomorphism (KROI) to incorporate the missing information. Compared with POI, KROI more accurately mirrors lossless isomorphism (LI), the ground truth, offering enhanced signal abstraction resolution. Experimental results in the Numeral211 Hold'em indicate that strategies developed through KROI approximate the exploitability of those developed through LI more closely than those trained through POI.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Agri-Food Export under Minimum Quantity Commitments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: International trade can be a profitable business for agri-food communities. However, access to international markets can be costly and thus unattainable for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This problem is exacerbated under trade policies which require minimum quantity commitments (MQCs) on export volumes, e.g., licensing tariff rate quota (TRQ) mechanisms.
  We show how cooperative exporting among agri-food SMEs can tackle the barriers posed by the MQCs, and give market access to a broader range of SMEs. We formulate a class of cooperative games associated with these situations and find a gain-sharing mechanism that result in allocations in their corresponding cores. Thus, grand coalitions of cooperative exporting SMEs can form in stable manners.
  This allocation rule shares the export surplus only among the "essential" SME exporters, that is, the players who are sufficiently cost efficient. Thus, less cost efficient "complimentary" SMEs whose capacities are needed to maintain MQCs receive no benefit from collaborative exporting and their participation have to be altruistic. We propose two modifications to our original allocation rule to share a portion of export surplus among the complementary SMEs through taxing the essential SMEs: the first through egalitarian, and the second through revenue-based rates. We compare the performance of these allocations with the numerical examples and discuss their practical implications.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Game and Foundation Models for Cyber Deception Operations in Strategic Cyber Warfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools. In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges associated with FMs and their application in the domain of cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Auctions with Dynamic Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the design of auctions with dynamic scoring, which allocate a single item according to a given scoring rule. We are motivated by online advertising auctions when users interact with a platform over the course of a session. The platform ranks ads based on a combination of bids and quality scores, and updates the quality scores throughout the session based on the user's online activity. The platform must decide when to show an ad during the session. By delaying the auction, the auctioneer acquires information about an ad's quality, improving her chances of selecting a high quality ad. However information is costly, because delay reduces market thickness and in turn revenue. When should the auctioneer allocate the impression to balance these forces?
  We develop a theoretical model to study the effect of market design on the trade-off between market thickness and information. In particular, we focus on first- and second-price auctions. The auctioneer can commit to the auction format, but not to its timing: her decision can thus be cast as a real options problem. We show that under optimal stopping the first-price auction allocates efficiently but with delay. Instead, the second-price auction generates more revenue by avoiding delay. The auctioneer benefits from introducing reserve prices, more so in a first-price auction.</description>

      <title>Barely Random Algorithms for Metrical Task Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider metrical task systems on general metric spaces with $n$ points, and show that any fully randomized algorithm can be turned into a randomized algorithm that uses only $2\log n$ random bits, and achieves the same competitive ratio up to a factor $2$. This provides the first order-optimal barely random algorithms for metrical task systems, i.e. which use a number of random bits that does not depend on the number of requests addressed to the system. We put forward an equivalent view that we call collective metrical task systems where $k$ agents in a metrical task system team up, and suffer the average cost paid by each agent. Our results imply that such team can be $O(\log n^2)$-competitive, as soon as $k\geq n^2$ (in comparison, a single agent is $\Omega(n)$-competitive at best). We discuss implications on various aspects of online decision making such as: distributed systems, transaction costs, and advice complexity, suggesting broad applicability.</description>

      <title>An upper bound of the mutation probability in the genetic algorithm for general 0-1 knapsack problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an important part of genetic algorithms (GAs), mutation operators is widely used in evolutionary algorithms to solve $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems because it can increase the population diversity of individual. Due to limitations in mathematical tools, the mutation probability of the mutation operator is primarily empirically set in practical applications.
  In this paper, we propose a novel reduction method for the 0-1 knapsack problem(0-1 KP) and an improved mutation operator (IMO) based on the assumption $\mathcal{NP}\neq\mathcal{P}$, along with the utilization of linear relaxation techniques and a recent result by Dey et al. (Math. Prog., pp 569-587, 2022). We employ this method to calculate an upper bound of the mutation probability in general instances of the 0-1 KP, and construct an instance where the mutation probability does not tend towards 0 as the problem size increases. Finally, we prove that the probability of the IMO hitting the optimal solution within only a single iteration in large-scale instances is superior to that of the traditional mutation operator.</description>

      <title>Independent RL for Cooperative-Competitive Agents: A Mean-Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address in this paper Reinforcement Learning (RL) among agents that are grouped into teams such that there is cooperation within each team but general-sum (non-zero sum) competition across different teams. To develop an RL method that provably achieves a Nash equilibrium, we focus on a linear-quadratic structure. Moreover, to tackle the non-stationarity induced by multi-agent interactions in the finite population setting, we consider the case where the number of agents within each team is infinite, i.e., the mean-field setting. This results in a General-Sum LQ Mean-Field Type Game (GS-MFTGs). We characterize the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the GS-MFTG, under a standard invertibility condition. This MFTG NE is then shown to be $\mathcal{O}(1/M)$-NE for the finite population game where $M$ is a lower bound on the number of agents in each team. These structural results motivate an algorithm called Multi-player Receding-horizon Natural Policy Gradient (MRPG), where each team minimizes its cumulative cost independently in a receding-horizon manner. Despite the non-convexity of the problem, we establish that the resulting algorithm converges to a global NE through a novel problem decomposition into sub-problems using backward recursive discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations, in which independent natural policy gradient is shown to exhibit linear convergence under time-independent diagonal dominance. Experiments illuminate the merits of this approach in practice.</description>

      <title>A Simple 2-Approximation Algorithm For Minimum Manhattan Network Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a n points in two dimensional space, a Manhattan Network G is a network that connects all n points with either horizontal or vertical edges, with the property that for any two point in G should be connected by a Manhattan path and distance between this two points is equal to Manhattan Distance. The Minimum Manhattan Network problem is to find a Manhattan network with minimum network length, i.e., summation of all line segment in network should be minimize. In this paper, we proposed a 2-approximation algorithm with time complexity O(|E|lgN) where |E| is the number of edges and N is the number of nodes. Using randomly generated datasets, we compare our result with the optimal one.</description>

      <title>Contract-Based Distributed Synthesis in Two-Objective Parity Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method to compute $\textit{assume-guarantee contracts}$ in non-zerosum two-player games over finite graphs where each player has a different $ \omega $-regular winning condition. Given a game graph $G$ and two parity winning conditions $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$ over $G$, we compute $\textit{contracted strategy-masks}$ ($\texttt{csm}$) $(\Psi_{i},\Phi_{i})$ for each Player $i$. Within a $\texttt{csm}$, $\Phi_{i}$ is a $\textit{permissive strategy template}$ which collects an infinite number of winning strategies for Player $i$ under the assumption that Player $1-i$ chooses any strategy from the $\textit{permissive assumption template}$ $\Psi_{i}$. The main feature of $\texttt{csm}$'s is their power to $\textit{fully decentralize all remaining strategy choices}$ -- if the two player's $\texttt{csm}$'s are compatible, they provide a pair of new local specifications $\Phi_0^\bullet$ and $\Phi_1^\bullet$ such that Player $i$ can locally and fully independently choose any strategy satisfying $\Phi_i^\bullet$ and the resulting strategy profile is ensured to be winning in the original two-objective game $(G,\Phi_0,\Phi_1)$.
  In addition, the new specifications $\Phi_i^\bullet$ are $\textit{maximally cooperative}$, i.e., allow for the distributed synthesis of any cooperative solution. Further, our algorithmic computation of $\texttt{csm}$'s is complete and ensured to terminate.
  We illustrate how the unique features of our synthesis framework effectively address multiple challenges in the context of \enquote{correct-by-design} logical control software synthesis for cyber-physical systems and provide empirical evidence that our approach possess desirable structural and computational properties compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Mediator Interpretation and Faster Learning Algorithms for Linear Correlated Equilibria in General Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper by Farina &amp; Pipis (2023) established the existence of uncoupled no-linear-swap regret dynamics with polynomial-time iterations in extensive-form games. The equilibrium points reached by these dynamics, known as linear correlated equilibria, are currently the tightest known relaxation of correlated equilibrium that can be learned in polynomial time in any finite extensive-form game. However, their properties remain vastly unexplored, and their computation is onerous. In this paper, we provide several contributions shedding light on the fundamental nature of linear-swap regret. First, we show a connection between linear deviations and a generalization of communication deviations in which the player can make queries to a "mediator" who replies with action recommendations, and, critically, the player is not constrained to match the timing of the game as would be the case for communication deviations. We coin this latter set the untimed communication (UTC) deviations. We show that the UTC deviations coincide precisely with the linear deviations, and therefore that any player minimizing UTC regret also minimizes linear-swap regret. We then leverage this connection to develop state-of-the-art no-regret algorithms for computing linear correlated equilibria, both in theory and in practice. In theory, our algorithms achieve polynomially better per-iteration runtimes; in practice, our algorithms represent the state of the art by several orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: The Ethereum block-building process has changed significantly since the emergence of Proposer-Builder Separation. Validators access blocks through a marketplace, where block builders bid for the right to construct the block and earn MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) rewards in an on-chain competition, known as the MEV-boost auction. While more than 90% of blocks are currently built via MEV-Boost, trade-offs between builders' strategic behaviors and auction design remain poorly understood. In this paper we address this gap. We introduce a game-theoretic model for MEV-Boost auctions and use simulations to study different builders' bidding strategies observed in practice. We study various strategic interactions and auction setups and evaluate how the interplay between critical elements such as access to MEV opportunities and improved connectivity to relays impact bidding performance. Our results demonstrate the importance of latency on the effectiveness of builders' strategies and the overall auction outcome from the proposer's perspective.</description>

      <title>Single-Sample Prophet Inequalities via Greedy-Ordered Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study single-sample prophet inequalities (SSPIs), i.e., prophet inequalities where only a single sample from each prior distribution is available. Besides a direct, and optimal, SSPI for the basic single choice problem [Rubinstein et al., 2020], most existing SSPI results were obtained via an elegant, but inherently lossy, reduction to order-oblivious secretary (OOS) policies [Azar et al., 2014]. Motivated by this discrepancy, we develop an intuitive and versatile greedy-based technique that yields SSPIs directly rather than through the reduction to OOSs. Our results can be seen as generalizing and unifying a number of existing results in the area of prophet and secretary problems. Our algorithms significantly improve on the competitive guarantees for a number of interesting scenarios (including general matching with edge arrivals, bipartite matching with vertex arrivals, and certain matroids), and capture new settings (such as budget additive combinatorial auctions). Complementing our algorithmic results, we also consider mechanism design variants. Finally, we analyze the power and limitations of different SSPI approaches by providing a partial converse to the reduction from SSPI to OOS given by Azar et al.</description>

Abstract: We consider multi-layered cake cutting in order to fairly allocate numerous divisible resources (layers of cake) among a group of agents under two constraints: contiguity and feasibility. We first introduce a new computational model in a multi-layered cake named ``a pair of knives''. Then, we show the existence of an exact multi-allocation for two agents and two layers using the new computational model. We demonstrate the computation procedure of a feasible and contiguous proportional multi-allocation over a three-layered cake for more than three agents. Finally, we develop a technique for computing proportional allocations for any number $n\geq 2^a3$ of agents and $2^a3$ layers, where $a$ is any positive integer.</description>
