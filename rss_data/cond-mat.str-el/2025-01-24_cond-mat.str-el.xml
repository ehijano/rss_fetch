      <title>Field induced density wave in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the kagome lattice, electrons benefit from the simultaneous presence of band topology, flat electronic bands, and van Hove singularities, forming competing or cooperating orders. Understanding the interrelation between these distinct order parameters remains a significant challenge, leaving much of the associated physics unexplored. In the kagome superconductor KV3Sb5, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) state below T = 78 K, we uncover an unpredicted field-induced phase transition below 6 K. The observed transition is marked by a hysteretic anomaly in the resistivity, nonlinear electrical transport, and a change in the symmetry of the electronic response as probed via the angular dependence of the magnetoresistivity. These observations surprisingly suggest the emergence of an unanticipated broken symmetry state coexisting with the original CDW. To understand this experimental observation, we developed a theoretical minimal model for the normal state inside the high-temperature parent CDW phase where an incommensurate CDW order emerges as an instability sub-leading to superconductivity. The incommensurate CDW emerges when superconducting fluctuations become fully suppressed by large magnetic fields. Our results suggest that, in kagome superconductors, quantum states can either coexist or are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating that these are rich platforms to expose new correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Probing scattering of Raman phonons on magnetic and electronic excitations in pyrochlores Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic rare earth atoms on pyrochlore lattice can produce such exotic magnetic states as spin ice and quantum spin ice. These states are a result of the frustration in the pyrochlore lattice, as well as crystal field degrees of freedom of rare earth atoms, and their interactions with the lattice. Raman scattering spectroscopy, which possess high spectral resolution and can easily access broad energy and temperature ranges, is an optimum tool to study these excitations and their interactions. In this work we follow Raman scattering of zone center phonons and crystal field excitations of Nd$^{3+}$ in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ in the temperature range where these materials are paramagnetic. A comparison between an insulating Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and semimetallic Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ materials allow us to distinguish between scattering of phonons on other phonons, crystal field excitations, and electrons, highlighting interactions between these degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic suppression of the phononic thermal conductivity by magnetic field in SmAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the thermal and electrical conductivity data for the magnetic Weyl semimetal SmAlSi measured in a magnetic field (B) with two different orientations. In one case, B was applied perpendicular to the heat or charge current, in the other they were parallel. For both configurations, the magnetic field affects the magnetic structure identically as B is always parallel to the equivalent tetragonal axis. Our results indicate that phonon heat transport in response to the magnetic field exhibits strong anisotropy at low temperature: it appears to be independent of B in the perpendicular configuration but is strongly suppressed in the parallel configuration. Understanding this unusual behaviour can lead to designing better materials for thermoelectricity or directional heat switches.</description>

      <title>Giant end-tunneling effect in two distinct Luttinger liquids coexisting in one quantum wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luttinger liquids occupy a special place in physics as the most understood case of essentially quantum many-body systems. The experimental mission of measuring its main prediction, power laws in observable quantities, has already produced a body of exponents in different semiconductor and metallic structures. Here, we combine tunneling spectroscopy with density-dependent transport measurements in the same quantum wires over more than two orders of magnitude in temperature to very low temperatures down to $\sim$40 mK. This reveals that, when the second 1D subband becomes populated, the temperature dependence splits into two ranges with different exponents in the power-law dependence of the conductance, both dominated by the finite-size effect of the end-tunneling process. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the Luttinger parameters as well as the number of modes independently through spectroscopy in addition to the transport exponent in the characterization of Luttinger liquids. This opens a new pathway to unambiguous interpretation of the exponents observed in quantum wires.</description>

      <title>Emergent Polar Metal Phase in a Van der Waals Mott Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the emergence of a polar metal phase in layered van der Waals compound FePSe$_3$. This Mott insulator with antiferromagnetic order offers a unique opportunity to fully tune an insulator into a polar metal state with pressure, without doping-induced disorder or impurities. Our synchrotron and neutron diffraction data unambiguously show a structural transition and loss of the inversion symmetry. We also observed the suppression of magnetic ordering and an insulator-to-metal transition correspondent with this structural transformation. The loss of the inversion symmetry combined with the pressure-induced metallicity in FePSe$_3$ offers a new platform to investigate polar metallicity at accessible pressures. Moreover, the high-pressure metallic phase shows unconventional resistivity deviating from the Fermi-liquid description, close to the magnetic critical transition pressure at sufficiently low temperatures, which strongly suggests underlying quantum criticality. Our work not only explores the comprehensive temperature-pressure phase diagram of FePSe$_3$ but also provides insights for further investigation of van der Waals strongly correlated magnetic compounds.</description>

      <title>Disclinations, dislocations, and emanant flux at Dirac criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What happens when fermions hop on a lattice with crystalline defects? The answer depends on topological quantum numbers which specify the action of lattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. One can understand the topological quantum numbers as a twist of continuum gauge fields in terms of crystalline gauge fields. We find that disclinations and dislocations -- defects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a certain ``emanant'' quantized magnetic flux. To demonstrate these facts, we study in detail tight-binding models whose low-energy descriptions are (2+1)D Dirac cones. Our map from lattice to continuum defects explains the crystalline topological response to disclinations and dislocations, and motivates the fermion crystalline equivalence principle used in the classification of crystalline topological phases. When the gap closes, the presence of emanant flux leads to pair creation from the vacuum with the particles and anti-particles swirling around the defect. We compute the associated currents and energy density using the tools of defect conformal field theory. There is a rich set of renormalization group fixed points, depending on how particles scatter from the defect. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold leading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive numerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and we test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail. We also point out a no-go result, which implies that a single (2+1)D Dirac cone in symmetry class AII is incompatible with a commuting $C_M$ rotational symmetry with $(C_M)^M = +1$.</description>

      <title>Topological $X$-states in a quantum impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological qubits are inherently resistant to noise and errors. However, experimental demonstrations have been elusive as their realization and control is highly complex. In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of topological $X$-states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator signifying the trapping of excitations, and hence information in local edge modes.</description>

      <title>Single crystal growth of 1T-VSe$_2$ by molten salt flux method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VSe$_2$ is a highly promising van der Waals (vdW) material for applications in electronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics. Here, we report single crystal growth of 1T-VSe$_2$ by flux method using eutectic of NaCl/KCl molten salt. The typical size of as-grown VSe$_2$ single crystals is 5 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 0.1~mm$^3$. The elemental composition and homogeneity of the crystals were examined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of VSe$_2$. The crystallographic [001] direction has been determined by x-ray diffraction. Raman measurement confirms that the 1T phase of VSe$_2$ has been formed. Temperature-dependent resistivity measurement exhibits a transition around 104 K due to the formation of the charge density wave phase.</description>

      <title>Suppression of ferromagnetism in van der Waals insulator due to pressure-induced layer stacking variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External pressure suppresses the ferromagnetism of localized Cr 3d electron moments in the van der Waals insulator CrBr3, which cannot be explained without considering a dramatic pressure-induced crystal or electronic structure change. We addressed this issue by conducting a parallel experimental investigation of single crystals magnetic and structural properties using magnetization, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Ab initio DFT calculations of electronic structure and atomistic simulations of finite-temperature magnetism supported the analysis and interpretation of experimental results. The magnetization measurements at high pressures provided the first direct experimental evidence of the pressure-induced suppression of ferromagnetism. We observed a gradual decrease of the bulk magnetic moment and Curie temperature with increasing pressure, which accelerates at pressures above 3 GPa, leading to loss of ferromagnetism at 6.5 GPa. By increasing pressure, the ambient pressure phase gradually breaks down and is accompanied by the generation of layer stacking that favor the antiferromagnetic coupling of Cr moments. As a result, the appearing antiparallel pairs of moments disturb the ferromagnetic structure and reduce the bulk magnetic moment and Curie temperature. This scenario, which is well corroborated by the results of our theoretical calculations, suggests an antiferromagnetic phase emerging with increasing pressure beyond the critical value when the new single trigonal P-3m1 phase becomes stable, characterized by the "antiferromagnetic" A-A layer stacking, becomes stable. The weak coupling between adjacent magnetic layers in van der Waals materials allows variations in layering due to sufficient external forces. We hope our comprehensive study's results can help other researchers resolve frequently appearing issues of similar origin in this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, whether superconducting nickelate single crystals can be prepared at ambient pressure remains elusive. Here we report signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown from potassium carbonate flux at ambient pressure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations re-vealed high-quality single crystals with perfect stacking of trilayers. Resistivity measurements indicate that the metal-to-metal transition observed at ambient pressure was suppressed under high pressure, and a sharp drop occurred at ~30 K at 77.9 GPa, consistent with superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10 single crystals grown by the floating zone method at an oxygen pressure of &gt;18 bar. Our results not only provide an important path to prepare high-quality nickelate single crystals but also support superconductivity in nickelates under high pressure, promoting more systematic and in-depth research in this compelling field.</description>

      <title>Topological semimetal with coexisting nodal points and nodal lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Featuring exotic quantum transport and surface states, topological semimetals can be classified into nodal-point, nodal-line, and nodal-surface semimetals according to the degeneracy and dimensionality of their nodes. The coexistence of diverse categories of topological semimetals is of particular interest as it enables the concurrent utilization of their respective beneficial features. However, topological semimetals that possess both nodal points and nodal lines are rarely reported. Here, we propose a scheme to construct this unprecedented topological semimetal, which particularly exhibits second-order hinge Fermi arcs connecting projected nodal lines. Then, by applying periodic driving on the system, we find a hybrid-order topological semimetal with nodal points and rich nodal-lines structures and its conversion into the first-order topological semimetal, which are absent in the static system. Our results enrich the family of topological semimetals, thereby establishing a foundation for further exploration into the potential applications of these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is of fundamental importance to make physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, the use of mean-field Hamiltonians that lack $U(1)$ symmetry often leads to gauge-dependent results. While solutions to this problem for the linear response of conventional superconductors have been well-known, a unified understanding for unconventional superconductors or nonlinear responses has not been established. This study provides the full detail of the general theoretical framework that allows us to compute responses at arbitrary orders in external fields in a gauge-invariant manner for both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent fluctuations of order parameters method for full photon vertices and has a pictorial illustration using Feynman diagrams of the response kernel.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fermi-Hubbard model ground-state preparation by coupling to a classical reservoir in the instantaneous-response limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard model is challenging, in part due to the exponentially large Hilbert space, which complicates efficiently finding a path from an initial state to the ground state using the variational principle. In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermalization dynamics of 1D systems with local constraints coupled to an infinite temperature bath at one boundary. The coupling to the bath eventually erases the effects of the constraints, causing the system to tend towards a maximally mixed state at long times. We show that for a large class of local constraints, the time at which thermalization occurs can be extremely long. In particular, we present evidence for the following conjecture: when the constrained dynamics displays strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the thermalization time diverges exponentially with system size. We show that this conjecture holds for a wide range of dynamical constraints, including dipole-conserving dynamics, the $tJ_z$ model, and a large class of group-based dynamics, and relate a general proof of our conjecture to a different conjecture about the existence of certain expander graphs.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</title>

Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>

      <title>Pressure-dependent magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K_1$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma_1$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.46~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of 5~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K_1$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma_1$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3$ distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity beyond pairing in a Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions for flat dispersion $\varepsilon \sim k^4$, without using pairing instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. These topological chiral superconductors can be fully or partially spin-valley polarized. For partial spin-valley polarization, the ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation, neutral quasiparticles with fractional statistics, and/or gapless chiral edge states. Two of the topological chiral superconductors are in the same phases as the ``spin''-triplet or spinless $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a Weyl semimetal/spin ice interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetic pyrochlore materials, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, and geometrical frustration gives rise to exotic quantum phases, including topological semimetals and spin ice. While these phases have been observed in isolation, the interface-driven phenomena emerging from their interaction have never been realized previously. Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu2Ir2O7 and spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a six-fold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice's field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal's topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a two-fold anisotropic response indicative of a new symmetry-broken many-body state. This discovery showcases the nascent potential of complex quantum architectures in search of emergent phenomena unreachable in bulk crystals.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless region and magnetization plateaus in easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phase diagram of the bilayer triangular antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, revealing a rich interplay among geometric frustration, bilayer coupling, and symmetry-driven phenomena. High-field magnetization measurements show fractional magnetization plateaus at 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 5/6 of the saturation magnetization. To elucidate the experimental magnetic phase diagram at low fields, we propose that K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ can be described as an easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromagnet. We emphasize the critical role of the emergent $U(1) \otimes S_3$ symmetry, where $S_3 = \mathbb{Z}_3 \otimes \mathbb{Z}_2^d$, in determining the magnetic phases at low fields. The remarkable agreement between the experimental and theoretical phase diagrams suggests that the phase transitions are governed by this symmetry. Notably, our combined experimental and theoretical results identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase region at finite fields. These findings provide new insights into the phase structure of frustrated magnets and establish K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ as a compelling platform for exploring unconventional quantum phenomena in $U(1) \otimes S_3$ systems.</description>

      <title>Forecasting long-time dynamics in quantum many-body systems by dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable numerical computation of quantum dynamics is a fundamental challenge when the long-ranged quantum entanglement plays essential roles as in the cases governed by quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems. Here we apply a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior of the strongly entangled systems. We straightforwardly employ the simple dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. Despite the simplicity of the method, the effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are demonstrated, even when the time evolution at long time exhibits complicated features such as a volume-law entanglement entropy and consequential power-law decays of correlations characteristic of systems with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. The present method, though simple, enables accurate forecasts amazingly at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percentages of noise do not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.</description>

      <title>Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

      <title>Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation in molecules on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wavefunction and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with $N$ strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with $N$. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where $N$ is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wavefunction. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with ${N \choose N/2}$ Slater determinants with depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wavefunctions as initial states for several heuristic quantum algorithms, namely the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a novel QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work provides a crucial component for enabling scalable quantum simulation of classically challenging electronic systems.</description>
