      <title>Physics-Aware POD-Based Learning for Ab initio QEM-Galerkin Simulations of Periodic Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nanostructures offer crucial applications in electronics, photonics, materials, drugs, etc. For accurate design and analysis of nanostructures and materials, simulations of the Schrodinger or Schrodinger-like equation are always needed. For large nanostructures, these eigenvalue problems can be computationally intensive. One effective solution is a learning method via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), together with ab initio Galerkin projection of the Schrodinger equation. POD-Galerkin projects the problem onto a reduced-order space with the POD basis representing electron wave functions (WFs) guided by the first principles in simulations. To minimize training effort and enhance robustness of POD-Galerkin in larger structures, the quantum element method (QEM) was proposed previously, which partitions nanostructures into generic quantum elements. Larger nanostructures can then be constructed by the trained generic quantum elements, each of which is represented by its POD-Galerkin model. This work investigates QEM-Galerkin thoroughly in multi-element quantum-dot (QD) structures on approaches to further improve training effectiveness and simulation accuracy and efficiency for QEM-Galerkin. To further improve computing speed, POD and Fourier bases for periodic potentials are also examined in QEM-Galerkin simulations. Results indicate that, considering efficiency and accuracy, the POD potential basis is superior to the Fourier potential basis even for periodic potentials. Overall, QEM-Galerkin offers more than a 2-order speedup in computation over direct numerical simulation for multi-element QD structures, and more improvement is observed in a structure comprising more elements.</description>

      <title>Singular Spectrum Analysis of Time-series Data from Time-dependent density-functional theory in Real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a spectral analysis of time-seires data derived from real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). TDDFT is a robust method for obtaining molecular excited states and optical spectra by tracking the time evolution of dynamical dipole moments. However, the spectral resolution can be compromised when Fourier transformation's total time duration is insufficient. SSA enabled the extraction of specific oscillation components from the time-series data, facilitating the generation of higher-precision spectra. Even with relatively short time-series dataset, the predictive extension of SSA yielded high-resolution spectra, demonstrating substantial agreement with results obtained through conventional methods. The efficacy of this approach was validated for several small molecules, including ethylene, benzene, and others. SSA's ability to conduct detailed spectral anasysis in specific energy regions enhance spectral resolution and facilitates the clarification of oscillation components within these regions. Real-time TDDFT combined with SSA provides a new analytical method for analyzing the optical properties of molecules, significantly improving the accuracy of the analysis of emission and absorption spectra analysis. This method is expected to have various applications.</description>

      <title>Discovering dense hydrogen solid at 1200K with deep variational free energy approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform deep variational free energy calculations to investigate the dense hydrogen system at 1200 K and high pressures. In this computational framework, neural networks are used to model the free energy through the proton Boltzmann distribution and the electron wavefunction. By directly minimizing the free energy, our results reveal the emergence of a crystalline order associated with the center of mass of hydrogen molecules at approximately 180 GPa. This transition from atomic liquid to a molecular solid is marked by discontinuities in both the pressure and thermal entropy. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications and limitations of these findings in the context of recent studies of dense hydrogen under similar conditions.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of chaos in billiards: the role of mixed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system dictates its dynamics, which can be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. Despite the significant implications of chaotic billiard systems with mixed curvatures, those whose boundaries feature both positive and negative curvature remain relatively under-explored. This study introduces two such billiards: a bean-shaped billiard and a peanut-shaped billiard, the latter being a variant of Cassini ovals. Unlike traditional chaotic billiards, these systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing regions along their boundaries, with no neutral segments. We examine both classical and quantum dynamics of these billiards and observe a strong alignment between the two perspectives. For classical analysis, the billiard flow diagram and billiard map reveal sensitivity to initial conditions, a hallmark of classical chaos. In the quantum domain, we use nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and spectral complexity as statistical measures to characterise chaotic behaviour. Both classical and quantum mechanical analysis are in firm agreement with each other. One of the most striking quantum phenomena we observe is the eigenfunction scarring (both scars and super-scars). Scarring phenomena serve as a rich visual manifestation of quantum and classical correspondence, and highlight quantum suppression chaos at a local level. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chaos, especially in billiard systems with mixed curvature boundaries.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Microscale Drying of Plant-Based Foods: A Systematic Review of Computational Models and Experimental Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review examines the current state of research on microscale cellular changes during the drying of plant-based food materials (PBFM), with particular emphasis on computational modelling approaches. The review addresses the critical need for advanced computational methods in microscale investigations. We systematically analyse experimental studies in PBFM drying, highlighting their contributions and limitations in capturing cellular-level phenomena, including challenges in data acquisition and measurement accuracy under varying drying conditions. The evolution of computational models for microstructural investigations is thoroughly examined, from traditional numerical methods to contemporary state-of-the-art approaches, with specific focus on their ability to handle the complex, nonlinear properties of plant cellular materials. Special attention is given to the emergence of data-driven models and their limitations in predicting microscale cellular behaviour during PBFM drying, particularly addressing challenges in dataset acquisition and model generalization. The review provides an in-depth analysis of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) frameworks, examining their theoretical foundations, current applications in related fields, and unique advantages in combining physical principles with neural network architectures. Through this comprehensive assessment, we identify critical gaps in existing methodologies, evaluate the trade-offs between different modelling approaches, and provide insights into future research directions for improving our understanding of cellular-level transformations during PBFM drying processes. The review concludes with recommendations for integrating experimental and computational approaches to advance the field of food preservation technology.</description>

      <title>Rapid, Comprehensive Search of Crystalline Phases from X-ray Diffraction in Seconds via GPU-Accelerated Bayesian Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analysis of X-ray diffraction data, identifying the crystalline phase is important for interpreting the material. The typical method is identifying the crystalline phase from the coincidence of the main diffraction peaks. This method identifies crystalline phases by matching them as individual crystalline phases rather than as combinations of crystalline phases, in the same way as the greedy method. If multiple candidates are obtained, the researcher must subjectively select the crystalline phases. Thus, the identification results depend on the researcher's experience and knowledge of materials science. To solve this problem, we have developed a Bayesian estimation method to identify the combination of crystalline phases, taking the entire profile into account. This method estimates the Bayesian posterior probability of crystalline phase combinations by performing an approximate exhaustive search of all possible combinations. It is a method for identifying crystalline phases that takes into account all peak shapes and phase combinations. However, it takes a few hours to obtain the analysis results. The aim of this study is to develop a Bayesian method for crystalline phase identification that can provide results in seconds, which is a practical calculation time. We introduce variational sparse estimation and GPU computing. Our method is able to provide results within 10 seconds even when analysing $2^{50}$ candidate crystalline phase combinations. Furthermore, the crystalline phases identified by our method are consistent with the results of previous studies that used a high-precision algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. It has long been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent alternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of lattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing Krylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our approach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the largest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model on a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \cdot 10^3$ two-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <title>Identification of mechanisms of magnetic transitions using an efficient method for converging on first order saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for locating first order saddle points on the energy surface of a magnetic system is described and several applications presented where the mechanism of various magnetic transitions is identified. The starting point for the iterative search algorithm can be anywhere, even close to a local energy minimum representing an initial state of the system, and the final state need not be specified. Convergence on a saddle point is obtained by inverting the component of the gradient along the minimum mode, thereby effectively transforming the neighbourhood of the saddle point to that of a local minimum. The method requires only the lowest two eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the Hessian of the system's energy and they are found using a quasi-Newton limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno solver for the minimization of the Rayleigh quotient without explicit evaluation of the Hessian. The method is applicable to large systems as the computational effort scales linearly with system size. Applications are presented to transitions in systems that reveal significant complexity of co-existing magnetic states, such as skyrmions, skyrmion bags, skyrmion tubes, chiral bobbers, and globules. When combined with rate theory within the harmonic approximation, the method can be used for simulations of the long timescale dynamics of complex magnetic systems characterized by multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>The Artificial Scientist -- in-transit Machine Learning of Plasma Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing HPC cluster sizes and large-scale simulations that produce petabytes of data per run, create massive IO and storage challenges for analysis. Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages, freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU) simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady process in a continual manner. We detail challenges addressed while porting and scaling to Frontier exascale system.</description>

      <title>On the uncertainty principle of neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the inherent trade-off between accuracy and robustness in neural networks, drawing an analogy to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. We propose that neural networks are subject to an uncertainty relation, which manifests as a fundamental limitation in their ability to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. Through mathematical proofs and empirical evidence, we demonstrate that this trade-off is a natural consequence of the sharp boundaries formed between different class concepts during training. Our findings reveal that the complementarity principle, a cornerstone of quantum physics, applies to neural networks, imposing fundamental limits on their capabilities in simultaneous learning of conjugate features. Meanwhile, our work suggests that achieving human-level intelligence through a single network architecture or massive datasets alone may be inherently limited. Our work provides new insights into the theoretical foundations of neural network vulnerability and opens up avenues for designing more robust neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

      <title>Markov-type state models to describe non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When clustering molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories into a few metastable conformational states, the Markov state models (MSMs) assumption of timescale separation between fast intrastate fluctuations and rarely occurring interstate transitions is often not valid. Hence, the naive estimation of the macrostate transition matrix via simply counting transitions between the states leads to significantly too short implied timescales and thus to too fast population decays. In this work, we discuss advanced approaches to estimate the transition matrix. Assuming that Markovianity is at least given at the microstate level, we consider the Laplace-transform based method by Hummer and Szabo, as well as a direct microstate-to-macrostate projection, which by design yields correct macrostate population dynamics. Alternatively, we study the recently proposed quasi-MSM ansatz of Huang and coworkers to solve a generalized master equations, as well as a hybrid method that employs MD at short times and MSM at long times. Adopting a one-dimensional toy model and an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, we discuss the virtues and shortcomings of the various approaches.</description>

      <title>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial ``zones'' with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our ``zoned discrete axisymmetry'' (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>
