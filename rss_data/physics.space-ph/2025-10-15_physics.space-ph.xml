      <title>Loading non-Maxwellian Velocity Distributions in Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical procedures for generating non-Maxwellian velocity distributions in particle simulations are presented. First, Monte Carlo methods for an $(r,q)$ distribution that generalizes flattop and kappa distributions are discussed. Then, two rejection methods for the regularized kappa distribution are presented, followed by a comparison in the $\kappa$ space. A simple recipe is proposed for the subtracted kappa distribution. Properties and numerical recipes for the ring and shell distributions with a finite Gaussian width are discussed. The ring and shell Maxwellians are further introduced as alternatives to the ring and shell distributions. Finally, the super-Gaussian and the filled-shell distributions are presented.</description>

      <title>Polar Filaments Capture High Latitude Solar Poloidal Field Interactions and can Foretell the Future Sunspot Cycle Amplitude before Polar Field Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.</description>

      <title>A 50-min coronal kink oscillation and its possible photospheric counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coronal loop of 290~Mm length, observed at 171~\AA\ with SDO/AIA on February 6th 2024 near AR 13571, is found to oscillate with two significantly different oscillation periods, $48.8 \pm 6.1$~min and $4.8\pm 0.3$~min. The oscillations occur in the time intervals without detected flares or eruptions. Simultaneously, near the Northern footpoint of the oscillating loop, we detect a $49.6 \pm 5.0$-min periodic variation of the average projected photospheric magnetic field observed with SDO/HMI. The shorter-period decayless oscillation is attributed to the eigen-mode, standing kink oscillation of the loop, while the longer-period oscillation may be the oscillatory motion caused by the periodic footpoint driver. The photospheric long-period process can also drive the short-period, eigen oscillation of the loop via the self-oscillatory, \lq\lq violin\rq\rq\, mechanism, in which a transverse oscillation is excited by an external quasi-steady flow. This finding indicates that the most powerful, lower-frequency spectral components of photospheric motions, which are well below the Alfv\'enic/kink cutoff, can reach the corona.</description>
