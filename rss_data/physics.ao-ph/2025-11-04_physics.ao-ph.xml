      <title>IoT- and AI-informed urban air quality models for vehicle pollution monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) systems in urban environments, new opportunities are emerging to enhance real-time environmental monitoring. While most studies focus either on IoT-based air quality sensing or physics-based modeling in isolation, this work bridges that gap by integrating low-cost sensors and AI-powered video-based traffic analysis with high-resolution urban air quality models. We present a real-world pilot deployment at a road intersection in Barcelona's Eixample district, where the system captures dynamic traffic conditions and environmental variables, processes them at the edge, and feeds real-time data into a high-performance computing (HPC) simulation pipeline. Results are validated against official air quality measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Compared to traditional models that rely on static emission inventories, the IoT-assisted approach enhances the temporal granularity of urban air quality predictions of traffic-related pollutants. Using the full capabilities of an IoT-edge-cloud-HPC architecture, this work demonstrates a scalable, adaptive, and privacy-conscious solution for urban pollution monitoring and establishes a foundation for next-generation IoT-driven environmental intelligence.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Regional Thermodynamic Trends in an AI emulator, ACE2, and a hybrid model, NeuralGCM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models have emerged as potential complements to physics-based models, but their skill in capturing observed regional climate trends with important societal impacts has not been explored. Here, we benchmark satellite-era regional thermodynamic trends, including extremes, in an AI emulator (ACE2) and a hybrid model (NeuralGCM). We also compare the AI models' skill to physics-based land-atmosphere models. Both AI models show skill in capturing regional temperature trends such as Arctic Amplification. ACE2 outperforms other models in capturing vertical temperature trends in the midlatitudes. However, the AI models do not capture regional trends in heat extremes over the US Southwest. Furthermore, they do not capture drying trends in arid regions, even though they generally perform better than physics-based models. Our results also show that a data-driven AI emulator can perform comparably to, or better than, hybrid and physics-based models in capturing regional thermodynamic trends.</description>

      <title>Thermoacoustic internal gravity wave turbulence in the Earth's lower atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose, for the first time, a two-dimensional model for the nonlinear coupling of internal gravity and thermal waves in the presence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion and thermal feedback in stratified fluids of the Earth's lower atmosphere ($0-50$ km). Such a coupling gives rise to the evolution of thermoacoustic internal gravity waves (IGWs), which are distinctive from the known IGWs in the literature. We perform numerical simulations to study the nonlinear interactions of velocity and density perturbations associated with the IGWs and thermal fluctuations corresponding to the thermal mode. We show that solitary vortices of IGWs coupled to the thermal wave can lead to thermoacoustic turbulence. We observe the formation of large-scale velocity potential flows and small-scale structures in the density and temperature profiles. Interestingly, while the wave energy spectra exhibit power laws: $ k_x^{-1.67}$ and $ k_z^{-2.89}$, respectively, for horizontal and vertical wave numbers, in the troposphere ($0-15$ km) with negative temperature gradient, the same in the stratosphere ($15-50$ km) with positive temperature gradient tend to relax toward $k_x^{-1.83}$-horizontal and $k_z^{-1.03}$-vertical spectra. We find that while the energy spectra in the tropospheric turbulence are consistent with the observed phenomena without temperature gradients, those in the stratosphere differ.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the radiative response to surface temperature variability: A critical comparison of current methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, it has become clear that the radiative response to surface temperature change depends on the spatially varying structure in the temperature field, a phenomenon known as the "pattern effect". The pattern effect is commonly estimated from dedicated climate model simulations forced with local surface temperatures patches (Green's function experiments). Green's function experiments capture causal influences from temperature perturbations, but are computationally expensive to run. Recently, however, several methods have been proposed that estimate the pattern effect through statistical means. These methods can accurately predict the radiative response to temperature variations in climate model simulations. The goal of this paper is to compare methods used to quantify the pattern effect. We apply each method to the same prediction task and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Most methods indicate large negative feedbacks over the western Pacific. Over other regions, the methods frequently disagree on feedback sign and spatial homogeneity. While all methods yield similar predictions of the global radiative response to surface temperature variations driven by internal variability, they produce very different predictions from the patterns of surface temperature change in simulations forced with increasing CO2 concentrations. We discuss reasons for the discrepancies between methods and recommend paths towards using them in the future to enhance physical understanding of the pattern effect.</description>

      <title>Global Kilometer-Scale Simulations with ARP-GEM2: Effect of Parameterized Convection and Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it documents the second version of the global atmospheric model ARP-GEM and its calibration at kilometer-scale resolution. The model is currently able to run simulations at a resolution of up to 1.3 km. Second, this paper focus on multi-year global atmospheric simulations at a 2.6 km resolution with and without parameterized convection and associated calibration. Simulations without deep convection tend to be similar to those with infinite, or at least large, entrainment values. Consistently, entrainment and detrainment are used as primary drivers for the gradual reduction of convection as resolution increases. The results indicate that, with this hydrostatic model, parameterized convection still plays a significant role in the correct representation of the mean state at the kilometer scale. Additionally, they suggest some added value of high resolution in representing climate variability. However, a compromise between the adequate representation of the mean state and variability is necessary, as both are differently favored by the degree of parameterized convection. Finally, it is likely that even higher resolutions are necessary to achieve an unequivocal added value.</description>

      <title>Tipping Points and Cascading Transitions: Methods, Principles, and Evidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding tipping points and cascading transitions within the Earth system, framing them through the lens of nonlinear dynamics and complexity science. It outlines the fundamental concepts of tipping elements, large-scale subsystems like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the Amazon rainforest, and classifies tipping mechanisms into bifurcation-, noise-, and rate-induced types. The article critically evaluates methods for detecting early-warning signals, particularly those based on critical slowing down, while also acknowledging their limitations and the promise of non-conventional indicators. Furthermore, we explore the significant risk of cascading failures between interacting tipping elements, often modeled using conceptual network models. This shows that such interactions can substantially increase systemic risk under global warming. The review concludes by outlining key challenges related to data limitations and methodological robustness, and emphasizes the promising role of artificial intelligence and complex network science in advancing prediction and risk assessment of Earth system tipping dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ocean neutral transport: sub-Riemannian geometry and hypoelliptic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of water parcels in the ocean is thought to be preferentially along neutral planes defined by climatological potential temperature and salinity fields. This gives rise to a conceptual model of ocean transport in which parcel trajectories are everywhere neutral, that is, tangent to the neutral planes. Because the distribution of neutral planes is not integrable, neutral transport, while locally two dimensional, is globally three dimensional. We describe this form of transport, building on its connection with contact and sub-Riemannian geometry.
  We discuss a Lie-bracket interpretation of local dianeutral transport, the quantitative meaning of helicity and the implications of the accessibility theorem. We compute sub-Riemnanian geodesics for climatological neutral planes and put forward the use of the associated Carnot--Carath\'eodory distance as a diagnostic of the strong anisotropy of neutral transport.
  We propose a stochastic toy model of neutral transport which represents motion along neutral planes by a Brownian motion. The corresponding diffusion process is degenerate and not (strongly) elliptic. The non-integrability of the neutral planes however ensures that the diffusion is hypoelliptic. As a result, trajectories are not confined to surfaces but visit the entire three-dimensional ocean. The short-time behaviour is qualitatively different from that obtained with a non-degenerate highly anisotropic diffusion. We examine both short- and long-time behaviours using Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations provide an estimate for the time scale of ocean vertical transport implied by the constraint of neutrality.</description>

      <title>Wave Attenuation in Drifting Sea Ice: A Mechanistic Model for Observed Decay Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-sea ice interactions shape the transition zone between open ocean and pack ice in the polar regions. Most theoretical paradigms, implemented in coupled wave-sea ice models, predict exponential decay of the wave energy but recent observations deviate from this behaviour. Expanding on a framework based on wave energy dissipation due to ice-water drag, we account for drifting sea ice to derive an improved model for wave energy attenuation. Analytical solutions replicate the observed non-exponential wave energy decay and the spatial evolution of the effective attenuation rate in Antarctic sea ice.</description>

      <title>Do AI models predict storm impacts as accurately as physics-based models? A case study of the February 2020 storm series over the North Atlantic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of data-driven weather forecast models provides great promise for producing faster, computationally cheaper weather forecasts, compared to physics-based numerical models. However, while the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models have been evaluated primarily for average conditions and single extreme weather events, less is known about their capability to capture sequences of extreme events, states that are usually accompanied by multiple hazards. The storm series in February 2020 provides a prime example to evaluate the performance of AI models for storm impacts. This event was associated with high surface impacts including intense surface wind speeds and heavy precipitation, amplified regionally due to the close succession of three extratropical storms. In this study, we compare the performance of data-driven models to physics-based models in forecasting the February 2020 storm series over the United Kingdom. We show that on weekly timescales, AI models tend to outperform the numerical model in predicting mean sea level pressure (MSLP), and, to a lesser extent, surface winds. Nevertheless, certain ensemble members within the physics-based forecast system can perform as well as, or occasionally outperform, the AI models. Moreover, weaker error correlations between atmospheric variables suggest that AI models may overlook physical constraints. This analysis helps to identify gaps and limitations in the ability of data-driven models to be used for impact warnings, and emphasizes the need to integrate such models with physics-based approaches for reliable impact forecasting.</description>

      <title>Wave climate on the southwestern coast of Lake Michigan: Perspectives from wave directionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave directionality plays a critical role in shaping coastal conditions and influencing local livelihoods, underscoring the importance of conducting detailed analyses. This study examines directional wave climate along the southwestern coast of Lake Michigan from 1979 to 2023 using the Directional Wave Entropy (DWE). Directionality was characterized in terms of inter-annual trends, monthly patterns, spatial variation, and extreme wave conditions. Overall, results exhibited a strong bi-directionality, with dominant northern and southern wave systems along the coast of our study site. A few annual trends for the inter-annual wave climate were observed, and there is a clear seasonal variation such that bi-directionality increases in the summer and winter seasons. As for spatial variation of wave directionality, all locations in the study sites presented a bi-directional wave climate. The two dominant directions of wave directionality: northern and southern mean significant wave heights were also characterized in all locations of study sites as 0.566 and 0.563 meters. Furthermore, the extreme wave heights in the northern direction are significantly greater than the extreme waves in the southern direction. In summary, these findings suggest the importance of wave directionality on coastal structural design and coastal morphology management along the coast of our study site.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Data-Driven Boundary Layer Momentum Flux Parameterization for Ocean and Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary layer turbulence, particularly the vertical fluxes of momentum, shapes the evolution of winds and currents and plays a critical role in weather, climate, and biogeochemical processes. In this work, a unified, data-driven parameterization of turbulent momentum fluxes is introduced for both the oceanic and atmospheric convective boundary layers. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained offline on coarse-grained large-eddy simulation (LES) data representing a wide range of turbulent regimes in both fluids. By normalizing momentum flux profiles with their surface values, we exploit a self-similar structure across regimes and fluids, enabling joint training. The ANN learns to predict vertical profiles of subgrid momentum fluxes from mean wind or current profiles, capturing key physical features such as upgradient fluxes that are inaccessible to traditional first-order closure schemes. When implemented online in the Single Column Atmospheric Model (SCAM), the ANN parameterization consistently outperforms the SCAM baseline parameterization in replicating the evolution of the boundary layer wind profiles from the LES, especially under convective conditions, with errors reduced by a factor of 2-3 across regimes. ANN performance remains robust even when the surface momentum flux is biased up to 30\%, and generalization is confirmed by testing on LES cases excluded from the training dataset. This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning to create unified and physically consistent parameterizations across boundary layer systems in climate models.</description>

      <title>Onset of habitable conditions on the Hadean Earth set by feedback between tides and greenhouse forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the aftermath of the Moon-forming giant impact, the Hadean Earth's mantle and surface crystallized from a global magma ocean blanketed by a dense volatile-rich atmosphere. While prior studies have explored the thermal evolution of such early Earth scenarios under idealized, oxidizing conditions, the potential feedback between tidal heating driven by Earth--Moon orbital forcing and variable redox scenarios have not yet been explored in detail. We investigate whether tidal heating could have prolonged this early magma ocean phase and supported quasi-steady state epochs of global radiative equilibrium: periods of thermal balance between outgoing radiation and interior heat flux. Using the $\texttt{PROTEUS}$ simulation framework, we simulate Earth's early evolution under a range of plausible tidal power densities, oxygen fugacities, and volatile inventories. Our results suggest that feedback between tidal heating and atmospheric forcing can induce substantial variation in magma ocean lifetimes, from $\sim$30 Myr up to $\sim$500 Myr, sensitive to interior redox conditions. Global radiative equilibrium epochs commonly arise across this range, lasting from $\sim$2 to $\sim$320 Myr, and typically occur from 24 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Under oxidizing conditions, late-stage H$_2$O degassing promotes melt retention and sustained heating due to its significant contribution to greenhouse forcing. Weak tides increase the atmospheric abundance of H$_2$S and NH$_3$ and deplete CO. Therefore, the feedback between tides and atmospheric forcing induces a disequilibrium signature in the magma ocean atmosphere.</description>

      <title>OceanAI: A Conversational Platform for Accurate, Transparent, Near-Real-Time Oceanographic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming the sciences, yet general conversational AI systems often generate unverified "hallucinations" undermining scientific rigor. We present OceanAI, a conversational platform that integrates the natural-language fluency of open-source large language models (LLMs) with real-time, parameterized access to authoritative oceanographic data streams hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Each query such as "What was Boston Harbor's highest water level in 2024?" triggers real-time API calls that identify, parse, and synthesize relevant datasets into reproducible natural-language responses and data visualizations. In a blind comparison with three widely used AI chat-interface products, only OceanAI produced NOAA-sourced values with original data references; others either declined to answer or provided unsupported results. Designed for extensibility, OceanAI connects to multiple NOAA data products and variables, supporting applications in marine hazard forecasting, ecosystem assessment, and water-quality monitoring. By grounding outputs and verifiable observations, OceanAI advances transparency, reproducibility, and trust, offering a scalable framework for AI-enabled decision support within the oceans. A public demonstration is available at https://oceanai.ai4ocean.xyz.</description>

Abstract: This study presents OceanCastNet (OCN), a machine learning approach for wave forecasting that incorporates wind and wave fields to predict significant wave height, mean wave period, and mean wave direction.We evaluate OCN's performance against the operational ECWAM model using two independent datasets: NDBC buoy and Jason-3 satellite observations. NDBC station validation indicates OCN performs better at 24 stations compared to ECWAM's 10 stations, and Jason-3 satellite validation confirms similar accuracy across 228-hour forecasts. OCN successfully captures wave patterns during extreme weather conditions, demonstrated through Typhoon Goni with prediction errors typically within $\pm$0.5 m. The approach also offers computational efficiency advantages. The results suggest that machine learning approaches can achieve performance comparable to conventional wave forecasting systems for operational wave prediction applications.</description>

      <title>Ensemble reliability and the signal-to-noise paradox in large-ensemble subseasonal forecasts</title>

Abstract: Ensemble forecasts can exhibit counterintuitive statistical properties such that the correlation between ensemble means and observations ($r_{mo}$) exceeds the correlation between ensemble means and individual members ($r_{mm}$). This behaviour has been interpreted as a `signal-to-noise paradox' (SNP), which is commonly diagnosed using the ratio of predictable components ($\textnormal{RPC} = \sqrt { r_{mo}^2 / r_{mm}^2 } $). Here, we emphasise the links between SNP-like behaviour and other metrics of ensemble reliability and derive a general closed-form expression for RPC in terms of $r_{mo}$, the spread-error ratio (SER), and total variance ratio (VR). Physical constraints on the admissible solutions provide a mechanism to identify statistically paradoxical sample estimates of RPC, $r_{mo}$, SER, and VR that correspond to combinations that are not possible without sampling uncertainty. We evaluate three atmospheric circulation indices in ECMWF subseasonal reforecasts. Large-ensemble NAO forecasts evaluated over 80 start dates satisfy reliability criteria within our estimated sampling uncertainties but exhibit high RPC values at some lead times. These lead times coincide with paradoxical combinations of correlation and reliability metrics that are impossible in the large-sample limit, indicating an important role for sampling uncertainties. Nevertheless, wintertime NAO indices averaged over days 16-45 exhibit more robust evidence for unreliability characterised by $\textnormal{RPC}\approx1.5$ suggesting that SNP-like behaviour observed in daily data during the period 2001-2020 is not solely attributable to sampling artefacts. However, these results do not generalise to other configurations of the same IFS model evaluated over 3120 start dates for the period 1959-2023. In these extended reforecasts, daily NAO indices are well-calibrated and $\textnormal{RPC}\approx1$ for all lead times.</description>

      <title>The U2H map explains the effect of (sub)mesoscale currents on significant wave height statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currents modulate the energy of surface gravity waves, leading to spatial inhomogeneities in significant wave height (SWH). Previous work indicates that the overall scale of the inhomogeneities is set by the scale of the currents, that the inhomogeneities are strongly anisotropic even for isotropic currents, and that the rotational and divergent components of the currents have sharply distinct effects. We explain these and other features of current-induced SWH inhomogeneities using the U2H map, a linear relation between SWH and currents deduced from wave-action conservation by making simplifying assumptions. We obtain a linear law relating the spectrum of SWH to the spectra of rotational and divergent kinetic energy of the current. This makes it possible to relate SWH statistics (such as variance and anisotropy) to the current statistics and wave properties including directional spreading.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of Wind-Drift Currents at Mid-Latitudes</title>

Abstract: Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation in the $f$-plane approximation, we provide an exact and explicit solution of the governing equations at leading order for fluid flows in the upper layer of the ocean at mid-latitudes, driven by a wind stress. Such a solution highlights the presence of a mean Ekman current superimposed to trochoidal oscillations and a background geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>A Self-Evolving AI Agent System for Climate Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress in Earth science depends on integrating data across the planet's interconnected spheres. However, the accelerating volume and fragmentation of multi-sphere knowledge and data have surpassed human analytical capacity. This creates a major bottleneck for discovery, especially in climate science. To address this challenge, we introduce EarthLink, the first self-evolving AI agent system designed as an interactive "copilot" for Earth scientists. Through natural language interaction, EarthLink automates the entire research workflow by integrating planning, code execution, data analysis, and physical reasoning into a unified process that directly addresses this limitation. Beyond efficiency, it exhibits human-like cross-disciplinary analytical ability and achieves proficiency comparable to a junior researcher in expert evaluations on core large-scale climate tasks, including model-observation comparison and climate change understanding. When tasked with an open scientific problem, specifically the discovery of precursors of the Atlantic Ni\~no, EarthLink autonomously developed a research strategy, identified sources of predictability, verified its hypotheses with available data, and proposed a physically consistent mechanism. These emerging capabilities enable a new human-AI research paradigm. Scientists can focus on value and result judgments, while AI systems handle complex data analysis and knowledge integration. This accelerates the pace and breadth of discovery in Earth sciences. The system is accessible at our website https://earthlink.intern-ai.org.cn.</description>

      <title>Detection of isolated specular reflection for calibration of cloud thermodynamic phase estimation with quantum parametric mode sorting LIDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specular reflection can be problematic for the determination of the cloud thermodynamic phase for near-nadir-pointing space LIDARs. A LIDAR system biased towards the specular contribution for backscatter, if near-concurrent to a conventional LIDAR, could calibrate the measurements required for cloud phase determination. One such system which shows promise for this is quantum parametric mode sorting (QPMS) LIDAR. Through a non-linear interaction and time-frequency mode selectivity, this system demonstrates in-band noise-rejection beyond what linear noise filtering can provide. This level of noise-rejection means the signal strength can be minimised, therefore biasing the specular contribution to the return signal. Here we provide a theoretical model of QPMS LIDAR applied to this scenario to instruct its feasibility.</description>
