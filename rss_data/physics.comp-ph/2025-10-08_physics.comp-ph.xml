      <title>Integration of Silica in G4CMP for Phonon Simulations: Framework and Tools for Material Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting detectors with sub-eV energy resolution have demonstrated success setting limits on Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics due to their unique sensitivity to low-energy events. G4CMP, a Geant4-based extension for condensed matter physics, provides a comprehensive toolkit for modeling phonon and charge dynamics in cryogenic materials. This paper introduces a technical formalism to support the superconducting qubit and low-threshold detector community in implementing phonon simulations in custom materials into the G4CMP. As a case study, we present the results of a detailed analysis of silica phonon transport properties relevant for simulating substrate backgrounds in Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST)-style experiments using G4CMP. Additionally, Python-based tools were developed to aid users in implementing their own materials and are available on the G4CMP repository.</description>

      <title>GSM: GPU Accelerated Rare Events Sampling with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling has achieved considerable success in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of rare events. Metadynamics (MetaD), owing to its excellent compatibility with MD engines, became one of the most popular enhanced sampling methods. With the boom of GPU computing and the advent of machine learning potentials (MLPs), high-accuracy, large-scale MD simulations have gradually become feasible. However, the corresponding GPU-based enhanced sampling tools have not yet been well adapted to this progress. To enable full-life-cycle GPU MetaD simulations, we propose the GPU Sampling MetaD (GSM) package. By leveraging MLPs, it is feasible to perform high-precision rare event sampling for systems comprising millions of atoms on a typical single GPU, which offers a potential solution to many size-dependent problems. By conducting sampling in several classical systems, the results sufficiently demonstrate the capability of this package to simulate diverse atomic systems, especially efficient in large scale systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Vanishing of the Success Probability in Shor's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -&gt; infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N &lt;= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</description>

      <title>Mass Conservation on Rails -- Rethinking Physics-Informed Learning of Ice Flow Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reliably project future sea level rise, ice sheet models require inputs that respect physics. Embedding physical principles like mass conservation into models that interpolate Antarctic ice flow vector fields from sparse &amp; noisy measurements not only promotes physical adherence but can also improve accuracy and robustness. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) impose physics as soft penalties, offering flexibility but no physical guarantees, we instead propose divergence-free neural networks (dfNNs), which enforce local mass conservation exactly via a vector calculus trick. Our comparison of dfNNs, PINNs, and unconstrained NNs on ice flux interpolation over Byrd Glacier suggests that "mass conservation on rails" yields more reliable estimates, and that directional guidance, a learning strategy leveraging continent-wide satellite velocity data, boosts performance across models.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian neural ODEs: Measuring the existence of a Lagrangian with Helmholtz metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.</description>

      <title>Phase segregation of liquid-vapor systems with a gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in the presence of external forces has attracted
  considerable attention since the initial works for solid mixtures.
  Despite this, only very few studies are available which address
  the segregation process of liquid-vapor systems under gravity.
  We present here an extensive study which takes into account both
  hydrodynamic and gravitational effects on the coarsening dynamics.
  An isothermal formulation of a lattice Boltzmann model for a liquid-vapor
  system with the van der Waals equation of state is adopted.
  In the absence of gravity, the growth of domains follows a power law
  with the exponent $2/3$ of the inertial regime.
  The external force deeply affects the observed morphology
  accelerating the coarsening of domains and favoring the liquid accumulation
  at the bottom of the system. Along the force direction,
  the growth exponent is found to increase with the gravity strength
  still preserving sharp interfaces since the Porod's law is found to be
  verified.
  The time evolution of the average thickness $L$
  of the layers of accumulated material at confining walls
  shows a transition from an initial regime where $L \simeq t^{2/3}$
  ($t$: time) to a late-time regime $L \simeq g t^{5/3}$ with $g$ the
  gravitational acceleration.
  The final steady state, made of two overlapped layers of liquid and
  vapor, shows a density profile in agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Molecular Single-Photon Emitters: A Materials-Modelling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extension to the effective average-atom (AA) interatomic potential (IP) that accounts for local ordering effects is derived. While the AA approach is only valid for random alloys, the new local-order average-atom (LOAA) IP accounts for short-range order within a material by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. Simulations with a LOAA potential require smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore can be used to model complex materials where short-range order effects are important, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs. The method is validated for a two-dimensional (2D) binary hexagonal crystal with Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions, and for three-dimensional (3D) Fe$_{(1-x)/2}$Ni$_{(1-x)/2}$Cr$_x$ and Ni$_{0.67}$Al$_{0.33}$ alloys modeled via embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials. For the 2D crystal we obtain a local ordering phase diagram in terms of the LJ parameters and demonstrate that in all cases the LOAA formulation obtains elastic properties that match the true-species case using standard IPs. The 3D alloy examples further demonstrate the ability of this method to accurately capture other material properties and phase transformations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking AI-evolved cosmological structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of deep learning-based image-to-image translations has recently attracted significant attention. One possible application of such a framework is as a fast, approximate alternative to cosmological simulations, which would be particularly useful in various contexts, including covariance studies, investigations of systematics, and cosmological parameter inference. To investigate different aspects of learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose two approaches for generating suitable cosmological matter fields as datasets: a simple analytical prescription provided by the Zel'dovich approximation, and a numerical N-body method using the Particle-Mesh approach. The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes -- such as the density-weighted loss used here -- to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Linear Systems Pathway for Solving Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic pathway for solving differential equations within the quantum linear systems framework by combining block encoding with Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The approach is demonstrated on a complex tridiagonal linear system and extended to problems in computational fluid dynamics: the heat equation with mixed boundary conditions and the nonlinear Burgers' equation. Our scaling analysis of the heat equation shows how discretization influences the minimum singular value and the polynomial degree required for QSVT, identifying circuit-depth overhead as a key bottleneck. For Burgers' equation, we illustrate how Carleman-linearized nonlinear dynamics can be efficiently block encoded and solved within the QSVT framework. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of current methods, underscoring the need for efficient estimation of minimum singular value, depth-reduction techniques, and benchmarks against classical reachability. This pathway lays a foundation for advancing quantum linear system methods toward large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Universal initial state preparation for first quantized quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing symmetry-adapted initial states is a principal bottleneck in first-quantized quantum simulation. We present a universal approach that efficiently maps any polynomial-size superposition of occupation-number configurations to the first-quantized representation on a digital quantum computer. The method exploits the Jordan--Schwinger Lie algebra homomorphism, which identifies number-conserving second-quantized operators with their first-quantized action and induces an equivariant bijection between Fock occupations and $\mathfrak{su}(d)$ weight states within the Schur--Weyl decomposition. Operationally, we prepare an encoded superposition of Schur labels via a block-encoded linear combination of unitaries and then apply the inverse quantum Schur transform. The algorithm runs in time $\text{poly}(L, N, d, \log \epsilon^{-1})$ for $L$ configurations of $N$ particles over $d$ modes to accuracy $\epsilon$, and applies universally to fermions, bosons, and Green's paraparticles in arbitrary single-particle bases. Resource estimates indicate practicality within leading first-quantized pipelines; statistics-aware or faster quantum Schur transforms promise further reductions.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Quantum Algorithm for Topology Optimization in Structural Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space, evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work, we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-B\"olkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving MHD-Driftkinetic Discretization for Wave-Particle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structure-preserving discretization of the hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-driftkinetic system for simulations of low-frequency wave-particle interactions. The model equations are derived from a variational principle, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and driftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a finite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a particle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme is the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in the Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The resulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into skew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the non-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based on discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python package $\texttt{STRUPHY}$. Numerical experiments confirm the energy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to simulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This capability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for high-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Aeroacoustic Shape Optimization at Low Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of gradient-free aeroacoustic shape optimization using the Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach to study two-dimensional flow at low Reynolds numbers. The Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) is computed via the direct acoustic approach, and optimization is performed using the gradient-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm. The proposed framework is assessed across three problems. First, flow over an open cavity is investigated at a Reynolds number of $Re=1500$ and free-stream Mach number of $M_\infty = 0.15$, resulting in a $7.9dB$ noise reduction. The second case considers tandem cylinders at $Re=200$ and $M_\infty = 0.2$, achieving a $16.5 dB$ noise reduction by optimizing the distance between the cylinders and their diameter ratio. Finally, a NACA0012 airfoil is optimized at $Re=10,000$ and $M_\infty = 0.2$ to reduce trailing edge noise. The airfoil's shape is optimized to generate a new 4-digit NACA airfoil at an appropriate angle of attack to reduce OASPL while maintaining the baseline time-averaged lift coefficient and preventing an increase in the baseline time-averaged drag coefficient. The optimized airfoil is silent at $0dB$ and the drag coefficient is decreased by $24.95\%$. These results demonstrate the feasibility of shape optimization using MADS and FR for aeroacoustic design.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Fokker-Planck PDEs</title>

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The state uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF. Our main contribution is the analysis of PINN approximation error: we develop a theoretical framework to construct tight error bounds using PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with standard training methods. We discuss that this error-bound framework generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Empirical results on nonlinear, high-dimensional, and chaotic systems validate the correctness of our error bounds while demonstrating the scalability of PINNs and their significant computational speedup in obtaining accurate PDF solutions compared to the Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Ideal Vortex Flows Using the Differentiable Vortex Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17012</link>

Abstract: Vortex flows are ubiquitous in both natural processes and engineering applications, including phenomena such as typhoons, water currents, and aerospace fluid dynamics. The vortex particle method, a computational approach grounded in vortex dynamics, has been extensively applied in aerodynamics, oceanography, turbulence, and aeroacoustics. With the recent introduction of machine learning into computational fluid dynamics, a hybrid framework known as the differentiable vortex particle method (DVPM) has been proposed, which integrates the vortex particle method with deep learning to enable efficient learning and prediction. However, the original formulation of DVPM is limited to ideal vortex flow conditions, such as inviscid flows without non-conservative body forces, which significantly restricts its practical applicability. In this study, we extend the differentiable vortex particle method beyond idealized flow scenarios to encompass more realistic, non-ideal conditions, including viscous flow and flow subjected to non-conservative body forces. We establish the Lamb-Oseen vortex as a benchmark case, representing a fundamental viscous vortex flow in fluid mechanics. This selection offers significant analytical advantages, as the Lamb-Oseen vortex possesses an exact analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, thereby providing definitive ground truth data for training and validation purposes. Through rigorous evaluation across a spectrum of Reynolds numbers, we demonstrate that DVPM achieves superior accuracy in modeling the Lamb-Oseen vortex compared to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our results substantiate DVPM's robust capabilities in modeling non-ideal vortex flows, establishing its distinct advantages over contemporary deep learning methodologies in fluid dynamics applications.</description>

      <title>Performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>
