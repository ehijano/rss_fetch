      <title>BO-SA-PINNs: Self-adaptive physics-informed neural networks based on Bayesian optimization for automatically designing PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is becoming a popular alternative method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they require dedicated manual modifications to the hyperparameters of the network, the sampling methods and loss function weights for different PDEs, which reduces the efficiency of the solvers. In this paper, we pro- pose a general multi-stage framework, i.e. BO-SA-PINNs to alleviate this issue. In the first stage, Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to select hyperparameters for the training process, and based on the results of the pre-training, the network architecture, learning rate, sampling points distribution and loss function weights suitable for the PDEs are automatically determined. The proposed hyperparameters search space based on experimental results can enhance the efficiency of BO in identifying optimal hyperparameters. After selecting the appropriate hyperparameters, we incorporate a global self-adaptive (SA) mechanism the second stage. Using the pre-trained model and loss information in the second-stage training, the exponential moving average (EMA) method is employed to optimize the loss function weights, and residual-based adaptive refinement with distribution (RAR-D) is used to optimize the sampling points distribution. In the third stage, L-BFGS is used for stable training. In addition, we introduce a new activation function that enables BO-SA-PINNs to achieve higher accuracy. In numerical experiments, we conduct comparative and ablation experiments to verify the performance of the model on Helmholtz, Maxwell, Burgers and high-dimensional Poisson equations. The comparative experiment results show that our model can achieve higher accuracy and fewer iterations in test cases, and the ablation experiments demonstrate the positive impact of every improvement.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Expert Opinion from Social Media for Stock Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While stock prediction task traditionally relies on volume-price and fundamental data to predict the return ratio or price movement trend, sentiment factors derived from social media platforms such as StockTwits offer a complementary and useful source of real-time market information. However, we find that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they reflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy nature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm that filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse experts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our approach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification methods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert predictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert identification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal sparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations in our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention neural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related stocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly increasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated expert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but also work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined signals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all quant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and correlation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies. We hope this work inspires further research into leveraging social media data for enhancing quantitative investment strategies.

      <title>Corrosion of metal reinforcements within concrete and localisation of supporting reactions under natural conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corrosion in concrete prevents in-situ observation, necessitating models to provide insight into the local reaction currents. We present a computational method for predicting corrosion rates of reinforcements within concrete under natural conditions, i.e. requiring the corrosion current to be supported by equal cathodic currents. In contrast to typical corrosion models, where these two counteracting currents are required to be co-located, we allow these currents to be separated such that pitting corrosion can be supported by cathodic reactions over a much larger area. Pitting corrosion is investigated, elucidating the effects of the concrete porosity and water saturation, the presence of dissolved oxygen, and chlorine concentration within the pore solution. The presented model is capable of capturing the dynamic growth of acidic regions around corrosion pits, showing the limited region over which the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs and how this region evolves over time. The ability of oxygen to diffuse towards the metal surface due to increased porosity is seen to have a major effect on the corrosion rate, whereas changes in the chlorine concentration (and thus changes in the conductivity of the pore solution) play a secondary role. Furthermore, external oxygen is seen to enhance corrosion but is not required to initialise and sustain acidic corrosion pits.</description>

      <title>Analogical Learning for Cross-Scenario Generalization: Framework and Application to Intelligent Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing learning models often exhibit poor generalization when deployed across diverse scenarios. It is mainly due to that the underlying reference frame of the data varies with the deployment environment and settings. However, despite the data of each scenario has its distinct reference frame, its generation generally follows the same underlying physical rule. Based on these findings, this article proposes a brand-new universal deep learning framework named analogical learning (AL), which provides a highly efficient way to implicitly retrieve the reference frame information associated with a scenario and then to make accurate prediction by relative analogy across scenarios. Specifically, an elegant bipartite neural network architecture called Mateformer is designed, the first part of which calculates the relativity within multiple feature spaces between the input data and a small amount of embedded data from the current scenario, while the second part uses these relativity to guide the nonlinear analogy. We apply AL to the typical multi-scenario learning problem of intelligent wireless localization in cellular networks. Extensive experiments show that AL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, stable transferability and robust adaptation to new scenarios without any tuning, and outperforming conventional methods with a precision improvement of nearly two orders of magnitude. All data and code are available at https://github.com/ziruichen-research/ALLoc.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cognitive Attributes in Financial Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive attributes are fundamental to metacognition, shaping how individuals process information, evaluate choices, and make decisions. To develop metacognitive artificial intelligence (AI) models that reflect human reasoning, it is essential to account for the attributes that influence reasoning patterns and decision-maker behavior, often leading to different or even conflicting choices. This makes it crucial to incorporate cognitive attributes in designing AI models that align with human decision-making processes, especially in high-stakes domains such as finance, where decisions have significant real-world consequences. However, existing AI alignment research has primarily focused on value alignment, often overlooking the role of individual cognitive attributes that distinguish decision-makers. To address this issue, this paper (1) analyzes the literature on cognitive attributes, (2) establishes five criteria for defining them, and (3) categorizes 19 domain-specific cognitive attributes relevant to financial decision-making. These three components provide a strong basis for developing AI systems that accurately reflect and align with human decision-making processes in financial contexts.</description>

      <title>Exponential Shift: Humans Adapt to AI Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are transforming the global labor market. Human workers, limited to a 33% duty cycle due to rest and holidays, cost $14 to $55 per hour. In contrast, digital labor operates nearly 24/7 at just $0.10 to $0.50 per hour. We examine sectors like healthcare, education, manufacturing, and retail, finding that 40-70% of tasks could be automated. Yet, human skills like emotional intelligence and adaptability remain essential. Humans process 5,000-20,000 tokens (units of information) per hour, while AI far exceeds this, though its energy use-3.5 to 7 times higher than humans-could offset 20-40% of cost savings. Using real-world examples, such as AI in journalism and law, we illustrate these dynamics and propose six strategies-like a 4-day workweek and retraining-to ensure a fair transition to an AI-driven economy.</description>

      <title>Causal integration of chemical structures improves representations of microscopy images for morphological profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have improved our ability to quantify cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens, a process known as morphological profiling. However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing wheel loader performance -- an end-to-end approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wheel loaders in mines and construction sites repeatedly load soil from a pile to load receivers. This task presents a challenging optimization problem since each loading's performance depends on the pile state, which depends on previous loadings. We investigate an end-to-end optimization approach considering future loading outcomes and transportation costs between the pile and load receivers. To predict the evolution of the pile state and the loading performance, we use world models that leverage deep neural networks trained on numerous simulated loading cycles. A look-ahead tree search optimizes the sequence of loading actions by evaluating the performance of thousands of action candidates, which expand into subsequent action candidates under the predicted pile states recursively. Test results demonstrate that, over a horizon of 15 sequential loadings, the look-ahead tree search is 6% more efficient than a greedy strategy, which always selects the action that maximizes the current single loading performance, and 14% more efficient than using a fixed loading controller optimized for the nominal case.</description>

      <title>A reduced 3D-0D FSI model of the aortic valve including leaflet curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.00571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative lumped-parameter model of the aortic valve, designed to efficiently simulate the impact of valve dynamics on blood flow. Our reduced model includes the elastic effects associated with the leaflets' curvature and the stress exchanged with the blood flow. The introduction of a lumped-parameter model based on momentum balance entails an easier calibration of the model parameters: phenomenological-based models, on the other hand, typically have numerous parameters. This model is coupled to 3D Navier-Stokes equations describing the blood flow, where the moving valve leaflets are immersed in the fluid domain by a resistive method. A stabilized finite element method with a BDF time scheme is adopted for the discretization of the coupled problem, and the computational results show the suitability of the system in representing the leaflet motion, the blood flow in the ascending aorta, and the pressure jump across the leaflets. Both physiological and stenotic configurations are investigated, and we analyze the effects of different treatments for the leaflet velocity on the blood flow.</description>

      <title>GeOT: A spatially explicit framework for evaluating spatio-temporal predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When predicting observations across space and time, the spatial layout of errors impacts a model's real-world utility. For instance, in bike sharing demand prediction, error patterns translate to relocation costs. However, commonly used error metrics in GeoAI evaluate predictions point-wise, neglecting effects such as spatial heterogeneity, autocorrelation, and the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. We put forward Optimal Transport (OT) as a spatial evaluation metric and loss function. The proposed framework, called GeOT, assesses the performance of prediction models by quantifying the transport costs associated with their prediction errors. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that 1) the spatial distribution of prediction errors relates to real-world costs in many applications, 2) OT captures these spatial costs more accurately than existing metrics, and 3) OT enhances comparability across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we advocate for leveraging OT as a loss function in neural networks to improve the spatial accuracy of predictions. Experiments with bike sharing, charging station, and traffic datasets show that spatial costs are significantly reduced with only marginal changes to non-spatial error metrics. Thus, this approach not only offers a spatially explicit tool for model evaluation and selection, but also integrates spatial considerations into model training.
