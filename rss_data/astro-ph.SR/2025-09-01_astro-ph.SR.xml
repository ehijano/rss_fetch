      <title>Detection of a white dwarf orbiting a Carbon-Oxygen depleted blue straggler in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have employed deep far-UV observations secured with the Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to search for hot companions to five blue stragglers stars (BSSs) showing significant surface depletion of carbon (C) and oxygen (O), in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Such a chemical pattern has been interpreted as the chemical signature of the mass transfer formation process for the observed blue stragglers. The mass transfer origin is also expected to leave a "photometric signature" in the form of a UV-excess, as the stripped core of the donor star should be observable as a white dwarf (WD) companion orbiting the newborn BSS. We found strong evidence for the presence of a hot (T &gt; 20000 K) WD companion to one of the investigated BSS, indicating that it likely formed through mass transfer less than 12 Myr ago. This is the first simultaneous evidence of the chemical and the photometric signatures of the mass-transfer formation channel. The lack of evidence for a hot companion to the other investigated blue stragglers is consistent with the expectation that the photometric signature (as well as the chemical one) is a transient phenomenon.</description>

      <title>The fate of rotating massive stars across cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the extremely long-period cataclysmic variables V479 Andromedae and V1082 Sagitarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overwhelming majority of CVs have orbital periods shorter than 10 hr. However, a few have much longer periods, and their formation and existence pose challenges for the CV evolution models. These extremely long-period CVs must host nuclearly evolved donor stars, as otherwise, the companion of the white dwarf would be too small to fill its Roche lobe. This makes them natural laboratories for testing binary evolution models and accretion processes with subgiant donors. To shed light on the formation and evolution of accreting compact objects with subgiant companions, we investigated two extremely long-period CVs in detail, namely V479 And and V1082 Sgr. We searched for reasonable formation pathways to explain their refined stellar and binary parameters. We used a broad set of new observations, including ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, results of circular polarimetry, and improved Gaia distance estimates to determine fundamental parameters to be confronted with numerical simulations. Furthermore, we utilized the MESA code to conduct numerical simulations, employing state-of-the-art prescriptions, such as the CARB model for strong magnetic braking. Both systems have unusual chemical compositions and very low masses for their assigned spectral classes. This most likely indicates that they underwent thermal timescale mass transfer. We found models for both that can reasonably reproduce their properties. We conclude that the donor stars in both V479 And and V1082 Sgr are filling their Roche lobes. Our findings suggest that orbital angular momentum loss is stronger due to magnetic braking in CVs with subgiant donors compared to those with unevolved donors. In addition, our findings suggest that extremely long-period CVs could significantly contribute to the population of double white dwarf binaries in close orbits.</description>

      <title>Refining fundamental constants with white dwarfs: machine learning informed constraints on fine-structure constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential variation of two fundamental constants, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$, within the framework of modified gravity theories and finite-temperature effects. Utilising high-precision white dwarf observations from the Gaia-DR3 survey, we construct a robust mass--radius relation using a Bayesian-inspired machine learning framework. This empirical relation is rigorously compared with theoretical predictions derived from scalar-tensor gravity models and temperature-dependent equations of state. Our results demonstrate that both underlying gravitational theory and temperature substantially influence the inferred constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$. We obtain the strongest constraints as $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=2.10^{+32.56}_{-39.26}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.61^{+37.16}_{-34.67}\times10^{-7}$ for modified gravity parameter $\gamma\simeq -3.69\times10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$, while for the finite temperature case, these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=1.60^{+37.31}_{-35.42}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.23^{+37.02}_{-35.71}\times10^{-7}$ for $T \simeq 1.1 \times 10^7\rm\, K$. These findings yield tighter constraints than those reported in earlier studies and underscore the critical roles of gravitational and thermal physics in testing the constancy of fundamental parameters.</description>

      <title>Astrophotometric search for massive stars in the Milky way. Confronting Random Forest predictions with available spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars play a significant role in different branches of astronomy, from shaping the processes of star and planet formation to influencing the evolution and chemical enrichment of the distant universe. Despite their high astrophysical significance, these objects are rare and difficult to detect. With Gaia's advent, we now possess extensive kinematic and photometric data for a significant portion of the Galaxy that can unveil, among others, new populations of massive star candidates. In order to produce bonafide bright (G magnitude $&lt;$ 12) massive star candidate lists (threshold set to spectral type B2 or earlier but slight changes in this threshold also explored) in the Milky Way subject to be followed up by future massive spectroscopic surveys, we have developed a Gaia DR3 plus literature data based methodology. We trained a Balanced Random Forest (BRF) with the spectral types from the compilation by Skiff et al. (2014) as labels. Our approach yields a completeness of $\sim80\%$ and a purity ranging from $0.51 \pm 0.02$ for probabilities between 0.6 and 0.7, up to $0.85 \pm 0.05$ for the 0.9-1.0 range. To externally validate our methodology, we searched for and analyzed archival spectra of moderate to high probability (p $&gt;$ 0.6) candidates that are not contained in our catalog of labels. Our independent spectral validation confirms the expected performance of the BRF, spectroscopically classifying 300 stars as B3 or earlier (due to observational constraints imposed in the B0-3 range), including 107 new stars. Based on the most conservative yields of our methodology, our candidate list could increase the number of bright massive stars by $\sim$50\%. As a byproduct, we developed an automatic methodology for spectral typing optimized for LAMOST spectra, based on line detection and characterization guiding a decision path.</description>

      <title>Recovering Signals in CoRoT Mission (RSCoRoT): I. Short Period Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CoRoT (Convection, Rotation, and planetary Transits) mission still holds a large trove of high-quality, underused light curves with excellent signal-to-noise and continuous coverage. This paper, the first in a series, identifies and classifies variable stars in CoRoT fields whose variability has not been analyzed in the main repositories. We combine simulations and real data to test a moving-average scheme that mitigates instrumental jumps and enhances the recovery of short-period signals (&lt;1 day) in roughly 20-day time series. For classification, we adopt a supervised selection built on features extracted from folded light curves using the double period, and we construct template-based models that also act as a new classifier for well-sampled light curves. We report 9,272 variables, of which 6,249 are not listed in SIMBAD or VSX. Our preliminary classes include 309 Beta Cephei, 3,105 Delta Scuti, 599 Algol-type eclipsing binaries, 844 Beta Lyrae eclipsing binaries, 497 W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binaries, 1,443 Gamma Doradus, 63 RR Lyrae, and 32 T Tauri stars. The resulting catalog inserts CoRoT variables into widely used astronomical repositories. Comparing sources in the inner and outer Milky Way, we find significant differences in the occurrence of several classes, consistent with metallicity and age gradients. The ability to recover sub-day periods also points to automated strategies for detecting longer-period variability, which we will develop in subsequent papers of this series.</description>

      <title>New line-driven wind mass-loss rates for OB stars with metallicities down to $0.01\,Z_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new line-driven wind models for OB stars with metallicities down to $0.01\,Z_\odot$. The models were calculated with our global wind code METUJE, which solves the hydrodynamical equations from nearly hydrostatic photosphere to supersonically expanding stellar wind together with the equations of statistical equilibrium and the radiative transfer equation. The models predict the basic wind parameters, namely, the wind mass-loss rates and terminal velocities just from the stellar parameters. In general, the wind mass-loss rates decrease with decreasing metallicity and this relationship steepens for very low metallicities, $Z\lesssim0.1\,Z_\odot$. Down to metallicities corresponding to the Magellanic Clouds and even lower, the predicted mass-loss rates reasonably agree with observational estimates. However, the theoretical and observational mass-loss rates for very low metallicities exhibit significant scatter. We show that the scatter of observational values can be caused by inefficient shock cooling in the stellar wind, which leaves a considerable fraction of the wind at too high temperatures with waning observational signatures. The scatter of theoretical predictions is caused by a low number of lines that effectively accelerate the wind at very low metallicities.</description>

      <title>Alfven wave propagation from the photosphere to the corona: temporal evolution against stationary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have confirmed that a significant fraction of the coronal Alfvenic wave spectrum originates in the photosphere. These waves travel from the photosphere to the corona, overcoming the barriers of reflection and dissipation posed by the chromosphere. Previous studies have theoretically calculated the chromospheric reflection, transmission, and absorption coefficients for pure Alfven waves under the assumption of stationary propagation. Here, we relax that assumption and investigate the time-dependent propagation of Alfven waves driven at the photosphere. Using an idealized chromospheric background model, we compare the coefficients obtained from time-dependent simulations with those derived under the stationary approximation. Additionally, we examine the impact of the spatial resolution in the numerical simulations. Considering a spatial resolution of 250 m, we find that the time-dependent transmission coefficient converges to the stationary value across the entire frequency range after only a few chromospheric Alfven crossing times, while the reflectivity displays a good convergence for frequencies lower than 30 mHz. The absorption coefficient also converges for wave frequencies above 1 mHz, for which chromospheric dissipation is significant. In contrast, at lower frequencies, wave energy dissipation is weak and the time-dependent simulations typically overestimate the absorption. Inadequate spatial resolution artificially enhances the chromospheric reflectivity, reduces wave transmission to the corona, and poorly describes the wave energy absorption. Overall, the differences between the stationary and time-dependent approaches are only minor and gradually decrease as spatial resolution and simulation time increase, which reinforces the validity of the stationary approximation.</description>

      <title>Gaia's promise to detect compact-object binaries: where we stand with the third data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With its third data release (DR3), Gaia begins unveiling dormant candidate compact object (CO) binaries with luminous companion (LC) as predicted by several past theoretical studies. To date, 3 black hole (BH), 21 neutron star (NS), and ~3200 white dwarf (WD) candidates have been identified with LCs in detached orbits using astrometry. We adopt an observationally motivated sampling scheme for the star formation history of the Milky Way, and initial zero-age main-sequence binary properties, incorporate all relevant binary interaction processes during evolution to obtain a realistic present-day intrinsic population of CO--LC binaries. We apply Gaia's selection criteria to identify the CO--LC binaries detectable using the observational cuts applicable for DR3 as well as its end-of-mission (EOM). We find that under the DR3 selection cuts, our detectable population includes no BH--LCs, approximately 10-40 NS--LCs, and around ~4300 WD--LCs. In contrast, by EOM, the expected numbers increase to 30-300 BH--LCs, 1500-5000 NS--LCs, and ~10^5-10^6 WD--LC binaries, primarily because of the significantly longer baseline of observation.</description>

      <title>Fates of Rotating Supergiants from Stellar Mergers and the Landscape of Transients upon Core-collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a grid of rotating supergiant models from post-main sequence binary merger products, constructed by the MESA stellar evolution code. We focus on the evolution of these stars until core-collapse, in addition to their rotation, which could influence their mass loss and explosion phenomenology. We find that (i) as in previous studies, larger mass gain by merger favors the production of blue supergiants (BSGs) over red supergiants, and (ii) merger products that end as BSGs at core collapse have rotating outer envelopes, with lower-mass BSGs having faster envelope rotation due to less wind mass loss. We model the expected transients from these BSGs upon core-collapse, considering cases where the neutrino-driven explosion is successful and unsuccessful. The successful explosions result in supernovae (SNe) with long-rising light curves of morphology similar to SN 1987A. Failed explosions of these BSGs result in envelope fallback of $\sim (0.1$- several) $~M_\odot$ over $10^3$-$10^5$ seconds that power strong ($10^{51}$-$10^{53}$ erg) accretion-driven outflows in winds and possibly jets, with relativistic jets (if formed) generally capable of breaking out of the BSG envelope. Our modeling points to these merger-origin BSGs as viable progenitors for SN 1987A-like SNe, ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, and some of the fast luminous transients found in high-cadence optical surveys.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Reconnection and it's Dynamical Role in 2D Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs material transport and mixing in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas under the influence of gravity and magnetic fields. While magnetic reconnection is known to occur during MRTI evolution, its role in the evolution and energy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of reconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution simulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger, relieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an essential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the role of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated reconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a range of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to $80\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field regime, while contributing minimally ($\approx 3\%$) to magnetic energy dissipation. Our results establish magnetic reconnection as a critical mechanism that regulates large-scale MRTI dynamics, with implications for astrophysical plasmas and turbulent mixing in magnetized flows.</description>

      <title>Response of Ionospheric Total Electron Content to the Impulsive and Late Phases of X-Class Solar Flares with Various Center-to-Limb Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During a solar flare, the fluxes in various lines and continua of the solar spectrum increase, leading to enhanced ionization of the illuminated part of the Earth's ionosphere and an increase in the total electron content (TEC). It has been previously shown that nearly 50% of X-class solar flares exhibit a second peak in warm coronal lines, such as FeXV and FeXVI (called the 'EUV late phase'), the effect of which on the ionosphere remains largely unexplored. This study presents an analysis of the ionospheric response to 14 X-class flares with pronounced late phases. For the first time, empirical relationships between the increase in TEC and the solar flux enhancement during the impulsive and late phases of the flare are derived. Additionally, we demonstrate the influence of flare location on the intensity of geoeffective solar spectral lines and the ratio of the ionospheric responses to the impulsive and late phases of solar flares.</description>

      <title>A compact Keplerian-like disc and H30$\alpha$ emission towards the radio jet in the massive protostar W75N(B)-VLA3</title>

Abstract: Studying young, high-mass stellar objects is challenging for testing models of massive star formation due to their great distances, often kiloparsecs away. This requires extremely high-angular resolution to resolve features like accretion discs around massive protostars. Consequently, while powerful, collimated outflows are evident in massive protostars, the compact accretion discs anticipated at their centres are still proving difficult to pinpoint. This study presents ALMA continuum and molecular line observations at 1.3 mm of the massive protostar W75N(B)-VLA3. The observations achieve an angular resolution of $\sim$0.12$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$156 au). Dense gas tracers reveal a circumstellar disc of $\sim$450 au in radius surrounding VLA3, with an orientation perpendicular to its associated thermal radio jet. From the millimetre continuum, a total mass of $\approx$0.43-1.74 $M_\odot$ is estimated for the disc. The disc's velocity profile is consistent with Keplerian rotation around a protostar of $\approx$16 $M_\odot$. This adds VLA3 to the small number of massive disc-protostar-jet systems documented in the literature with a centrifugally supported disc with a radius less than 500 au. Additionally, we detected H30$\alpha$ recombination line emission towards the radio jet powered by VLA3. Despite limitations in the spatial and spectral resolution, our data reveal a very broad line, indicative of high-velocity motions, as well as a tentative velocity gradient in the jet's direction, thus favouring the H30$\alpha$ emission to originate from the radio jet. Should this interpretation be confirmed with new observations, W75N(B)-VLA3 could represent the first protostellar radio jet for which a thermal radio recombination line has been detected.</description>

      <title>Neutron Dark Decay in Neutron Stars: The Role of the Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of the influence of the nuclear symmetry energy on the proposed neutron decay into dark matter particles within the cores of neutron stars. Unlike the majority of previous studies that considered only pure neutron matter, the present analysis is extended to encompass $\beta$-stable nuclear matter. Furthermore, in relation to previous studies, the interactions between dark matter and baryons are incorporated and systematically studied regarding their effect on the structure of neutron stars. Our findings indicate that the nuclear symmetry energy plays a critical role in shaping the total equation of state (EoS) for dense neutron star matter containing dark sector components. The strength of interactions among dark matter particles, as well as between dark matter and baryons, is shown to be pivotal in determining both the composition and the macroscopic properties of neutron stars. The concurrent tuning of interaction strengths alongside the symmetry energy parameters may facilitate a more accurate reproduction of recent observational data relevant to neutron star properties. In any case, the extent to which the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme conditions prevailing in the interior of neutron stars remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>47 Tuc in Rubin Data Preview 1: Exploring Early LSST Data and Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analyses of the early data from Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1) for the globular cluster 47 Tuc field. The DP1 dataset for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands ($ugriy$). We address challenges of crowding in the inner region of the cluster and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, of the 72 well-characterized variables in the field, we recover five known variable stars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries, in the coadd-based object catalog, and identify 62 in the difference image-based object catalog. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbits around a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-global monopole spacetime in a homogeneous magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of charged particles in the spacetime of a global monopole swallowed by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole in the presence of an external, weak, asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field. We carefully analyze and deduce the conditions to have such a magnetic field around this black hole and show that this is indeed possible in the small but nontrivial charge and monopole term limit. We obtain the general equations of motion and analyze them for special cases of circular orbits, focusing on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of this configuration. The richness of the parameters and complicated forms of the resulting equations of motion necessitate a numerical approach. Hence, we have presented our results with numerous graphs, which help to understand the evolution of ISCO as a function of the external test magnetic field and the monopole term, depending on the parameters of the black hole, such as its electric charge, as well as the properties of the test particle, such as its specific charge, angular momentum, and energy. We have also analyzed the effective potential that these fields generate and deduced results for the aforementioned values of the external and internal parameters of the spacetime.</description>

      <title>Dissociation and destruction of PAHs and PAH clusters induced by absorption of X-rays in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Only 8% of the protoplanetary discs orbiting a T Tauri star show emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). As PAHs are strong absorbers of UV radiation, they contribute to the heating of the discs photosphere, shielding of UV radiation that drives photo-chemistry in the disc, and their abundance is a key parameter to determine the strength of photo-evaporative disc winds. We want to understand the photochemical evolution of PAHs in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars and thus explain the absence of PAH features. We want to determine whether PAHs are destroyed because of the X-ray emission from their host stars or whether PAHs can withstand these conditions. We developed a model for the absorption of X-rays by PAHs. X-rays with more energy than the K edge of carbon will double ionise PAHs and will vibrationally excite them by ~ 15-35 eV. With a Monte Carlo model, we modelled the dissociation of H, H2, and C2H2 from PAH monomers. Furthermore, we modelled the dissociation of PAH clusters and the desorption of PAH clusters from dust grains caused by X-ray excitation. We find that small PAH clusters will quickly desorb and dissociate into individual molecules. PAH molecules experience rapid loss of H and acetylene C2H2 by the high excitation and will lose C2H2 on average after three X-ray excitations. However, large PAH clusters can stay intact and frozen out on dust grains. Based on our results, we expect a gas-phase PAH abundance that is lower than 0.01 times the ISM abundance and will rapidly decrease over time due to the dissociation of small clusters that are subsequently destroyed. To maintain a higher abundance, replenishment processes must exist such as vertical mixing. Large PAH clusters remain in the disc, frozen out on dust grains, but barely emit PAH features because of their strong thermal coupling to dust grains.</description>

      <title>Modelling magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M dwarfs Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti and GJ 1151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unambiguous detection of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) via radio observations would provide a novel method for detecting exoplanets and probing their magnetic fields. Although direct radio detection of sub-Jovian planets is hindered by the low frequencies involved, models of sub-Alfv\'enic SPI predict that Earth-like planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs may induce detectable emission. Here, we revisit the modelling of the expected radio emission from magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M-dwarf systems Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti, and GJ 1151, where claims of SPI-related radio detections have been made. For this, we use SIRIO (Star-planet Interaction and Radio Induced Observations), a public Python code that models radio emission from sub-Alfv\'enic SPI. We benchmark SIRIO results against those paradigmatic systems, whose SPI modeling has been previously discussed in the literature. Our results support previous findings that Proxima b, YZ Cet b, and the putative planet GJ 1151 b are most likely in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime (assuming a hybrid PFSS geometry), so SPI should be at work in all of them. We find that the Alfv\'en wing model generally predicts a very low level of radio emission, while if magnetic reconnection takes place, prospects for detection are significantly better. We also find that free-free absorption may play a relevant role, in particular in YZ Ceti. Our SIRIO code can also be used to evaluate the feasibility of radio proposals aimed at detecting SPI, and to constrain the stellar wind mass-loss rate or planetary magnetic field.</description>
