      <title>The Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation in Abraham's theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the threshold of the observed Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation is more accurately described by the new quantum theory, based on the theory of Abraham (1909), compared with the quantum theory of Ginzburg (1940), based on the theory of Minkowski (1908).</description>

      <title>Topological Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces topological regularization as a framework for handling ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theory, reinterpreting infinities as topological obstructions at spacetime boundaries. Through geometric compactification via stereographic projection, singularities are reframed as boundary artifacts. The framework employs causal embeddings and the causality group to preserve Lorentz invariance and unitarity, while homotopy-equivalent defect structures guarantee regularization independence via Stokes-Poincar\'e duality. The Physical Equivalence Theorem shows that homotopy-equivalent schemes yield identical renormalized observables. Renormalization group flows are governed by Euler characteristics, and anomalies are resolved through cobordism and Chern character integrals. This approach unifies UV/IR duality, anomaly cancellation, and Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction. Applications extend to AdS/CFT, PDEs, quantum simulators, and noncommutative geometry. Topological regularization replaces artificial cutoffs with intrinsic geometric mechanisms, positioning spacetime as a defect-entangled structure governed by topological invariants, with testable predictions in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>A conformal basis for cosmology with energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard FRW formalism, the scale factor is assumed to describe the expansion of the universe. However, by examining empty space with a positive cosmological constant (i.e., a de Sitter space), we find that this assumption is incorrect. When described in conformal time, the associated conformal metric exhibits a big bang singularity where the effective vacuum energy density diverges, dominating the early universe. The corresponding FRW scale factor decreases after the big bang, so that it does not describe the universe's expansion.
  Instead, the expansion is driven by global energy conservation: as the effective vacuum energy density decreases over time, space must expand to compensate. This leads to a linearly expanding universe, which agrees well with various cosmological observations - such as the red shifts of supernovae; the temperature dependence of the CMB radiation; and the near equality of the Hubble time and the age of the universe. Thus, the conformal vacuum metric can serve as a dominant background metric in cosmology, especially during the big bang era when it suggests new explanations for the creation of the initial energy and the first particles in the universe.
  Due to this dominance of vacuum energy, matter and radiation can be treated perturbatively. Even in their presence, the linear expansion remains the leading behavior, with the effective matter and radiation densities decreasing like $1/t^3$, just like the vacuum energy density. However, changes in their relative abundance can cause slight deviations from the linear expansion. Matter and radiation change the vacuum metric, thereby generating big secondary terms which could be responsible for the phenomenon of dark matter and for the acceleration of the expansion.</description>

      <title>A Model of Realistic Flavor Symmetry: Origin of Fermion Mass, Flavor Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I proposed a unified model of particle physic and cosmology in \cite {1}, which can simultaneously account for these phenomena of the inflation, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino mass and baryogenesis. I here focus on the fermion flavor issues in the model, which were not addressed previously. I introduce a realistic flavor symmetry to generate the fermion mass and mixing, from which the relationship between the quark mixing and the lepton mixing is derived, and the source of the difference between them is revealed. In particular, I derive a neutrino mass matrix which has a special structure form and contains five parameters, but its numerical solutions are precisely fitting to all the measured data of the neutrino mass spectrum, quark mixing and lepton mixing, and finely predict $m_{\nu_{2}}=0.01288$ eV. In addition, I discuss a new scenario of the leptogenesis in the model, which arises from two CP-asymmetric decays of a super-heavy neutral Dirac fermion, this scenario is closely related to the neutrino mass and mixing, so the baryon asymmetry is determined by the neutrino flavor parameters. Lastly, I suggest several approaches to test the model. In short, the model can simply and elegantly account for the fermion flavor issues and the baryon asymmetry, it has realistic and measurable significance, therefore we expect the ongoing and future experiments to test the model.</description>

      <title>Closed timelike curves in PT-symmetric wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a modified Einstein-Rosen wormhole model, made unidirectionally traversable through a bimetric geometry defined by two regular metrics, g(+) and g(-), and characterized by PT symmetry combining time reversal (t -&gt; -t) and spatial inversion (x -&gt; -x). In this framework, two distinct spacetime regions are identified at the wormhole throat (r = alpha) via PT symmetry, forming a single spacetime sheet. This model employs Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates to eliminate coordinate singularities at the throat, enabling traversability with a lightlike membrane of exotic matter at the junction to satisfy the Einstein field equations, similar to other traversable wormhole models. We extend this model by coupling two such wormholes to generate closed timelike curves (CTCs), made possible by the opposing causal orientations defined by the two metrics, while adhering to Novikov's self-consistency principle. An effective theory is developed for a scalar field crossing the wormhole, yielding PT-symmetric Klein-Gordon equations with a real energy spectrum ensured by pseudo-unitarity, consistent with quantum mechanical dynamics. These results open new avenues for exploring the effects of PT symmetry on causality and the quantization of scalar fields in traversable geometries.</description>
