      <title>A Clarifying Note on Long-Horizon Investment and Dollar-Cost Averaging: An Effective Investment Exposure Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely claimed in investment education and practice that extending the investment horizon reduces risk, and that diversifying investment timing, for example through dollar-cost averaging (DCA), further mitigates investment risk. Although such claims are intuitively appealing, they are often stated without precise definitions of risk or a clear separation between risk and uncertainty.
  This paper revisits these two beliefs within a unified probabilistic framework. We define risk at the expectation level as a property of the generating distribution of cumulative investment outcomes, and distinguish it from uncertainty, understood as the dispersion of realized outcomes across possible paths. To enable meaningful comparisons across horizons and investment schedules, we introduce the notion of effective investment exposure, defined as time-integrated invested capital.
  Under stationary return processes with finite variance, we show that extending the investment horizon does not alter expected risk, expected return, or the risk-return ratio on a per-unit-exposure basis. In contrast, different investment timing strategies can induce distinct exposure profiles over time. As a result, lump-sum investment and dollar-cost averaging may differ not only in uncertainty but also in expected risk when compared at equal return exposure, although the resulting risk differences are of constant order and do not grow with the investment horizon.
  These results clarify why common narratives surrounding long-horizon investment and dollar-cost averaging are conceptually misleading, while also explaining why adopting such strategies under budgetary or timing constraints need not be regarded as irrational.</description>

      <title>Correlation Structures and Regime Shifts in Nordic Stock Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are complex adaptive systems characterized by collective behavior and abrupt regime shifts, particularly during crises. This paper studies time-varying dependencies in Nordic equity markets and examines whether correlation-eigenstructure dynamics can be exploited for regime-aware portfolio construction. Using two decades of daily data for the OMXS30, OMXC20, and OMXH25 universes, pronounced regime dependence in rolling correlation matrices is documented: crisis episodes are characterized by sharp increases in the leading eigenvalue and counter-cyclical behavior in the second eigenvalue. Eigenportfolio regressions further support a market-factor interpretation of the dominant eigenmode. Building on these findings, an adaptive portfolio allocation framework is proposed, combining correlation-matrix cleaning, an eigenvalue-ratio crisis indicator and long-only minimum-variance optimization with constraints that bound exposures to dominant eigenmodes. Backtesting results indicate improved downside protection and risk-adjusted performance during stress regimes, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art benchmarks in tranquil periods.</description>

      <title>A Three--Dimensional Efficient Surface for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical mean-variance framework characterizes portfolio risk solely through return variance and the covariance matrix, implicitly assuming that all relevant sources of risk are captured by second moments. In modern financial markets, however, shocks often propagate through complex networks of interconnections, giving rise to systemic and spillover risks that variance alone does not reflect.
  This paper develops a unified portfolio optimization framework that incorporates connectedness risk alongside expected return and variance. Using a quadratic measure of network spillovers derived from a connectedness matrix, we formulate a three-objective optimization problem and characterize the resulting three-dimensional efficient surface. We establish existence, uniqueness, and continuity of optimal portfolios under mild regularity conditions and derive closed-form solutions when short-selling is allowed. The trade-off between variance and connectedness is shown to be strictly monotone except in degenerate cases, yielding a well-defined risk-risk frontier.
  Under simultaneous diagonalizability of the covariance and connectedness matrices, we prove a three-fund separation theorem: all efficient portfolios can be expressed as affine combinations of a minimum-variance portfolio, a minimum-connectedness portfolio, and the tangency portfolio. The framework clarifies how network-based risk alters classical diversification results and provides a transparent theoretical foundation for incorporating systemic connectedness into portfolio choice.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Portfolio Optimization via Energy-Based Models: A Comparative Analysis Using the Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library (THRML) for Index Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization under cardinality constraints transforms the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem from a convex quadratic problem into an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting.
  We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Smart Predict--then--Optimize Paradigm for Portfolio Optimization in Real Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improvements in return forecast accuracy do not always lead to proportional improvements in portfolio decision quality, especially under realistic trading frictions and constraints. This paper adopts the Smart Predict--then--Optimize (SPO) paradigm for portfolio optimization in real markets, which explicitly aligns the learning objective with downstream portfolio decision quality rather than pointwise prediction accuracy. Within this paradigm, predictive models are trained using an SPO-based surrogate loss that directly reflects the performance of the resulting investment decisions. To preserve interpretability and robustness, we employ linear predictors built on return-based and technical-indicator features and integrate them with portfolio optimization models that incorporate transaction costs, turnover control, and regularization. We evaluate the proposed approach on U.S. ETF data (2015--2025) using a rolling-window backtest with monthly rebalancing. Empirical results show that decision-focused training consistently improves risk-adjusted performance over predict--then--optimize baselines and classical optimization benchmarks, and yields strong robustness during adverse market regimes (e.g., the 2020 COVID-19). These findings highlight the practical value of the Smart Predict--then--Optimize paradigm for portfolio optimization in realistic and non-stationary financial environments.</description>
