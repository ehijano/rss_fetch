      <title>Fusion Intelligence: Confluence of Natural and Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Problem-Solving Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fusion Intelligence (FI), a bio-inspired intelligent system, where the innate sensing, intelligence and unique actuation abilities of biological organisms such as bees and ants are integrated with the computational power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This interdisciplinary field seeks to create systems that are not only smart but also adaptive and responsive in ways that mimic the nature. As FI evolves, it holds the promise of revolutionizing the way we approach complex problems, leveraging the best of both biological and digital worlds to create solutions that are more effective, sustainable, and harmonious with the environment. We demonstrate FI's potential to enhance agricultural IoT system performance through a simulated case study on improving insect pollination efficacy (entomophily).</description>

      <title>Swarm Synergy: A Silent and Anonymous Way of Forming Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel swarm algorithm, swarm synergy, designed for robots to form communities within a swarm autonomously and anonymously. These communities, characterized as clusters of robots, emerge without any (pre-defined or communicated) specific locations. Each robot operates as a silent agent, having no communication capability, making independent decisions based on local parameters. The proposed algorithm allows silent robots to achieve this self-organized swarm behavior using only sensory inputs from the environment. The robots intend to form a community by sensing the neighbors, creating synergy in a bounded environment. We further infer the behavior of swarm synergy to ensure the anonymity/untraceability of both robots and communities and show the results on dynamicity of various parameters relevant to swarm communities such as community size, community location, number of community, no specific agent structure in the community, etc. The results are further analysed to observe the effect of sensing limitations posed by the onboard sensor's field of view. Simulations and experiments are performed to showcase the algorithm's scalability, robustness, and fast convergence. Compared to the state-of-art with similar objectives, the proposed communication-free swarm synergy shows comparative time to synergize or form communities. The proposed algorithm finds applications in studying crowd dynamics under high-stress scenarios such as fire, attacks, or disasters.</description>
