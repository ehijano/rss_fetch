      <title>Entropic transfer operators for stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can be analyzed via their Frobenius-Perron transfer operator and its estimation from data is an active field of research. Recently entropic transfer operators have been introduced to estimate the operator of deterministic systems. The approach is based on the regularizing properties of entropic optimal transport plans. In this article we generalize the method to stochastic and non-stationary systems and give a quantitative convergence analysis of the empirical operator as the available samples increase. We introduce a way to extend the operator's eigenfunctions to previously unseen samples, such that they can be efficiently included into a spectral embedding. The practicality and numerical scalability of the method are demonstrated on a real-world fluid dynamics experiment.</description>

      <title>An Approximate-Master-Equation Formulation of the Watts Threshold Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks, researchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals. However, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more individuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study dynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur between any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model (WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very recently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to polyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their discrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations (AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy. We then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled differential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much lower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically and is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and calculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large spreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of a French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships. We find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these empirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates structural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the dynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Design of a low-thrust gravity-assisted rendezvous trajectory to Halley's comet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comets are the most pristine planetesimals left from the formation of the Solar System. They carry unique information on the materials and the physical processes which led to the presence of planets and moons. Many important questions about cometary physics, such as origin, constituents and mechanism of cometary activity, remain unanswered. The next perihelion of comet 1P/Halley, in 2061, is an excellent opportunity to revisit this object of outstanding scientific and cultural relevance. In 1986, during its latest approach to the Sun, several flyby targeted Halley's comet to observe its nucleus and shed light on its properties, origin, and evolution. However, due to its retrograde orbit and high ecliptic inclination, the quality of data was limited by the large relative velocity and short time spent by the spacecraft inside the coma of the comet. A rendezvous mission like ESA/Rosetta would overcome such limitations, but the trajectory design is extremely challenging due to the shortcomings of current propulsion technology. Given the considerable lead times of spacecraft development and the long duration of the interplanetary transfer required to reach the comet, it is imperative to start mission planning several decades in advance. This study presents a low-thrust rendezvous strategy to reach the comet before the phase of intense activity during the close approach to the Sun. The trajectory design combines a gravity-assist maneuver with electric propulsion arcs to maximize scientific payload mass while constraining transfer duration. A propulsive plane change maneuver would be prohibitive. To keep the propellant budget within reasonable limits, most of the plane change maneuver is achieved via either a Jupiter or a Saturn flyby. The interplanetary low-thrust gravity-assisted trajectory design strategy is described, followed by the presentation of multiple proof-of-concept solutions.</description>

      <title>Word problems and embedding-obstructions in cellular automata groups on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study groups of reversible cellular automata, or CA groups, on groups. More generally, we consider automorphism groups of subshifts of finite type on groups. It is known that word problems of CA groups on virtually nilpotent groups are in co-NP, and can be co-NP-hard. We show that under the Gap Conjecture of Grigorchuk, their word problems are PSPACE-hard on all other groups. On free and surface groups, we show that they are indeed always in PSPACE. On a group with co-NEXPTIME word problem, CA groups themselves have co-NEXPTIME word problem, and on the lamplighter group (which itself has polynomial-time word problem) we show they can be co-NEXPTIME-hard. We show also two nonembeddability results: the group of cellular automata on a non-cyclic free group does not embed in the group of cellular automata on the integers (this solves a question of Barbieri, Carrasco-Vargas and Rivera-Burgos); and the group of cellular automata in dimension $D$ does not embed in a group of cellular automata in dimension $d$ if $D \geq 3d+2$ (this solves a question of Hochman).</description>

      <title>Control analysis and synthesis for general control-affine systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides controllability analysis and control synthesis for general control-affine systems, potentially subject to a bounded perturbation. We establish sufficient controllability conditions based on a proper generalization of the controllability Gramian for linear systems. Under these sufficient conditions, control syntheses are developed. We provide two control input constructions for a given system, either of which can steer the system from a given initial state to any desired target state within a finite time horizon. As in our analysis, in the case of linearity, these syntheses are reduced to common control inputs based on the controllability of Gramian. Additionally, we derive a sharp upper bound on the $L^2$-norm of these control functions, allowing us to derive insights into the energy required to enact control. The work advances the theory of nonlinear controllability and provides an analytical framework that facilitates numerical verification and practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Boundary stratifications of Hurwitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hurwitz space that parametrises holomorphic maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$. Abramovich, Corti and Vistoli, building on work of Harris and Mumford, describe a compactification $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$ with a natural boundary stratification. We show that the irreducible strata of $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$ are in bijection with combinatorial objects called decorated trees (up to a suitable equivalence), and that containment of irreducible strata is given by edge contraction of decorated trees. This combinatorial description allows us to define a tropical Hurwitz space, refining a definition given by Cavalieri, Markwig and Ranganathan. We also discuss applications to complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Linear dynamical systems with continuous weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In discrete-time linear dynamical systems (LDSs), a linear map is repeatedly applied to an initial vector yielding a sequence of vectors called the orbit of the system. A weight function assigning weights to the points in the orbit can be used to model quantitative aspects, such as resource consumption, of a system modelled by an LDS. This paper addresses the problems of how to compute the mean payoff, the total accumulated weight, and the discounted accumulated weight of the orbit under continuous weight functions as well as polynomial weight functions as a special case. Additionally, weight functions that are definable in an o-minimal extension of the theory of the reals with exponentiation, which can be shown to be piecewise continuous, are considered. In particular, good ergodic properties of o-minimal weight functions, instrumental to the computation of the mean payoff, are established. Besides general LDSs, the special cases of stochastic LDSs and LDSs with bounded orbits are addressed. Finally, the problem of deciding whether an energy constraint is satisfied by the weighted orbit, i.e., whether the accumulated weight never drops below a given bound, is analysed.</description>

      <title>Invariant distributions of partially hyperbolic systems: fractal graphs, excessive regularity, and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach linking fractal geometry to partially hyperbolic dynamics, revealing several new phenomena related to regularity jumps and rigidity. One key result demonstrates a sharp phase transition for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms $f \in \mathrm{Diff}^\infty_{\mathrm{vol}}(\mathbb{T}^3)$ with a contracting center direction: $f$ is $C^\infty$-rigid if and only if both $E^s$ and $E^c$ exhibit H\"older exponents exceeding the expected threshold. Specifically, we prove:
  If the H\"older exponent of $E^s$ exceeds the expected value, then $E^s$ is $C^{1+}$ and $E^u \oplus E^s$ is jointly integrable.
  If the H\"older exponent of $E^c$ exceeds the expected value, then $W^c$ forms a $C^{1+}$ foliation.
  If $E^s$ (or $E^c$) does not exhibit excessive H\"older regularity, it must have a fractal graph.
  These and related results originate from a general non-fractal invariance principle: for a skew product $F$ over a partially hyperbolic system $f$, if $F$ expands fibers more weakly than $f$ along $W^u_f$ in the base, then for any $F$-invariant section, if $\Phi$ has no a fractal graph, then it is smooth along $W^u_f$ and holonomy-invariant.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new conjecture on the stable fractal or stable smooth behavior of invariant distributions in typical partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>The automorphism group of a strongly irreducible subshift on a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ of a non-trivial strongly irreducible subshift $X$ on an arbitrary infinite group $G$ and generalize classical results of Ryan, Kim and Roush.
  We generalize Ryan's theorem by showing that the center of $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ is generated by shifts by elements of the center of $G$ modded out by the kernel of the shift action.
  We generalize Kim and Roush's theorem by showing that if the free group $F_k$ of rank $k\geq 1$ embeds into $G$, then the automorphism group of any full $F_k$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$. If $X$ is an SFT, or more generally, if $X$ satisfies the strong topological Markov property, then we can weaken the conditions on $G$. In this case we show that the automorphism group of any full $\mathbb{Z}$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ provided $G$ is not locally finite, and that the automorphism group of any full $F_k$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ whenever $G$ is nonamenable. Our results rely on a new marker lemma which is valid for any nonempty strongly irreducible subshift on an infinite group.
  We remark that our results are new even for $G=\mathbb{Z}$ as they do not require the subshift to be an SFT.</description>

      <title>Biomass transfer on autocatalytic reaction network: a delay differential equation formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a biological system to grow and expand, mass must be transferred from the environment to the system and be assimilated into its reaction network. Here, I characterize the biomass transfer process for growing autocatalytic systems. By track biomass along reaction pathways, an n-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the reaction network can be reformulated into a one-dimensional delay differential equation (DDE) for its long-term dynamics. The kernel function of the DDE summarizes the overall amplification and transfer delay of the system and serves as a signature for autocatalysis dynamics. The DDE formulation allows reaction networks of various topologies and complexities to be compared and provides rigorous estimation scheme for growth rate upon dimensional reduction of reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Nonlinear Guidance Strategies for Guaranteed Pursuit-Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents -- a purser, an evader, and a defender. We develop cooperative guidance laws for the evader-defender team that guarantee that the defender intercepts the pursuer before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, we propose a geometric solution to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another alluring feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require the knowledge of the pursuer's strategy and that the pursuer's interception is guaranteed from arbitrary initial engagement geometries. We further show that the necessary error variables for the evader-defender team vanish within a time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cooperative defense strategy via simulation in diverse engagement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven Synchronization of Vicsek Model in Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek model has long stood as a pivotal framework in exploring collective behavior and self-organization, captivating the scientific community with its compelling dynamics. However, understanding how noise influences synchronization within this model and its associated phase transition characteristics has presented significant challenges. While numerous studies have focused on simulations due to the model's mathematical complexity, comprehensive theoretical analyses remain sparse. In this paper, we deliver a rigorous mathematical proof demonstrating that for any initial configuration of the Vicsek model, there exists a bound on noise amplitude such that if the noise amplitude is maintained within this bound, the system will achieve synchronization in mean. This finding not only lays a solid mathematical groundwork for the Vicsek model's phase transition theory but also underscores the critical role of noise in collective dynamics, enhancing our understanding of self-organizing systems in stochastic environments.</description>
