      <title>Self-embeddings of homogeneous self-similar sets generated by three maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0&lt; \rho &lt; 1/3$ and $\rho \le \lambda \le 1-2\rho$, let $E$ be the self-similar set generated by the iterated function system $$\Phi = \big\{ \varphi_1(x) = \rho x ,\; \varphi_2(x) = \rho x + \lambda, \; \varphi_3(x) = \rho x + 1- \rho \big\}.$$ All contractive similitudes $f$ with $f(E) \subset E$ are characterized: one can find $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n \in \{1,2,3\}$ such that \[ f(E)=\varphi_{i_1} \circ \varphi_{i_2} \circ \cdots \circ \varphi_{i_n} (E). \]</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Continuity and Formulas of the Gradient Vector of the SRB Entropy Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sobolev embedding theorem implies that the SRB entropy functional is also differentiable in the family of Anosov diffeomorphisms equipped with a suitable Hilbert manifold structure. The same holds true for the SRB entropy functional over the family of smooth expanding maps on a closed Riemannian manifold. This implication leads to the local existence of the gradient flow of the SRB entropy and an explicit formula for the gradient vector of the entropy functional via the linear response of the SRB measure.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Fractal Histopolation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method for constructing a nonlinear fractal histopolation function associated with a given histogram is introduced in this paper. In contrast to classical fractal interpolation methods, which produce continuous and interpolatory functions, the proposed approach constructs a bounded, Riemann integrable function that is not necessarily continuous but preserves the area of a given histogram. An iterated function system based on Rakotch contractions- a generalisation of Banach contractions- is utilised, thereby extending the theoretical framework for fractal histopolation. Unlike previous formulations, the proposed construction of nonlinear fractal functions allows vertical scaling factors greater than one. The conditions for the nonlinear fractal function to be a solution for the histopolation problem are derived.</description>

      <title>Stability and Bifurcation Analysis of Two-term Fractional Difference Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the linear equation including two fractional order difference operators, viz. $\Delta^{\alpha}$ and $\Delta^{\beta}$, $0&lt;\beta&lt;\alpha \leq 1$. The sequence representation will be provided to find the solution in an easier way. The Z-transform will be used to find the boundary of the stable region in the complex plane. If the coefficient of the operator $\Delta^{\beta}$ is negative (near 0), then we observe that the boundary curve has multiple points generating multiple stability regions. We provide all possible bifurcations in terms of parameters. An ample number of examples will be provided to support the results.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcations and Pattern Formation in Target-Offender-Guardian Crime Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a reaction-advection-diffusion model of a target-offender-guardian system designed to capture interactions between urban crime and policing. Using Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theory and spectral analysis, we establish rigorous conditions for both steady-state and Hopf bifurcations. These results identify critical thresholds of policing intensity at which spatially uniform equilibria lose stability, leading either to persistent heterogeneous hotspots or oscillatory crime-policing cycles. From a criminological perspective, such thresholds represent tipping points in guardian mobility: once crossed, they can lock neighborhoods into stable clusters of criminal activity or trigger recurrent waves of hotspot formation. Numerical simulations complement the theory, exhibiting stationary patterns, periodic oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. By explicitly incorporating law enforcement as a third interacting component, our framework extends classical two-equation models. It offers new tools for analyzing nonlinear interactions, bifurcations, and pattern formation in multi-agent social systems.</description>

      <title>Predator-prey models with memory and kicks: Exact solution and discrete maps with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed new predator-prey models that take into account memory and kicks. Memory is understood as the dependence of current behavior on the history of past behavior. The equations of these proposed models are generalizations of the Lotka-Volterra and Kolmogorov equations by using the Caputo fractional derivative of non-integer order and periodic kicks. This fractional derivative allows us to take into account memory with power-law fading. The periodic kicks, which are described by Dirac delta-functions, take into account short duration of interaction between predators and prey. For the proposed equations, which are fractional differential equations with kicks, we obtain exact solutions that describe behaviors of predator and prey with power-law fading memory. Using these exact solutions, we derive, without using any approximations, new discrete maps with memory that represent the proposed predator-prey models with memory.</description>

      <title>Compositional System Dynamics: The Higher Mathematics Underlying System Dynamics Diagrams &amp; Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a robust mathematical foundation for compositional System Dynamics modeling, leveraging category theory to formalize and enhance the representation, analysis, and composition of system models. Here, System Dynamics diagrams, such as stock &amp; flow diagrams, system structure diagrams, and causal loop diagrams, are formulated as categorical constructs, enabling scalable, transparent, and systematic reasoning. By encoding these diagrams as data using attributed C-sets and utilizing advanced categorical tools like structured cospans, pushouts, pullbacks, and functor mappings, the framework supports modular composition, stratification, and seamless mapping between syntax and semantics.
  The approach underwrites traditional practice with firm mathematical structure, facilitates the identification of certain forms of pathways and feedback loops, the detection of simple patterns within complex diagrams, common structure between diagrams, and structure-preserving mappings between diverse diagram types. Additionally, this framework supports alternative semantics, such as stochastic transition dynamics, extending beyond traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) representations. Applications in compositional modeling, modularity, and team-based collaboration demonstrate the practical advantages of this advanced framework.
  Future directions include integrating dimensional annotations, supporting hybrid and agent-based modeling paradigms, and expanding the framework's applicability to global and local temporal reasoning through temporal sheaves. By revealing and formalizing the hidden mathematical structure of System Dynamics diagrams, this work empowers practitioners to tackle complex systems with clarity, scalability, and rigor.</description>

      <title>Easy estimates of Lyapunov exponents for random products of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ be square matrices (over reals). Let $W=w(A_1, \ldots, A_k)$ be a random product of $n$ matrices. What is the expected absolute value of the largest (in the absolute value) entry in such a random product? What is the (maximal) Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give a complete answer to the first question. For the second question, we offer a very simple and efficient method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Learning From Simulators: A Theory of Simulation-Grounded Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions. SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited regimes.</description>

      <title>On the failure of weak convergence for Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\cP$ be the set of prime numbers, and $X_p,\, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables such that $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $(\te_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ the corresponding random multiplicative functions of Radamacher type, namely, $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. The motivation behind considering these variables comes from the Riemann Hypothesis since $(\te_\ell)$ can be viewed as the random counterpart of the M\"obius function $\mu(\ell)$ and the RH is equivalent to $\sum_{\ell\leq n}\mu(\ell)=o(n^{1/2+\varepsilon}), \forall \varepsilon&gt;0$. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However,
  S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{\sqrt n}\to 0$ in distribution. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(\sqrt n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. In this paper we, in particular, show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on trigonometric identities, Levi's continuity theorem, the prime numbers theorem and the growth rates of the prime omega function $\om(n)$. Combining these tools we show that if a weak limit exists then the characteristic function of $S_n/a_n$ must converge to $0$ at any nonzero point. As a byproduct of our method we are also able to provide essentially optimal upper bounds on high order moments similar to \cite{Har19}, using different methods and for more general $X_p$'s.</description>

Abstract: We prove a dichotomy of almost periodicity for reflectionless one-dimensional Dirac operators whose spectra satisfy certain geometric conditions, extending work of Volberg--Yuditskii. We also construct a weakly mixing Dirac operator with a non-constant continuous potential whose spectrum is purely absolutely continuous, adapting Avila's argument for continuous Schr\"odinger operators. In particular, we disprove the Kotani--Last conjecture in the setting of one-dimensional Dirac operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the complexity functions of subshifts up to asymptotic equivalence. The complexity function of every aperiodic function is non-decreasing, submultiplicative and grows at least linearly. We prove that conversely, every function satisfying these conditions is asymptotically equivalent to the complexity function of a recurrent subshift, equivalently, a recurrent infinite word. Our construction is explicit, algorithmic in nature and is philosophically based on constructing certain 'Cantor sets of integers', whose 'gaps' correspond to blocks of zeros. We also prove that every non-decreasing submultiplicative function is asymptotically equivalent, up a linear error term, to the complexity function of a minimal subshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantitative direct method to prove the local stability of a stationary solution for a rough differential equation and its regular discretization scheme. Using Doss-Sussmann technique and stopping time analysis, we provide stability criteria for a stationary solution of the continuous system to be exponentially stable, provided the diffusion term is bounded and its derivatives exhibit small growth. The same conclusions hold for the regular discretization scheme with a sufficiently small step size, but one needs to apply the sewing lemma and stopping times for the discrete time set. Our stability criteria are based on the linearization of the drift and require only information about the bound and growth rates of the diffusion, making them data-driven criteria.</description>

      <title>Universal projection theorems with applications to multifractal analysis and the dimension of every ergodic measure on self-conformal sets simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrized family of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection M of measures on X under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\dim_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \dim_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of $\mu$). We require family $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and collection M to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. Under the same assumptions, we also prove that if the Assouad dimension of X is smaller than d, then for almost every $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz (i.e. with pointwise $\alpha$-H\"older inverse for every $\alpha \in (0,1)$) at $\mu$-a.e. x, for all $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting encompasses families of orthogonal projections, natural projections corresponding to conformal iterated function systems, and non-autonomous or random IFS.
  As applications, we provide novel results on the multifractal analysis, giving formula for the Hausdorff dimension of a level set of the local dimension for a typical (w.r.t the translation parameter) self-similar measure on the line, valid for the full range spectrum (including the decreasing part of the spectrum; previous results were covering only the increasing part).
  Among another applications, we prove that given a parametrized contracting conformal IFS satisfying the transversality condition, for almost every parameter the dimension formula holds for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously. We also prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand's projection theorem holds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on a strongly separated self-conformal set and for the collection of all Gibbs measures on a self-conformal set (without any separation).</description>

We prove a fixed point result for such mappings and show that our results are more general then the existing ones.

Abstract: Recently, Kvalheim and Sontag provided a generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for equilibria under asymptotically stable continuous vector fields. By leveraging topological properties of Lyapunov functions, their theorem works without assuming hyperbolicity. We extend their theorem to a class of possibly discontinuous vector fields, in particular, to vector fields generating asymptotically stable semiflows.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution for some one parameter unipotent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove effective equidistribution theorems, with polynomial error rate, for orbits of the unipotent subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ in arithmetic quotients of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ and $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)\times\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$.
  The proof is based on the use of a Margulis function, tools from incidence geometry, and the spectral gap of the ambient space.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic behaviour in one- and two-dimensional interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a class of examples of interacting particle systems on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d\in\{1,2\}$, that admit a unique translation-invariant stationary measure, which is not the long-time limit of all translation-invariant starting measures, due to the existence of time-periodic orbits in the associated measure-valued dynamics. This is the first such example and shows that even in low dimensions, not every limit point of the measure-valued dynamics needs to be a time-stationary measure.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in the density of states of a chaotic dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the statistics of a chaotic system can be predicted by constructing an associated sequence of periodic differential operators and computing their densities of states. For such operators, the density of states is well understood and can be computed straightforwardly, often yielding explicit formulas. As a case study, we investigate a nonlinear recursion relation that maps naturally onto a family of periodic operators generated by a Fibonacci tiling rule. This correspondence enables us to derive an explicit formula for the limiting statistics of the chaotic system and to demonstrate that the clustering near to critical values is equivalent to the van Hove singularities in the operators' densities of states.</description>

      <title>Multi-set spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the supra-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for learning communities in time-evolving networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We consider the supra-Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the supra-Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <title>Existence proofs of traveling wave solutions on an infinite strip for the suspension bridge equation and proof of orbital stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computer-assisted approach for constructively proving the existence of traveling wave solutions of the suspension bridge equation on the infinite strip $\Omega = \mathbb{R} \times (-d_2,d_2)$. Using a meticulous Fourier analysis, we derive a quantifiable approximate inverse $\mathbb{A}$ for the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\bar{u})$ of the PDE at an approximate traveling wave solution $\bar{u}$. Such approximate objects are obtained thanks to Fourier coefficients sequences and operators, arising from Fourier series expansions on a rectangle $\Omega_0 = (-d_1,d_1) \times (-d_2,d_2)$. In particular, the challenging exponential nonlinearity of the equation is tackled using a rigorous control of the aliasing error when computing related Fourier coefficients. This allows to establish a Newton-Kantorovich approach, from which the existence of a true traveling wave solution of the PDE can be proven in a vicinity of $\bar{u}$. We successfully apply such a methodology in the case of the suspension bridge equation and prove the existence of multiple traveling wave solutions on $\Omega$. Finally, given a proven solution $\tilde{u}$, a Fourier series approximation on $\Omega_0$ allows us to accurately enclose the spectrum of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Such a tight control provides the number of negative eigenvalues, which in turns, allows to conclude about the orbital (in)stability of $\tilde{u}$.</description>
