      <title>Connected correlations in cold atom experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of single-atom-resolved probes has made full counting statistics measurements accessible in quantum gas experiments. This capability provides access to high-order moments of physical observables, from which cumulants, or equivalently connected correlations, can be precisely determined. Through a selection of recent cold atom experiments, this article illustrates the significance of connected correlations in characterizing ensembles of interacting quantum particles. First, non-zero connected correlations of order n &gt; 2 unambiguously identify non-Gaussian quantum states. Second, connected correlations of order n identify clusters made of n elements whose statistical properties are irreducible to combinations of smaller clusters. The ability to identify such multi-particle clusters offers a an interesting perspective on strongly correlated quantum states of matter at the microscopic scale.</description>

      <title>A nonequilibrium quantum Otto engine enhanced via multi-parameter control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in experimental control of interacting quantum many-body systems with multiple tunable parameters--such as ultracold atomic gases and trapped ions--are driving rapid progress in quantum thermodynamics and enabling the design of quantum thermal machines. In this work, we utilize a sudden quench approximation as a means to investigate the operation of a quantum thermodynamic Otto cycle in which multiple parameters are simultaneously controllable. The method applies universally to many-body systems where such control is available, and therefore provides general principles for investigating their operation as a working medium in quantum thermal machines. We investigate application of this multi-parameter quench protocol in an experimentally realistic one-dimensional Bose gas as the working fluid, with control over both the frequency of an external harmonic trap and the interparticle interaction strength. We derive a general inequality for the net work of this two-parameter Otto cycle, demonstrating that this protocol out-performs its constituent single-parameter Otto cycles when operating as an engine, and additionally implying an enhancement to the coefficient of performance when operating as a refrigerator. Further, we demonstrate that multi-parameter control can exhibit dramatically improved performance of the Otto engine when compared not only to single-parameter constituent quenches but also to the combined effect of its constituent engine cycles.</description>

      <title>Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the recombination rates into quantum bound channels across a series of ion-atom scattering lengths. Our results confirms the breakdown of the theory of 'van-der-Waals universality' and the effective range theory, both of which fail to describe the recombination rates in ion-atom systems for large scattering lengths. We investigate this phenomenon further -- through calculations we observe the appearance of weakly bound ionic triatomic molecules. We compare the spectrum and lifetimes of these trimers to neutral system and present results indicating that such trimers could be stable with respect to modern experiments.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Soliton Systems: an Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A briefly formulated update of the recently published review [1] on the topic of multidimensional solitons (chiefly, in nonlinear optics and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)) is presented. The update briefly summarizes some notable results on this topic that have been reported very recently, and offers a compact outline of the directions of the current experiment and theoretical work in this and related fields. In particular, as concerns newest experimental findings, included are the creation of multiple quantum droplets in prolate BEC, and the observation of expanding toroidal light structures in linear optics. The update of theoretical results includes the analysis of 2D solitons in the optical system with the quadratic nonlinearity and fractional diffraction, and the prediction of stable 3D vortex solitons in various BEC schemes with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in ultracold atomic gas experiments, we investigate a two-terminal mesoscopic system in which two-body loss occurs locally at the center of a one-dimensional chain. By means of the self-consistent Born approximation in the Keldysh formalism, we uncover mesoscopic current formulas that are experimentally relevant and applicable to the weak dissipation regime. Although these formulas are analogous to those for systems with one-body loss, it turns out that the channel transmittance and loss probability depend on the nonequilibrium occupation at the lossy site. We demonstrate that this occupation dependence leads to a weaker suppression of currents in the presence of two-body loss compared to one-body loss.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of a mobile impurity injected into a one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of an impurity immersed with a finite velocity into a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied within the framework of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches. We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of motion with respect to the initial one.</description>

      <title>Beyond mean-field effects in Josephson oscillations and self-trapping of Bose-Einstein condensates in two-dimensional dual-core traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a binary Bose gas in a symmetric dual-core, pancake-shaped trap, modelled by two linearly coupled two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. Two different cases are considered. First, we consider a spatially uniform condensate, where we identify the domains of parameters for macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping and localisation revivals. The analytical formulas for the Josephson frequencies in the zero- and $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the system displays a rich bifurcation structure. In the zero-phase, two successive pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase exhibits a single pitchfork bifurcation.
  The second case is when the quantum droplets are in a dual-core trap. Analytical predictions for the oscillation frequencies are derived via a variational approach for the coupled dynamics of quantum droplets, and direct numerical simulations validate the results. We identify critical values of the linear coupling that separate Josephson and self-trapped regimes as the particle number changes. We also found the Andreev-Bashkin superfluid drag effect in numerical simulations of the droplet-droplet interactions in the two-core geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol for the realization of a fast and high-fidelity controlled-phase gate in Rydberg atoms is developed. The adiabatic state transfer, driven in the high-blockade limit, is sped up by compensating nonadiabatic transitions via oscillating fields that mimic a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. High fidelities are obtained in wide parameter regions. The implementation of the bare effective counterdiabatic field, without original adiabatic pulses, enables to bypass gate errors produced by the accumulation of blockade-dependent dynamical phases, making the protocol efficient also at low blockade values. As an application toward quantum algorithms, how the fidelity of the gate impacts the efficiency of a minimal quantum-error correction circuit is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Geometric Frustration Assisted Kinetic Ferromagnetism in Doped Mott Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding ferromagnetism mechanism in doped Mott insulators on frustrated lattices remains challenging at intermediate coupling and finite doping. Here, we study the itinerant ferromagnetism and propose its mechanism in doped Mott insulators on a geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field methods, we reveal that itinerant ferromagnetism appears at intermediate coupling ($10\lesssim U\ll\infty$) near 50% electron doping in the triangular-lattice Hubbard model. By analyzing all microscopic hopping processes, we find that doublon-singlon exchange alone drives the fully polarized ferromagnetism and uncovers the particle-hole asymmetry. We also establish the magnetic phase diagram and compare local spin correlations with recent experiments. Random phase approximation and DMRG calculations consistently confirm that the ferromagnetism persists when $SU(2)$ symmetry is explicitly broken by magnetic anisotropy. These results clarify a microscopic route to itinerant ferromagnetism at intermediate coupling and finite doping in doped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show numerically that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the Universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.</description>

Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -&gt; $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -&gt; $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\mu$K and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.</description>
