      <title>Pixelated Bayer Spectral Router Based on Sparse Meta-atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been a challenging task to improve the light collection efficiency of conventional image sensors built with color filters that inevitably cause the energy loss of out-of-band photons. Although various schemes have been proposed to address the issue, it is still very hard to make a reasonable tradeoff between device performance and practicability. In this work, we demonstrate a pixelated spectral router based on sparse meta-atom array, which can efficiently separate the incident R (600-700 nm), G (500-600 nm), and B (400-500 nm) band light to the corresponding pixels of a Bayer image sensor, providing over 56% signal enhancement above the traditional color filter scheme. The CMOS-compatible spectral router has superior characteristics of polarization insensitivity and high incident angle tolerance (over 30{\deg}), enabled by simple compound Si3N4 nanostructures which are very suitable for massive production. Imaging experiments are conducted to verify its potential for real applications. Our pixelated spectral router scheme is also found to be robust and could be freely adapted to image sensors of various pixel sizes, having great potential in building the new generation of high-performance image sensing components.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric compressed sensing with hollow, self-assembled diffractive films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing light's polarization and wavefront direction enables surface curvature assessment, material identification, shadow differentiation, and improved image quality in turbid environments. Traditional methods utilize multiple sensors and polarization-filtering optics, resulting in reduced image resolution due to the loss of signal information at each photodetector. We propose a compressive sensing technique that mitigates information loss by using a low-refractive-index, self-assembled optical encoders. These optical nanostructures scatter light into polarization-dependent lattice modes and respond to input polarization ellipticity. Our study reveals that the wavefront direction and the polarization are encoded in the interference patterns and the linear component of the diffraction. Combining optical encoders with a shallow neural network, the system predicts pointing and polarization when equally spaced sensors are separated by less than 20{\deg}. Comparison of polycrystalline and short-range ordered optical encoders shows that the latter has a higher compression ratio. Our work centers on the unexpected modulation and spatial multiplexing of incident light polarization by self-assembled hollow nanocavity arrays as a new class of materials for optical computing, compressed sensing and imaging.</description>

      <title>3D-printed axicon enables extended depth-of-focus intravascular optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in endoscopy is how to fabricate a small fiber-optic probe that can achieve comparable function to probes with large, complicated optics (e.g., high resolution and extended depth of focus). To achieve high resolution over an extended depth of focus (DOF), the application of needle-like beams has been proposed. However, existing methods using miniaturized needle beam designs fail to adequately correct astigmatism and other monochromatic aberrations, limiting the resolution of at least one axis. Here, we describe a novel approach to realize freeform beam-shaping endoscopic probes via two-photon direct laser writing, also known as micro 3D-printing. We present a design achieving approximately 8-micron resolution with a DOF of &gt;0.8 mm at a central wavelength of 1310 nm. The probe has a diameter of 0.25 mm (without the catheter sheaths) and is fabricated using a single printing step directly on the optical fiber. We demonstrate our device in intravascular imaging of living atherosclerotic pigs at multiple time points, as well as human arteries with plaques ex vivo. This is the first step to enable beam-tailoring endoscopic probes which achieve diffraction-limited resolution over a large DOF.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit-Locking Chiral Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs), which are confined optical modes exhibiting infinite quality factors and carrying topological polarization configurations in momentum space, have recently sparked significant interest across both fundamental and applied physics.} Here we show that breaking time-reversal symmetry by external magnetic field enables a new form of chiral BICs with spin-orbit locking. Applying a magnetic field to a magneto-optical photonic crystal slab lifts doubly degenerate BICs into a pair of chiral BICs carrying opposite pseudo-spins and orbital angular momenta. Multipole analysis verifies the non-zero angular momenta and reveals the spin-orbital-locking behaviors. In momentum space, we observe ultrahigh quality factors and near-circular polarization surrounding chiral BICs, enabling potential applications in spin-selective nanophotonics. Compared to conventional BICs, the magnetically-induced chiral BICs revealed here exhibit distinct properties and origins, significantly advancing the topological photonics of BICs by incorporating broken time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Double helical plasmonic antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic double helical antennas are a means to funnel circularly polarized states of light down to the nanoscale. Here, an existing design tool for single helices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas that combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional light emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides additional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The experimentally realized double helical antennas were studied regarding their polarization-dependent transmission behavior resulting in a large and broadband dissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an important tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum photonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future nanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Picophotonics of Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonics, which deals with the study of light-matter interaction at scales smaller than the wavelength of radiation, has widespread applications from plasmonic waveguiding, topological photonic crystals, super-lensing, solar absorbers, and infrared imaging. The physical phenomena governing these effects can be captured by using a macroscopic homogenized quantity called the refractive index. However, the lattice-level description of optical waves in a crystalline material using a quantum theory has long been unresolved. Inspired by the dynamics of electron waves and their corresponding band structure, here, we put forth a pico-optical band theory of solids which reveals waves hidden deep within a crystal lattice. We show that these hidden waves arise from optical pico-indices, a family of quantum functions obeying crystal symmetries, and cannot be described by the conventional concept of refractive index. We present for the first time - the hidden waves and pico-optical band structure of 14 distinct materials. We choose Si, Ge, InAs, GaAs, CdTe, and others from Group IV, III-V, and II-VI due to their technological relevance but our framework is readily applicable to a wide range of emerging 2D and 3D materials. In stark contrast to the macroscopic refractive index of these materials used widely today, this picophotonic framework shows that hidden waves exist throughout the crystal lattice and have unique pico-polarization texture and crowding. We also present an open-source software package, Purdue-PicoMax, for the research community to discover hidden waves in new materials like hBN, graphene, and Moire materials. Our work establishes a foundational crystallographic feature to discover novel pico-optical waves in light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Digital and Analog Laser Synchronization System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser synchronization is a technique that locks the wavelength of a free-running laser to that of the reference laser, thereby enabling synchronous changes in the wavelengths of the two lasers. This technique is of crucial importance in both scientific and industrial applications. Conventional synchronization systems, whether digital or analog, have intrinsic limitations in terms of accuracy or bandwidth. The hybrid "digital + analog" system can address this shortcoming. However, all above systems face the challenge of achieving an both high locking accuracy and low structural complexity simultaneously. This paper presents a hybrid "digital + analog" laser synchronization system with low-complexity and high-performance. In the digital part, we proposed a electric intensity locking method based on a band-pass filter, which realizes the fluctuation of frequency offset between a single frequency laser (SFL) and a mode-locked laser (MLL) less than 350 kHz in 24 hours. Following the incorporation of the analog control component, frequency fluctuation is less than 2.5 Hz in 24 hours. By synchronizing two SFLs to a repetition-frequency locked MLL, we achieve indirect synchronization between SFLs with a frequency offset of 10.6 GHz and fluctuation less than 5 Hz in 24 hours, demonstrating robust long- and short-term stability. Since the MLL is employed as a reference, the system can be utilized for cross-band indirect synchronization of multiple lasers. Based on the synchronization system, we propose a photonic-assisted microwave frequency identification scheme, which has detection error of less than 0.6 MHz. The high performance of the synchronization system enables the proposed frequency identification scheme to achieve high measurement accuracy and a theoretically large frequency range.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of measurement position in Brillouin optical correlation-domain reflectometry based on Rayleigh noise spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin optical correlation-domain reflectometry (BOCDR) is unique in its ability to measure distributed strain and temperature changes along a fiber under test (FUT) from a single end, offering random access and relatively high spatial resolution, making it promising for infrastructure monitoring. BOCDR achieves spatial resolution through frequency modulation of the laser output, and this modulation frequency determines the measurement position, necessitating accurate association of modulation frequencies with positions on the FUT. However, a practical method to precisely correlate modulation frequency values with FUT positions has not yet been proposed. This study introduces a method leveraging the change in Rayleigh noise spectrum with modulation frequency to accurately associate these frequencies with positions on the FUT. The effectiveness of this method is proved through distributed strain measurement.</description>

      <title>Integrated Mode-Hop-Free Tunable Lasers at 780 nm for Chip-Scale Classical and Quantum Photonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, remarkable advances in integrated photonic technologies have enabled table-top experiments and instrumentation to be scaled down to compact chips with significant reduction in size, weight, power consumption, and cost. Here, we demonstrate an integrated continuously tunable laser in a heterogeneous gallium arsenide-on-silicon nitride (GaAs-on-SiN) platform that emits in the far-red radiation spectrum near 780 nm, with 20 nm tuning range, &lt;6 kHz intrinsic linewidth, and a &gt;40 dB side-mode suppression ratio. The GaAs optical gain regions are heterogeneously integrated with low-loss SiN waveguides. The narrow linewidth lasing is achieved with an extended cavity consisting of a resonator-based Vernier mirror and a phase shifter. Utilizing synchronous tuning of the integrated heaters, we show mode-hop-free wavelength tuning over a range larger than 100 GHz (200 pm). To demonstrate the potential of the device, we investigate two illustrative applications: (i) the linear characterization of a silicon nitride microresonator designed for entangled-photon pair generation, and (ii) the absorption spectroscopy and locking to the D1 and D2 transition lines of 87-Rb. The performance of the proposed integrated laser holds promise for a broader spectrum of both classical and quantum applications in the visible range, encompassing communication, control, sensing, and computing.</description>

      <title>Self-organized spatiotemporal quasi-phase-matching in microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-phase-matching (QPM) is a widely adopted technique for mitigating stringent momentum conservation in nonlinear optical processes such as second-harmonic generation (SHG). It effectively compensates for the phase velocity mismatch between optical harmonics by introducing a periodic spatial modulation to the nonlinear optical medium. Such a mechanism has been further generalized to the spatiotemporal domain, where a non-stationary spatial QPM can induce a frequency shift of the generated light. Here we demonstrate how a spatiotemporal QPM grating, consisting in a concurrent spatial and temporal modulation of the nonlinear response, naturally emerges through all-optical poling in silicon nitride microresonators. Mediated by the coherent photogalvanic effect, a traveling space-charge grating is self-organized, affecting momentum and energy conservation, resulting in a quasi-phase-matched and Doppler-shifted second harmonic. Our observation of the photoinduced spatiotemporal QPM expands the scope of phase matching conditions in nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime metamaterials (ST-MMs) are opening new regimes of light-matter interactions based on the breaking of temporal and spatial symmetries, as well as intriguing concepts associated with synthetic motion. In this work, we investigate the continuous spatiotemporal translation symmetry of ST-MMs with uniform modulation velocity. Using Noether theorem, we demonstrate that such symmetry entails the conservation of the energy-momentum. We highlight how energy-momentum conservation imposes constraints on the range of allowed light-matter interactions within ST-MMs, as illustrated with examples of the collision of electromagnetic and modulation pulses. Furthermore, we discuss the similarities and differences between the conservation of energy-momentum and relativistic effects. We believe that our work provides a step forward in clarifying the fundamental theory underlying ST-MMs.</description>

      <title>Post-Measurement Pairing Quantum Key Distribution with Local Optical Frequency Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of post-measurement coincidence pairing simplifies substantially long-distance, repeater-like quantum key distribution (QKD) by eliminating the need for tracking the differential phase of the users' lasers. However, optical frequency tracking remains necessary and can become a severe burden in future deployment of multi-node quantum networks. Here, we resolve this problem by referencing each user's laser to an absolute frequency standard and demonstrate a practical post-measurement pairing QKD with excellent long-term stability. We confirm the setup's repeater-like behavior and achieve a finite-size secure key rate (SKR) of 15.94 bit/s over 504 km fiber, which overcomes the absolute repeaterless bound by 1.28 times. Over a fiber length 100 km, the setup delivers an impressive SKR of 285.68 kbit/s. Our work paves the way towards an efficient muti-user quantum network with the local frequency standard.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing Material Quantity and Terahertz Wave Interference Shielding Efficiency with Metallic Borophene Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in the terahertz (THz) regime, while minimizing the quantity used, are highly demanded for future information communication, healthcare and mineral resource exploration applications. Currently, there is often a trade-off between the amount of material used and the absolute EMI shielding effectiveness (EESt) for the EMI shielding materials. Here, we address this trade-off by harnessing the unique properties of two-dimensional (2D) beta12-borophene (beta12-Br) nanosheets. Leveraging beta12-Br's light weight and exceptional electron mobility characteristics, which represent among the highest reported values to date, we simultaneously achieve a THz EMI shield effectiveness (SE) of 70 dB and an EESt of 4.8E5 dB cm^2/g (@0.87 THz) using a beta12-Br polymer composite. This surpasses the values of previously reported THz shielding materials with an EESt less than 3E5 dB cm^2/g and a SE smaller than 60 dB, while only needs 0.1 wt.% of these materials to realize the same SE value. Furthermore, by capitalizing on the composite's superior mechanical properties, with 158% tensile strain at a Young's modulus of 33 MPa, we demonstrate the high-efficiency shielding performances of conformably coated surfaces based on beta12-Br nanosheets, suggesting their great potential in EMI shielding area.</description>

      <title>Optical alignment of contamination-sensitive Far-Ultraviolet spectrographs for Aspera SmallSat mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aspera is a NASA Astrophysics Pioneers SmallSat mission designed to study diffuse OVI emission from the warm-hot phase gas in the halos of nearby galaxies. Its payload consists of two identical Rowland Circle-type long-slit spectrographs, sharing a single MicroChannel plate detector. Each spectrograph channel consists of an off-axis parabola primary mirror and a toroidal diffraction grating optimized for the 1013-1057 Angstroms bandpass. Despite the simple configuration, the optical alignment/integration process for Aspera is challenging due to tight optical alignment tolerances, driven by the compact form factor, and the contamination sensitivity of the Far-Ultraviolet optics and detectors. In this paper, we discuss implementing a novel multi-phase approach to meet these requirements using state-of-the-art optical metrology tools. For coarsely positioning the optics we use a blue-laser 3D scanner while the fine alignment is done with a Zygo interferometer and a custom computer-generated hologram.

      <title>Optical Micromanipulation of Soft Materials: Applications in Devices and Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its invention by Arthur Ashkin and colleagues at Bell Labs in the 1970s, optical micromanipulation, also known as optical tweezers or laser tweezers, has evolved remarkably to become one of the most convenient and versatile tools for studying soft materials, including biological systems. Arthur Ashkin received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for enabling these extraordinary scientific advancements. Essentially, a focused laser beam is used to apply and measure minuscule forces from a few piconewtons to femtonewtons by utilizing light-matter interaction at mesoscopic length scales. Combined with advanced microscopy and position-sensing techniques, optical micromanipulations enable us to investigate diverse aspects of functional soft materials. These include studying mechanical responses through force-elongation measurements, examining the structural properties of complex fluids employing microrheology, analyzing chemical compositions using spectroscopy, and sorting cells through single-cell analysis. Furthermore, it is utilized in various soft-matter-based devices, such as laser scissors and optical motors in microfluidic channels. This chapter presents an overview of optical micromanipulation techniques by describing fundamental theories and explaining the design considerations of conventional single-trap and dual-trap setups as well as recent improvisations. We further discuss their capabilities and applications in probing exotic soft-matter systems and in developing widely utilized devices and technologies based on functional soft materials.</description>

      <title>Retinomorphic Feature Detection and Machine Vision in a Network Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological vision systems seamlessly integrate feature-sensitive spatial processing and strong nonlinearity. The retina performs feature detection via ganglion cells, which nonlinearly enhance image features such as edges through lateral inhibition processes between neighbouring cells. As demand for specialised machine learning hardware increases, physical systems are sought which combine feature detection with the nonlinear processing required for tasks such as image classification. Currently, physical machine vision schemes detect features linearly, then employ separate digital systems for subsequent nonlinear activation. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using a semiconductor network laser. The system hosts many spatially-overlapping lasing modes which detect multiple image features in parallel via their lasing amplitude. Integrated nonlinearity is provided by antagonistic competition for gain between modes - a photonic analogue of the lateral inhibition in retinal cells. Detected feature maps are fed back through the system, providing multi-layer image classification with intrinsic nonlinear processing. Accuracies of 98.05% and 87.85% are achieved for MNIST digits and Fashion-MNIST tasks respectively.</description>

      <title>Flux-mediated effective Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in an impurity decorated diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In flat-band systems with non-orthogonal compact localized states (CLSs), onsite perturbations couple neighboring CLSs and generate exponentially-decaying impurity states, whose degree of localization depends on lattice parameters. In this work, a diamond chain with constant magnetic flux per plaquette is decorated with several controlled onsite impurities in a patterned arrangement, generating an effective system that emerges from the flat band. The coupling distribution of the effective system is determined by the relative distance between impurities and the value of the flux, which can be chosen to engineer a wide variety of models. We employ a staggered distribution of impurities that effectively produces the well-known Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show that the topological edge states display an enhanced robustness to non-chiral disorder due to an averaging effect over their extension. Finally, we provide a route to implement the system experimentally using optical waveguides that guide orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. This work opens the way for the design of topologically protected impurity states in other flat-band systems or physical platforms with non-orthogonal bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic frequency mixers are fundamental building blocks of electronic systems. Harmonic frequency mixing in particular enables broadband electromagnetic signal analysis across octaves of spectrum using a single local oscillator. However, conventional harmonic frequency mixers do not operate beyond hundreds of GHz to a few THz. If extended to the petahertz scale in a compact and scalable form, harmonic mixers would enable field-resolved optical signal analysis spanning octaves of spectra in a monolithic device without the need for frequency conversion using nonlinear crystals. Here we demonstrate lightwave-electronic harmonic frequency mixing beyond 0.350 PHz using plasmonic nanoantennas. We demonstrate that the mixing process enables complete, field-resolved detection of spectral content far outside that of the local oscillator, greatly extending the range of detectable frequencies compared to conventional heterodyning techniques. Our work has important implications for applications where optical signals of interest exhibit coherent femtosecond-scale dynamics spanning multiple harmonics.</description>

      <title>A Broadband Algorithm for Adiabatic Mode Evolution and its Application on Polarization Splitter-Rotator on LNOI Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic mode evolution waveguides (AMEWs) are widely utilized in integrated photonics, including tapered waveguides, edge couplers, mode converters, splitters, etc. An analytical theory and a novel AMEW design algorithm are developed to create shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA). This new algorithm is effective in shortening the total length of the AMEW while maintaining the desired wavelength range. Moreover, this analytical algorithm requires much fewer computing resources than traditional numerical algorithms. With the new algorithm, we demonstrate a broadband and highly efficient polarization splitter-rotator (PSR) on a lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform with an LN thickness of 500 nm. According to our simulation, the length of the PSR is shortened by 3.5 times compared to the linear design. The fabricated PSR, with a total length of 2 mm, exhibits an insertion loss (IL) of 0.8 dB and a polarization extinction ratio (ER) of 12.2 dB over a wavelength range exceeding 76 nm.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale cuticle density variations correlate with pigmentation and color in butterfly wing scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How pigment distribution correlates with cuticle density within a microscopic butterfly wing scale, and how both impact final reflected color remains unknown. We used ptychographic X-ray computed tomography to quantitatively determine, at nanoscale resolutions, the three-dimensional mass density of scales with pigmentation differences. By comparing cuticle densities between pairs of scales with pigmentation differences, we determine that the density of the lower lamina is inversely correlated with pigmentation. In the upper lamina structure, low pigment levels also correlate with sheet-like chitin structures as opposed to rod-like structures. Within each scale, we determine that the lower lamina in all scales has the highest density and distinct layers within the lower lamina help explain reflected color. We hypothesize that pigments, in addition to absorbing specific wavelengths, can affect cuticle polymerization, density, and refractive index, thereby impacting reflected wavelengths that produce colors.</description>

      <title>Optimal multiple-phase estimation with multi-mode NOON states against photon loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-mode NOON states can quantum-enhance multiple-phase estimation in the absence of photon loss. However, a multi-mode NOON state is known to be vulnerable to photon loss, and its quantum-enhancement can be dissipated by lossy environment. In this work, we demonstrate that a quantum advantage in estimate precision can still be achieved in the presence of photon loss. This is accomplished by optimizing the weights of the multi-mode NOON states according to photon loss rates in the multiple modes, including the reference mode which defines the other phases. For practical relevance, we also show that photon-number counting via a multi-mode beam-splitter achieves the useful, albeit sub-optimal, quantum advantage. We expect this work to provide valuable guidance for developing quantum-enhanced multiple-phase estimation techniques in lossy environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear quantum photonics serves as a cornerstone in photonic quantum technologies, such as universal quantum computing and quantum communications. The emergence of integrated photonics platform not only offers the advantage of large-scale manufacturing but also provides a variety of engineering methods. Given the complexity of integrated photonics engineering, a comprehensive simulation framework is essential to fully harness the potential of the platform. In this context, we introduce a nonlinear quantum photonics simulation framework which can accurately model a variety of features such as adiabatic waveguide, material anisotropy, linear optics components, photon losses, and detectors. Furthermore, utilizing the framework, we have developed a device scheme, chip-scale temporal walk-off compensation, that is useful for various quantum information processing tasks. Applying the simulation framework, we show that the proposed device scheme can enhance the squeezing parameter of photon-pair sources and the conversion efficiency of quantum frequency converters without relying on higher pump power.</description>

      <title>Suppression of noise in separation estimation of optical sources with spatial-mode demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial mode demultiplexing was proved to be a successful tool for estimation of the separation between incoherent sources, allowing for sensitivity much below the Rayleigh limit. However, with the presence of measurement's noise, superresolution brought by this technique deteriorates rapidly. On a formal ground, this can be seen in terms of, so called, Rayleigh curse known from direct imaging, which while being absent for ideal spatial mode demultiplexing, goes back in a noisy scenario. In this article, we develop a formal procedure to suppress the destructive effect of the noise, proposing a procedure effectively working as an error correction. For noise models given by a random unitary channel generated by a polynomial of creation and annihilation operators, we demonstrate that perfect noise decoupling can be reached by repeating the mode demultiplexers and intervening them by a group of rotations, in the limit of a large number of repetitions and small noise strength. For a special case of displacement noise, our solution is simplified: by using the demultiplexer twice, and interlacing it by a parity operator, given that the noise configuration is frozen between the first and the second step, a perfect decoupling can be achieved. This allows for a recovery of superresolution for a special class of noise generated by displacement operators. Furthermore, for a strong noise correlation between these two steps, our protocol provides an improved measurement resolution.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Classification and reconstruction for single-pixel imaging with classical and quantum neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-pixel cameras are effective solution for imaging outside the visible spectrum where traditional CMOS/CCD cameras have challenges. Combined with machine learning, they can analyze images quickly enough for practical applications. Solving the problem of high-dimensional single-pixel visualization can potentially be accelerated using quantum machine learning, thereby expanding the range of practical problems. In this work we simulated a single-pixel imaging experiment using Hadamard basis patterns, where images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset were used as objects. There were selected 64 measurements with maximum variance (6% of the number of pixels in the image). We created algorithms for classifying and reconstruction images based on these measurements using classical fully connected neural networks and parameterized quantum circuits. Classical and quantum classifiers showed accuracies of 96% and 95% respectively after 6 training epochs, which is quite competitive result. Image reconstruction was also demonstrated using classical and quantum neural networks after 10 training epochs, the structural similarity index measure values were 0.76 and 0.25, respectively, which indicates that the problem in such a formulation turned out to be too difficult for quantum neural networks in such a configuration for now.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.</description>
