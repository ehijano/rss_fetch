      <title>Hairy black hole solutions in nonlocal quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hairy black hole solutions are constructed within quantum-inspired nonlocal quadratic gravity. Nonlocal effects induce Yukawa screening, which shifts the event horizon inward and modifies both the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy and the Hawking temperature, while also renormalizing the chemical potential. Nonlocal corrections also reduce the magnitude of the negative specific heat, making small hairy black holes more stable, with Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies consistent with the absence of first-order phase transitions. The nonlocal spin-2 propagator contains, in addition to the massless graviton, a massive pole with positive residue and positive norm. Consequently, hairy black holes in nonlocal quadratic gravity are free of ghost instabilities at the quadratic and classical levels, in the effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy of black strings in an Anti-de Sitter background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical double copy for static black string solutions in an Anti--de Sitter (AdS) background. By casting the black string metric into Kerr--Schild form over a cylindrical AdS geometry, we construct the corresponding single and zeroth copies. The single copy describes a gauge field satisfying Maxwell-like equations and sourced by an effective line of color charge, while the zeroth copy is given by a scalar field conformally coupled to the AdS background. We also extend the analysis to charged black strings, identifying the associated modifications in the gauge sector. These results show that the classical double copy consistently applies to extended gravitational objects in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Elastic and Inelastic Two-particle Scatterings at High Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement produced in transverse momentum by two-particle scattering at high energy. Employing the S-matrix framework for the derivation of reduced density matrices, we formulate the entanglement entropy for an inelastic scattering as well as an elastic one. We display the formulas of the entanglement entropy in terms of two-body cross sections. We also derive the entanglement density as a function of the transverse momentum. As an application, we then focus on both forward elastic ($pn \to pn$) and inelastic ($pn \to np$) channels scattering allowing for a fruitful comparison of the two reactions with the same proton-neutron content. We evaluate the elastic and inelastic entanglement entropy by using known parameterizations of experimental data for neutron-proton reactions. Comparing those entanglement entropies, we observe that the inelastic scattering produces more overall entanglement than the elastic one in the $pn$ sector.</description>

      <title>Chaos in the near-horizon dynamics of the dyonic $\rm{AdS_4}$-Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chaos in the dynamics of a probe massless particle confined by the harmonic potential near the horizon of the dyonic $\rm{AdS_4}$-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. The total energy of the particle, chemical potential and magnetic field in this system serving as independently adjustable parameters tune nonlinearity and phase-space structure. By analyzing the trajectories on the Poincar\'e section and evaluating the Lyapunov exponents, we obtain the dynamical phase diagrams of the chaos and find their counteracting regulatory role: at low energy, chaos is enhanced and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ violates its upper bound (i.e. surface gravity) in the extremal black hole limit(combined paramete $\Gamma=3$); at high energy, the same extremal limit suppresses chaos, with $\lambda_L$ dropping to zero and a regular dynamical corridor emerging along $\Gamma=3$ in the dynamical phase diagrams. These results establish a direct mapping between black hole thermodynamics and microscopic chaos, offering new insights into the AdS/QCD correspondence and nonlinear dynamics in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Undecidability in Spacetime Geometry via the AdS/CFT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undecidability, a hallmark of G\"odel incompleteness theorems, has recently emerged in quantum many-body physics through the spectral gap problem. We demonstrate how this logical limitation can be holographically transmitted to a class of gravitational theories via the AdS/CFT correspondence. By embedding a translationally invariant spin Hamiltonian with undecidable gap status into a large-N gauge theory, we generate an AdS dual in which the selection of dominant bulk saddle (Poincar\'e AdS or AdS soliton) is itself undecidable. Consequently, under standard semiclassical holographic assumptions, even determining which smooth spacetime geometry emerges from quantum gravity can be beyond the limits of computability.</description>

      <title>A note on the Holographic model for color superconductivity in d-dimension without confinement phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we will generalize the concept of the holography for the color superconductivity (CSC) phase becomes to d-dimension AdS instead of 6d. The dual field theory live in (d-1)-dimension $SU(N_c)$ and have no confinement phase contradiction with the QCD color superconductivity. And we will try to use holographic model with Einstein-Maxwell gravity in d dimension AdS and we study this phase with $N_c\geq 2$. And after, we will discuss the equation of state of the color superconductivity in $d=4$ case without confinement via holography</description>

      <title>Exact black holes and black branes with bumpy horizons supported by superfluid pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.</description>

      <title>Open strings on knot complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using skein valued holomorphic curve counting techniques, we give a flow loop formula for the skein valued partition function of the Lagrangian knot complement of a fibered knot (of the $A$-model open topological strings with Lagrangian $A$-branes wrapping the complement) in the cotangent bundle of the three-sphere and in the resolved conifold. For torus knots we show that the partition function in the cotangent bundle localizes on two or three holomorphic annuli and give a corresponding generalized quiver structure for the partition function in the resolved conifold.
  We connect the formula to the augmentation curve, the representation variety of the knot contact homology algebra of the knot, generated by Reeb chords of its Legendrian conormal and with differential given by holomorphic disks interpolating between words of Reeb chords. The curve admits a quantization as a $q$-difference equation for the generating function of symmetrically colored HOMFLYPT-polynomials of the knot or, geometrically, for the $U(1)$-partition function of the knot conormal. For $(2,2p+1)$-torus knots we show that, after a change of variables, the partition function of the knot complement also satisfies this $q$-difference equation. This gives another geometrically defined coordinate chart for the $D$-module defined by the quantized augmentation polynomial.</description>

      <title>A novel Hamiltonian formulation of $1+1$ dimensional $\phi^4$ theory in Daubechies wavelet basis: momentum space analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to study field theories in the nonperturbative Hamiltonian framework. Specifically, we make use of Daubechies wavelets in momentum space. These basis elements are characterised by a resolution and a translation index that provides for a natural nonperturbative infrared and ultraviolet truncation of the quantum field theory. As an application, we consider the $\phi^4$ theory and demonstrate the emergence of the well-known nonperturbative strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2&gt;0$ sector.</description>

      <title>Relational de Sitter State Counting with an SU(3) Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Maldacena's observer-centric formulation of de~Sitter physics \cite{Maldacena:2024spf}, we develop an observer-dependent state-counting framework in Euclidean de~Sitter space by modeling the observer as a massive equatorial worldline carrying an SU(3) clock. Starting from the gauge-fixed graviton path integral on $S^D$, we trace the one-loop phase $\ii^{D+2}$ to a finite set of scalar and conformal Killing modes and show that, once the worldline is included, the $(D-1)$ transverse negative modes cancel the corresponding $(D-1)$ conformal Killing directions mode by mode. The residual fixed-$\beta$ phase from the global conformal factor and reparametrizations is removed by imposing the Hamiltonian constraint $H_{\text{patch}} - H_{\text{clock}} - \nu = 0$ via a Bromwich inverse Laplace transform, which under explicit complete-monotonicity assumptions yields a real and positive microcanonical density. We stress that this positivity statement is conditional on Assumptions (A1)--(A3) and is established at one loop about the round $S^D$ saddle in the probe regime $G E_{\rm clock}/R\ll 1$; a self-consistent backreacting or higher-loop extension is a natural next step. In earlier work \cite{Ali:2025wld,Ali:2024rnw} we argued that unbroken SU(3) confinement at $T\to 0$ can account for the observed value of the cosmological constant and for the origin of the fundamental constants $(\hbar,G,c)$ as effective couplings fixed by the SU(3) vacuum structure; this makes SU(3) the natural candidate for the internal clock of de~Sitter, whose radius and temperature are themselves set by the same cosmological constant. This idea is implemented with three explicit SU(3) realizations (qutrit, Cartan weight-lattice, and $U(1)^2$ rotor), for which the observer-inclusive density of states factorizes into a universal gravity factor, a universal worldline residue, and a clock-dependent SU(3) weight.</description>

      <title>Allowable complex metrics and the gravitational index of AdS$_5$ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten criterion for the allowability of complex metrics, in the context of the gravitational path integral that calculates the supersymmetric index. We focus on the saddle points that capture the contribution of supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5$ space. We show that, for such black holes with two independent angular momenta, the conditions imposed on the corresponding saddle point by the KSW criterion are equivalent to the ones arising from the convergence of the microscopic trace form of the supersymmetric index. This result adds to previous results establishing such an equivalence in other, simpler examples of the gravitational index in AdS space and flat space. Along the way, we give a practical algorithm for implementing the KSW criterion in terms of eigenvalues of certain matrices.</description>

      <title>Light-like Wilson loops and the $\bar{Q}$-equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work we began a study of the correlators of multiple light-like Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, focussing primarily on tree-level calculations and, beyond tree-level, to the Abelian theory. Here we calculate $O(g^2)$ correlators of multiple light-like Wilson loops in the $SU(N)$ theory. We use the chiral box expansion and a study of the leading singularities of the loop integrand to arrive at integrated expressions for these objects. We then use the results of these calculations to verify that a natural generalisation of the $\bar{Q}$-equation, familiar from the study of single Wilson loops, holds in the $SU(N)$ theory. This $\bar{Q}$-equation should provide a valuable tool for the computation of multiple Wilson loop correlators at higher order in the coupling.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian R-symmetry and dielectric branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the holographic realization of the $SO(6)_R$ R-symmetry of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills with unitary gauge group. Focusing on 1/2 BPS states in the $[0,J,0]$ representation of $SO(6)_R$, it is known that depending on the scaling of $J$ with $N$, these are best described holographically in terms of gravitational waves ($J\ll N$) or D3 brane giant gravitons ($J\sim N$). These two descriptions are bridged by the dielectric effect, as the D3 giant can be regarded as a puffed-up configuration of gravitational waves. The natural non-BPS branes for symmetry operators are either 4-branes or non-BPS Kaluza-Klein monopoles. We show that the former can be regarded as a dielectric expansion of the latter, in parallel to the charged operators. We also propose symTh and symTFT candidates for the $SO(6)_R$ symmetry, whose operators at the boundary must correspond to the non-BPS branes.</description>

      <title>One loop photon-graviton mixing in an electromagnetic field: Part 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field is a well-known prediction of Einstein-Maxwell theory. First discussed at tree-level by Gertsenshtein in 1962, more recently it has been shown to lead to magnetic dichroism starting from one-loop. While previously only two diagrams were assumed to contribute to this one-loop photon-graviton amplitude in a constant electromagnetic field, here we point out the existence of a third one involving a tadpole subdiagram. As shown by H. Gies and one of the authors in 2016 for the pure QED case, such diagrams cannot be omitted in general even though the tadpole formally vanishes. After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all three diagrams. Although phenomenologically this amplitude is mainly of interest for the case of the spinor loop in a magnetic field, here we will also include the scalar loop and the electric field component, since the computational effort is essentially the same. We show that the tadpole diagram, although contributing to the amplitude, does not contribute to the magnetic dichroism. The gravitational Ward identity provides a useful check.</description>

      <title>When inflationary perturbations refuse to classicalise: the role of non-Gaussianity in Wigner negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary perturbations are quantum in origin. Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Probing Entanglement and Symmetries in Random States Using a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems display an extraordinary degree of complexity, yet many of their features are universal: they depend not on microscopic details, but on a few fundamental physical aspects such as symmetries. A central challenge is to distill these universal characteristics from model-specific ones. Random quantum states sampled from a uniform distribution, the Haar measure, provide a powerful framework for capturing this typicality. Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models. We find excellent agreement with the predictions from the Haar-random state ensemble. First, we measure the R\'enyi-2 entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size, observing the Page curve. Second, we probe the subsystem symmetries using entanglement asymmetry. Finally, we measure the moments of partially transposed reduced density matrices obtained by tracing out part of the system in the generated ensembles, thereby revealing distinct entanglement phases. Our results offer an experimental perspective on the typical entanglement and symmetries of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the energy-momentum squared gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we have revisited the energy-momentum squared gravity theory, by taking into account the second derivative of the matter Lagrangian with respect to the metric, encapsulating relations originated from thermodynamical grounds. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the energy-momentum squared gravity with the new corrections, we have analyzed the physical implications by relying on the linear stability theory. The results show that the current cosmological system is compatible with the expansion of the Universe for some specific matter Lagrangians, explaining the emergence of matter domination era, approaching the late time accelerated expansion era close to the de-Sitter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A Maximum Entropy Conjecture for Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final state of a binary black hole merger is predicted with high precision by numerical relativity, but could there be a simple thermodynamic principle within general relativity that governs the selection of the remnant? Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Energy as a Source for Wormholes in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traversable wormhole solutions are explored in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathbb{T})$ gravity, a curvature--matter extension in which $\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar and $\mathbb{T}$ denotes the trace of the energy--momentum tensor. To generate explicit wormhole models, we prescribe holographic dark-energy densities based on entropy formalism proposed by R\'enyi, Moradpour, and Bekenstein--Hawking, namely \[ \rho_{\textit{R}} = \frac{\alpha}{4\alpha_1 r^4 c^2 \kappa}\ln\!\left(1+\pi \alpha_1 r^2\right), \qquad \rho_{\textit{M}} = \frac{\alpha}{4\pi r^2 c^2 \kappa \left(\pi \alpha_1 r^2 + 1\right)}, \qquad \rho_{\textit{BH}} = \frac{\alpha}{4 c^2 \kappa r^2}, \] with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carrying dimensions of $L^{-2}$. The corresponding shape functions obtained from the field equations satisfy the standard throat and flare-out requirements for traversability. We then study how varying $\alpha$ and $\beta$ affects (i) the balance of forces associated with equilibrium and (ii) the status of the energy conditions. In particular, the null energy condition is found to be violated, indicating that exotic matter (or an effective exotic sector) is required to support the wormhole geometry. The spatial structure of the solutions is further visualized through embedding surfaces.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Corrections to Scalar Field Effective Action in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-loop effective action for a test scalar field in a general Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, specifically focusing on quantum corrections up to the second order in the interaction strength. By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we derive the equation of motion for the field expectation value, which incorporates not only the standard local radiative corrections but also novel nonlocal features: a memory term and a stochastic noise term. We identify all ultraviolet divergent structures within these nonlocal terms and provide a consistent renormalization procedure. To analyze the physical impact of these terms, we apply a local approximation under the assumption of slowly-varying fields, by which the memory term acts as a negative contribution to the drift coefficient. As a concrete application, we consider a massive $\phi^4$ theory and show that these one-loop corrections lead to a suppression of the field variance in the infrared regime compared to the tree-level results.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of magnetoviscous warped discs around compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion discs that are tilted with respect to their compact hosts can warp out-of-plane through general relativistic frame-dragging. Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>A complex-linear reformulation of Hamilton--Jacobi theory and the emergence of quantum structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical mechanics admits multiple equivalent formulations, from Newton's equations to the variational Lagrange-Hamilton framework and the scalar Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) theory. In the HJ formulation, classical ensembles evolve through the continuity equation for a real density $\rho = R^{2}$ coupled to Hamilton's principal function $S$. Here we develop a complementary formulation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Schr\"odinger (HJS) theory, by embedding the pair $(R,S)$ into a single complex field. Starting from a completely general complex ansatz $\psi = f(R,S) e^{i g(R,S)}$, and imposing two minimal structural requirements, we obtain a unique map $\psi = R e^{iS/\kappa}$ together with a linear HJS equation whose $|\kappa| \to 0$ limit reproduces the HJ formulation exactly. Remarkably, when $\mathrm{Re}(\kappa)\neq 0$, essential features of quantum mechanics, including superposition, operator algebra, commutators, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Born's rule, and unitary evolution, arise naturally as consistency conditions. HJS thus provides a unified mathematical viewpoint in which classical and quantum dynamics appear as different limits of a single underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Geometric Selection Rules for Singularity Formation in Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the polynomial degeneracies of curvature invariants can act as geometric selection rules for spacetime singularities in modified theories of gravity. The degeneracies arise purely from the algebraic structure of Riemannian geometry and impose non-trivial constraints on the effective energy-momentum tensor. We derive these constraints for metric $f(R)$ gravity and a wide class of scalar-tensor theories to show that a singularity formation is generally occluded by curvature and/or scalar-induced anisotropies. Therefore, formation of a singularity in modified theories of gravity is not always a generic outcome but can occur only along algebraically admissible branches selected by Riemannian curvature invariants.</description>

      <title>Local finiteness for real-virtual corrections to electroweak production in partonic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a local subtraction scheme that enables the combined integration of loop momenta and the final-state parton phase space in real-virtual NNLO QCD corrections to cross sections for hadroproduction of electroweak and other colorless states. All initial- and final-state infrared singularities are subtracted at the integrand level in momentum space, yielding a locally finite integral ready for numerical integration in four dimensions. The subtraction terms are all based on the well-understood process of single-Higgs production. The core of our subtraction scheme relies on achieving local factorization in all infrared limits of real and virtual momenta. This necessitates systematic modifications of the original Feynman integrand for loop amplitudes, enabling gauge symmetry cancellations before performing integrations. Our approach provides an essential step toward NNLO cross-section calculations for hadron collider processes, where both loop and phase-space integrations are carried out numerically.</description>

Abstract: We show how various constructions of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie superalgebras are related to each other. These Lie superalgebras have a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ as the subalgebra at degree 0, an odd $\mathfrak{g}$-module V as the subspace at degree 1, and an embedding tensor as an element at degree -1. This is a linear map from V to $\mathfrak{g}$ satisfying a quadratic constraint, which equips V with the structure of a Leibniz algebra.</description>

      <title>Compact U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory in Superconducting Circuits with Infinite-Dimensional Local Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting-circuit architecture that realizes a compact U(1) lattice gauge theory using the intrinsic infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of phase and charge variables. The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime. The required circuit parameters are within the current experimental capabilities. Our results establish superconducting circuits as a scalable, continuous-variable platform for analog quantum simulation of non-perturbative gauge dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new causal spinfoam vertex for $4$d Lorentzian quantum gravity. The causal data are encoded in Toller $T$-matrices, which add to Wigner $D$-matrices $T^{(+)}+T^{(-)}=D$, and for which we provide a Feynman $\mathrm{i}\varepsilon$ representation. We discuss how the Toller poles cancel in the EPRL vertex, how the Livine-Oriti model is obtained in the Barrett-Crane limit, and how spinfoam causal data are distinct from Regge causal data. In the large-spin limit, we show that only Lorentzian Regge geometries with causal data compatible with the spinfoam data are selected, resulting in a single exponential $\exp(+\mathrm{i}\, S_{\mathrm{Regge}}/\hbar)$ and a new form of causal rigidity.</description>

Abstract: We study classical localised configurations - solitons - in a theory of self-interacting complex Proca field with the global $U(1)$ symmetry. We focus on spherically-symmetric solitons near the nonrelativistic limit, which are supported by the quartic interactions of the neutral Proca field. Such solitons can source the radial electric (magnetic) field if one introduces a parity-even (parity-odd) coupling of the Proca field to the electromagnetic field tensor. We discuss the conditions of existence of such nontopological ''electromagnetic hedgehogs'' and their properties.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten criterion for allowable complex metrics, in the context of the gravitational path integral corresponding to the supersymmetric index. In various theories of supergravity in asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS space, the exponential growth of states of the corresponding microscopic index in string theory is known to be captured by complex saddle points of this path integral. We compare the KSW criterion for these complex saddles against constraints from geometric consistency and the convergence of microscopic indices for the same saddles. In all the situations we consider, we find that the three criteria precisely agree with each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel physical picture to understand certain universal properties of the GUE matrix model which are typically ascribed to quantum chaos, i.e. the ramp and the plateau. We argue that these features should instead be associated with a pattern of spontaneous (or weak explicit) symmetry breaking. In this language, the GUE matrix model corresponds to an effective theory that describes the symmetry-broken phase, and where the Hermitian matrix of the GUE should be understood as a massive $\sigma$ field. The physics of this symmetry-broken phase governs certain particular features of the ramp such as its length and shape. However, the simple existence of a ramp is more universal and phase independent; it is related to sum rules obeyed by a large class of matrix models that constrain the interpolation to the plateau regime. Finally, the plateau is controlled by the symmetry-restored phase, which we call confined chaos.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in momentum space: restoring ${\cal C}{\cal P}{\cal T}$ invariance of $\kappa$-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The positive and negative energy modes of a field theory in $\kappa$-Minkowski/$\kappa$-Poincar\'e noncommutative spacetime have very different symmetry properties. This can be understood geometrically by considering that they span two distinct sectors of a curved momentum space. By performing an explicit direct computation of the relativistic Noether charges and their algebra within the canonical formalism, we identify a striking consequence of this asymmetry in momentum space: charge conjugation and Poincar\'e invariance are incompatible. We then notice how the structure of momentum space suggests that time reversal could be deformed so that the overall ${\cal C}{\cal P}{\cal T}$-invariance is restored. We prove that this new proposal works by studying the transformation properties under deformed discrete symmetries of the new relativistic charges.</description>

      <title>Quantising Chiral Bosons On Riemann Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sen's action in two dimensions governs a chiral boson coupled to a two-dimensional metric together with a second chiral boson that couples to a flat two-dimensional metric. This second scalar decouples from the physical degrees of freedom. The generalisation of this action to one in which the second chiral scalar couples to an arbitrary second metric is used to formulate the theory on an arbitrary two-dimensional manifold. We use this action with both metrics Riemannian (or complex) to formulate the path integral on any Riemann surface. We calculate the partition function in this way and check the result with that calculated using canonical quantisation, and then extend this to multiple chiral bosons. The partition function for chiral scalars taking values on a rational torus is a sum of terms, each of which is the product of two holomorphic functions, one a function of the modulus of the first metric and the other a function of the modulus of the second metric. In particular, for the case of chiral bosons moving on a torus defined by an even self-dual lattice, the partition function is a single product of two such holomorphic functions, not a sum of such terms. This is applied to the heterotic string to give a world-sheet action whose quantisation is modular invariant and free from anomalies. We discuss modular invariance for the moduli of both metrics and the extension to higher genus Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Toward an Effective Theory of the Volume Modulus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the 4-dimensional effective theory of the warped volume modulus in the presence of stabilizing effects from gaugino condensation by analyzing the linearized 10-dimensional supergravity equations of motion. Warping is generally expected to scale down the masses of bulk modes to the IR scale at the tip of a throat. We find that the mass of the warped volume modulus evades expectations and is largely insensitive to the effects of warping, even in strongly warped backgrounds. Instead, the mass is parametrically tied to the 4-dimensional AdS curvature scale $m^2 \sim {\mathcal O}(1) |\hat R_{\rm AdS}|$, presenting a challenge for scale separation in these backgrounds. We trace this effect to a universal contribution arising from the 10-dimensional equations of motion, and comment on the importance of a 10-dimensional treatment of the warped volume modulus for effective field theories and model building.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal defects spontaneously break part of the symmetry algebra of a bulk CFT. We show that the broken Ward identities imply very general sum rules on the defect CFT data as well as on the DOE data of bulk operators, which we call defect soft theorems. Our derivation is elementary, allowing us to easily reproduce and generalize constraints on displacement and tilt operators previously obtained in the literature as well as a plethora of new ones, including constraints on bulk-defect correlation functions. For line defects we rewrite constraints in dispersive sum rule form, showing they lead to exact, optimal bounds on the OPE data of the defect. We test these sum rules in concrete perturbative examples, finding perfect agreement with existing calculations and making new predictions for various dCFT data.</description>

      <title>Stable Evaluation of Lefschetz Thimble Intersection Numbers: Towards Real-Time Path Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a robust numerical method for determining intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings. Our approach employs the multiple shooting method to solve the upward flow equations from the saddle points to the original integration cycle, which also enables us to determine the signs of the intersection numbers. The method demonstrates stable and reliable performance, and has been tested for systems with up to $20$ variables, which can be further extended by adopting quadruple-precision arithmetic. We determine intersection numbers for several complex saddle points in a discretized path integral, providing new insights into the structure of real-time path integrals. The proposed method is broadly applicable to a wide range of problems involving oscillatory integrals in physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Yang-Mills Theories: Direct Internal Forces and Emerging Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional gauge-gravity unification based on the \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) gauge theory taken in a universal Yang--Mills type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is induced radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale, only a neutral tetrad associated with graviton and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. The matter sector clearly points to a deeper elementarity of \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

      <title>Probing the Singularity of Scalar-Haired Black Holes with Holographic Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that the "complexity=anything" observables allow more possibilities to probe the geometry behind the horizon of AdS black holes compared to the volume complexity. For uncharged black holes, these observables access the geometry all the way to the vicinity of the singularity, while for charged black holes, they only probe up to the inner horizon. Under appropriate conditions, the near-singularity geometry takes the universal form of a Kasner spacetime, characterized by the Kasner exponents. By introducing scalar hair, it is possible to continuously vary the Kasner exponents away from their vacuum values. In this work, we study the behavior of two different observables to determine whether they remain viable holographic duals of complexity in the presence of scalar hair. We also investigate how deeply these observables can probe the Kasner regime near the singularity. To this end, we consider two scalar potentials: an exponential potential, which admits analytic solutions, and a pure mass term, which requires numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The post-Minkowskian amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.</description>

Abstract: We construct in detail the irreducible representations of the BMS group with super rotations in three and four dimensions that have the same rest frame momenta as the massive and massless Poincare point particles. We compare these representations to those of the Poincare group and also to the analogous representations of global BMS. We argue that these extended BMS representations are carried by a string rather than a point particle. The super rotations play a crucial role in our discussions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we start by re-deriving the equations of motion and Bianchi identities for the abelian D4 brane worldvolume. Noting that the 4-flux in M-Theory is rationally flux quantized in a non-abelian cohomology theory called 4-cohomotopy, and the three-flux on the M5 brane worldvolume in rational (twisted) 3-cohomotopy, we compute the minimal model for the cyclification of the quaternionic Hopf fibration which encodes the Bianchi identities for the fluxes on the D4 brane worldvolume after double dimensional reduction. The two pictures can be mapped to each other, and thus at the rational level, we conjecture a non-abelian relative cohomology theory for the D4 brane, fibered over the 10d Type IIA spacetime fluxes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</description>

      <title>A novel Lagrange-multiplier approach to the effective-one-body dynamics of binary systems in post-Minkowskian gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the conservative dynamics of binary systems, within the effective one-body (EOB) framework, based on the use of a Lagrange multiplier to impose the mass-shell constraint. When applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) description of the two-body problem in Einsteinian gravity, this Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the conservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of EOB-PM Hamiltonians. Using state-of-the-art expressions of the resummed waveform and radiation reaction, we apply our new formalism to the construction of an aligned-spin, quasi-circular, inspiraling EOB waveform model, called {\tt LEOB-PM}, that incorporates analytical information up to the 4PM level, completed by 4PN contributions up to the sixth order in eccentricity, in the orbital sector, and by 4.5PN contributions, in the spin-orbit sector. In the nonspinning case, we find that an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers maximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness ${\bar{F}}_{\rm EOBNR}$ (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) varying between $0.2\%$ and $1\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity (NR) catalog up to mass ratio $q=15$. It also delivers excellent phasing agreement with the $q=32$ configuration of the RIT catalog. We also found consistency between binding energies within a few percent at the NR merger location. Then, when NR-informing the dynamics of the model (both orbital and spinning sectors) by using 17 SXS dataset, we find that the EOB/NR unfaithfulness (compared to 530 spin-aligned SXS waveforms) has a median value of $5.39\times 10^{-4}$, or $6.13\times 10^{-4}$ (depending on the spin-spin interactions), reaching at most $\sim 1\%$ in some of the high-spin corners.</description>

      <title>Prediction for Maximum Supercooling in SU(N) Confinement Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal confinement phase transition (PT) in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is first-order for $N\geq 3$, with bounce action scaling as $N^2$. Remarkably, lattice data for the action include a small coefficient whose presence likely strongly alters the PT dynamics. We give evidence, utilizing insights from softly-broken SUSY YM models, that the small coefficient originates from a deconfined phase instability just below the critical temperature. We predict the maximum achievable supercooling in $SU(N)$ theories to be a few percent, which can be tested on the lattice. We briefly discuss the potentially significant suppression of the associated cosmological gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Dirac quantum criticality in twisted double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of moir\'e double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides with ABBA stacking as a function of twist angle and applied pressure. At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moir\'e unit cell, the noninteracting system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the moir\'e Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moir\'e scale. Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2) spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. Within a renormalization group analysis of the most general symmetry-allowed low-energy field theory, we show that this semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$ four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Fermions in $AdS_2$ Black Hole: Chirality, Entanglement, and Spectral Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</description>

      <title>Exotic PeVatrons as sources of ultra-high-energy gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore novel classes of exotic astrophysical sources capable of producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays extending beyond the PeV scale, motivated by quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology. These sources include: ultra-spinning black hole vortex-string systems; exotic compact objects such as boson star, axion star and Q-ball. Such Exotica generate powerful magnetic fields through interactions with millicharged dark matter, enabling particle acceleration mechanisms that surpass the energy limits of conventional astrophysical sources like pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. We demonstrate that such exotic PeVatrons could be distributed throughout our Galaxy and may be detectable by current (LHAASO, HAWC) and next-generation (CTA) gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Fitting NANOGrav 15-year data and ACT data with modified inflation in entropic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent evidences of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) through Pulsar Time Array (PTA) observations hint towards an alternative inflationary scenario, compared to the usual inflation, for describing the early stage of the universe in order to be compatible with the PTA data. Moreover, currently the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines the constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018 measurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for suitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from the ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis), which reveal the model's compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data.</description>

      <title>Factorisation conditions and causality for local measurements in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum operations that are perfectly admissible in non-relativistic quantum theory can enable signalling between spacelike separated regions when naively imported into quantum field theory (QFT). Prominent examples of such "impossible measurements", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in "impossible measurement" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators.</description>

      <title>Multi-probe analysis of strong-field effects in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic equation for a neutral complex field as a probability amplitude is proposed. The continuity equation for the probability density is obtained. It is shown that there are two types of excitations of this field, which describe particles with positive energy and different dispersion laws. Based on the Lagrangian formalism, conservation laws are obtained. The transition to secondary quantization is considered.</description>

      <title>Exact Kerr-Newman-(A)dS and other spacetimes in bumblebee gravity: employing a novel generating technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that if the bumblebee field in the Einstein-bumblebee theory is given by its vacuum expectation value ($B_{\mu}=b_{\mu}$) and it is not dynamical ($\partial_{\mu}B_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}B_{\mu}=0$), then these conditions uniquely provide a generating technique, allowing us to construct exact solutions to bumblebee gravity from the vacuum solutions by adding a term $\sim b_{\mu}b_{\nu}$ to the metric tensor. Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of radiation from global strings and the relic axion density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss key aspects of the nature of radiation from global strings and its impact on the relic axion density. Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a ``hard'' spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a ``soft spectrum'' from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\rm a}\approx 160\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\approx 38\,{\rm GHz}$. If axions are emitted directly by the string network, and we use emission spectra reported in field theory simulations, then $m_{\rm a}\approx 4\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 1\,{\rm GHz}$, however this increases to $m_a \approx 125\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 30\,{\rm GHz}$ using our spectra for the case of an oscillating string. In all scenarios there are significant remaining uncertainties that we delineate.</description>
