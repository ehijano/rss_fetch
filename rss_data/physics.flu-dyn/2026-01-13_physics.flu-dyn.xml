      <title>Hard Constraint Projection in a Physics Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we embed hard constraints in a physics informed neural network (PINN) which predicts solutions to the 2D incompressible Navier Stokes equations. We extend the hard constraint method introduced by Chen et al. (arXiv:2012.06148) from a linear PDE to a strongly non-linear PDE. The PINN is used to estimate the stream function and pressure of the fluid, and by differentiating the stream function we can recover an incompressible velocity field. An unlearnable hard constraint projection (HCP) layer projects the predicted velocity and pressure to a hyperplane that admits only exact solutions to a discretised form of the governing equations.</description>

      <title>Localization of sources in weakly nonlinear fluid systems using linear and quadratic sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for localized source detection in dynamical systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations based on first and second-order sensitivity analysis. Building on the standard adjoint formulation, which relates multiple measurements to external sources through a linear duality relation, we first introduce a linear positional embedding that identifies the source location by aligning the measurement vector with the embedding. To capture weakly nonlinear effects that arise when the source intensity is finite, we then incorporate a quadratic correction represented as a symmetric bilinear operator and approximated via a truncated eigen-expansion obtained with Krylov subspace iterations. This yields quadratic positional embeddings that augment the linear adjoint field, enabling measurement data to be projected onto a higher-dimensional hyperplane, spanned by the linear and quadratic embeddings. A source search algorithm is formulated based on principal angle minimization between this hyperplane and the observation vector, providing a natural probabilistic interpretation of source location. The method operates in a one-shot fashion without iterative updates of candidate source positions, and it can be readily extended to scenarios involving multiple sources. Demonstrations on benchmark inverse problems include perturbation-source identification in the viscous Burgers equation and heat-source detection in a two-dimensional laminar stratified channel. The results with quadratic embeddings show significant improvements in localization accuracy compared with linear adjoint-based sensitivity methods, especially in the region where linear adjoint sensitivity vanishes.</description>

      <title>A Response to "Application of Gauss's Principle to the Classical Airfoil Lift Problem"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical theory of lift is confined to sharp edged airfoils. The search for a more general closure condition in potential flow remained elusive for over a century. Recently, a variational theory of lift, inspired by Gauss's principle of least constraint, was proposed as a remedy. The theory was shown to recover the Kutta condition as a special case for sharp-edged airfoils. However, recent criticism of the variational theory has asserted fundamental issues and discontinuities in its predictions. The present paper demonstrates that these assertions are incorrect and arise from inconsistencies with basic principles of analytical mechanics, the calculus of variations, and ideal-flow aerodynamics, as well as from misapplications of the variational theory itself. To resolve such misunderstandings, we review foundational concepts from analytical mechanics, including least action, Gauss's principle, and Hertz's principle; the definitions of impressed and constraint forces; and the distinction between actual work and virtual work. We then place these concepts in the context of incompressible fluid mechanics, utilizing the geometric interpretation of Helmholtz decomposition. In particular, we demonstrate that, for incompressible flows subject to the no-penetration boundary condition, the pressure force is orthogonal to the entire space of kinematically admissible flows and therefore performs no virtual work. The pressure force, thus, acts as the constraint force required to ensure the continuity constraint. From an aerodynamic perspective, we show that the classical and variational theories of lift, as well as any theory based on steady, irrotational motion, are necessarily reversible and therefore inapplicable to reversed-flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Rapid Prediction of Three-Dimensional Scour Flow around Bridge Piers via Body-Fitted Coordinate-Based U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows around bridge piers is a prerequisite for assessing local scour, a primary cause of infrastructure failure. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) captures complex flow features - such as horseshoe vortices - its high cost hinders real-time risk assessment. This study presents a physics-aware deep learning surrogate using a Body-Fitted Coordinate (BFC) system, BFC-UNet, designed to rapidly reconstruct 3D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions on curved domains. Unlike voxel-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) prone to staircase errors, the proposed architecture leverages a BFC system to predict the bed shear stress accurately. By transforming the physical O-grid into a canonical computational space, the model preserves the geometric integrity of the no-slip boundary. Trained on 2,304 simulations parameterized by inlet velocity and scour depth, BFC-UNet predicts velocity, pressure, and bed shear stress distributions with an R2 value of &gt; 0.98. It infers a full 3D domain (200,000 cells) in just 8 milliseconds on a single Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) - achieving a speed-up of five orders of magnitude over the CFD solver. Crucially, the model captures the topological evolution of vortex structures, including wake expansion and diving flows. These findings position BFC-UNet as a promising foundation for real-time digital twins, bridging rigorous fluid mechanics with data-driven efficiency.</description>

      <title>Transition from classical to ultimate melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting is omnipresent in nature and technology, with applications ranging from metallurgy, biology, food science, and latent thermal energy storage to oceanography, geophysics, and climate science, and occurring on all scales from sub-millimeter to global scales. The key objective is to understand the rate at which an object melts as a function of its size and of the ambient conditions. To achieve this it is important to be able to extrapolate from small scale experiments and observations to large or even global scales. This is done by scaling laws. However, these are only meaningful if there is no transition from one scaling relation to another one. Here we show, however, that for both fixed and freely-advected melting objects immersed in a turbulent flow a melting transition does exist, namely from slow melting at the small scales to fast melting at the large scales. We do so by controlled melting experiments and corresponding direct numerical simulations, covering four orders of magnitude in scale. The transition corresponds to the transition from a laminar-type boundary layer around the melting object to a turbulent-type boundary layer, i.e., from so-called classical turbulence to ultimate turbulence, with its enhanced transport properties. Our results thus provide a quantitative understanding of the flow physics of the melting process and thereby enable a better extrapolation and prediction of melt rates on large scales such as relevant in geophysics, oceanography, and climate science.</description>

      <title>Unsteady flow predictions around an obstacle using Geometry-Parameterized Dual-Encoder Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based flow field prediction is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics, offering significant computational efficiency advantage. In this work, we propose the Geometry-Parameterized Dual-Encoder Physics-Informed Neural Network (GP-DE-PINN) with a dual-encoder architecture for effective prediction of unsteady flow fields around parameterized geometries. This framework integrates a geometric parameter encoder to map low-dimensional shape parameters to high-dimensional latent features, coupled with a spatiotemporal coordinate encoder, and is trained under the Navier-Stokes equation constraints. Using 2D unsteady flow past petal-shaped cylinders as an example, we evaluate the model's reconstruction performance, generalization capability, and hyperparameter sensitivity. Results demonstrate that the GP-DE-PINN significantly outperforms the PINN with direct geometric input in flow field reconstruction, accurately capturing vortex shedding structures and pressure evolution, while exhibiting superior generalization accuracy on unseen geometric configurations. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses regarding geometric sampling and network width reveal the model's robustness to these hyperparameter variations. These findings illustrate that the proposed framework can serve as a robust and promising framework for predicting unsteady flows around complex geometric obstacles.</description>

      <title>CFD study of particle back-flow in pneumatic conveying systems due to triboelectrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industrial plants, pneumatic conveying systems are often used to convey particles from one location to another. Surprisingly, in bench-scale experiments, clusters of particles sometimes flow backward or upstream in the conveying channel. In this paper, the effect of electrostatic charge and forces on particle back-flow was investigated. Different conveying conditions with varying particle charges were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the resulting flow patterns were compared with CFD simulations of uncharged particles. In a channel flow with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise and spanwise directions, it was found that electrostatic forces drive particles into low-velocity regions but do not reverse their flow. When transporting particles through a finite-length duct, electrostatic forces cause particles to settle close to the duct's inlet. Finally, when particles were injected into the duct in a pulse, back-flow was observed once particles obtained a charge of 5.04 femto-coulombs or more. The electrostatic forces decelerated the particles at the tail of the pulse and ultimately reversed their direction, whereas the particles at the head of the pulse were accelerated. Thus, it was concluded that electrostatic forces can cause particle back-flow in pneumatic conveying systems if particles are fed discontinuously.</description>

      <title>The effect of discontinuous injection on particle back-flow in pneumatic conveying systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pneumatic conveying is used in many process industries to transport dry, granular, and powdered solids. The triboelectrification of particles during conveying causes particle agglomeration, spark discharges, and disruptions in particle flow, making particles move upstream against the fluid flow. The effect of frequency of particle injection on particle backflow is studied using CFD-DEM simulations. Conveying flow in a square-shaped duct with fluid frictional Reynold's number equal to 180, particle Stokes number equal to 8, and individual particle charge equal to 504 fC, is simulated with different particle injection frequencies. The proportion of particles moving upstream is found to increase as the delay period between injections increases, and the effect of the length of the injection period is minimal. Further, particles moving upstream are situated in low-drag zones at the corners of the duct where the electrostatic force dominates. In conclusion, the delay period between discontinuous injections plays a major role in particle backflow. The findings of the article are important for industrial processes with discontinuous injection of particles with a risk of particle accumulation within the conveying boundary.</description>

      <title>Interfacial standing wave-patterns disentangle dilatational and shear surface viscous effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilatational and shear surface viscosities are highly correlated parameters, making their individual contributions difficult to disentangle in Stokes flow, linearised flow models, or two-dimensional flows. We therefore investigate the three-dimensional interfacial standing waves as a means to decouple the influence of dilatational and shear surface viscosities. Two dimensionless controlling parameters are introduced: $Bq$, the total Boussinesq number, which quantifies the the relative importance of surface viscous stresses compared with bulk viscous stresses, and $\tan \chi$, which quantifies the ratio of surface dilatational viscosity to surface shear viscosity. The growth rates and threshold accelerations are independent of $\chi$, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. Nonlinear analyses of square and hexagonal patterns reveal that Fourier decomposition of wave-patterns can effectively decouple the intricate dynamics into axial modes, where the waves are weakly dependent on $\chi$, and oblique modes, where additional damping occurs in the shear surface viscous dominant interface. These results demonstrate that Faraday wave-patterns provide a route for identifying and quantifying the distinct roles of dilatational and shear surface viscosities.</description>

      <title>Toward Meshless Turbulent Flow Simulation: LES-Integrated Vortex Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in vortex particle methods for simulating three-dimensional incompressible flows are presented. A lightweight, dynamic Large-Eddy Simulation model is tested, featuring a dynamic procedure that relies solely on Lagrangian information and requires minimal auxiliary computation to update the model constant. The method employs a high-order algebraic kernel which enables direct, analytical expressions for conservation laws, the strain-rate tensor, and quadratic velocity diagnostics. Viscous diffusion is modeled using the core-spreading technique. The particle method is assessed with respect to kinematics and the conservation of energy, helicity, and enstrophy in vortex ring and leapfrogging vortex ring scenarios, both unperturbed and perturbed. The results indicate that the kinematics and flow diagnostics are accurately captured using relatively sparse particle distributions, effectively resolving the dynamics of the unstable flow phase. However, after the onset of instabilities, the sub-grid-scale methodology becomes strongly dependent on particle regularization to stabilize the flow solution.</description>

      <title>Identifying skin-friction generation structures in turbulent channel flows via canonical correlation decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow structures directly responsible for local skin-friction generation in turbulent channel flows are identified using the newly developed Canonical Correlation Decomposition (CCD) method. The dominant structures take the form of streamwise streaks that are spanwise-localised around the position where the skin-friction is targeted and exhibit significantly shorter streamwise extent than those revealed using POD. The resulting CCD spectrum shows a clear low-rank behaviour; flow reconstruction using only the first 4 CCD modes recovers more than 80\% of the examined skin friction, as opposed to 2\% recovered by the leading 4 POD modes. When the opposition control technique is used to reduce drag, the application of CCD shows that drag reduction is achieved by lifting the original streak structures and generating smaller streaks with opposite phases underneath. These findings demonstrate that CCD isolates the causally relevant flow structures governing skin-friction generation and modification, which is expected to find use in various drag control applications in wall-bounded turbulence.</description>

      <title>Multiscale geometric analysis of dynamic wettability on complex, fractal-like, anisotropic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces novel insights into the development of procedures for identifying the most relevant scales for observing the interactions of dynamic wettability and surface complexities. The experimental procedures presented for measuring dynamic contact angle hysteresis in multiscale correlation with the geometric characteristics of anisotropic surfaces contribute to a new perspective on measurement practice. In this study, microtexturing with a pyramidal structured abrasive belt is applied for precisely forming area- and length-scale fractal anisotropic surface complexities, and consequently, topographically dependent functional feature. The significant role of anisotropic topographies in modeling dynamic wettability behavior is highlighted through multiscale measurement-based analysis. These studies verify the relationship between dynamic wettability and the finest surface microgeometry (microroughness) and also the coarsest texture components (waviness). The size of topographic features, ranging from microroughness to waviness, significantly influences droplet pinning and liquid entrapment. Furthermore, the influence of material hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on the calculated multiscale relationships is assessed. The results indicated specific scales that best correlate with dynamic wettability, with length- and area-scale complexities of 6.9 um and 28 um2, respectively. A novel measurement-based approach to scale-dependent surface-functionality interactions offers new insights for designing dynamic wettability on anisotropic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a recent demonstration of stable trapping of floating particles by stationary (monochromatic) structured water waves [Nature 638, 394 (2025)], we report dynamic water-wave tweezers that enable controllable transport of trapped particles along arbitrary trajectories on the water surface. We employ a triangular lattice formed by the interference of three plane waves, which can trap particles, depending on parameters, either at intensity maxima or at intensity zeros (vortices). By introducing small frequency detunings between the interfering waves, we control 2D motion of the lattice and trapped particles. This approach is robust and effective over a relatively broad range of particle sizes and wave frequencies, offering remarkable new possibilities for noncontact manipulation of floating (e.g., biological and soft-matter) objects in fluidic environments.</description>

      <title>Effect of directionality on extreme wave formation during nonlinear shoaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that, in coastal waters where water depth decreases significantly due to rapid bathymetric changes, the non-equilibrium dynamics (NED) substantially increases the occurrence probability of extreme (rogue) waves. Nevertheless, research on depth-induced NED has been predominantly confined to unidirectional irregular waves, while the role of directionality remains largely unexplored. The scarce studies on multidirectional waves mainly rely on numerical simulations and have yielded conflicting results. In this work, we report on an experimental investigation of wave directionality on the depth-induced non-equilibrium wave statistics. High-order statistical moments, skewness and kurtosis, are used as proxies for the non-equilibrium wave response. Our results indicate that the directional spreading has a minor effect on decreasing the maximum values of these statistical moments. In contrast, the incidence direction plays a significant role in the non-equilibrium wave response, which is attributed to the effective bottom slope.</description>

      <title>Multi-pathline flow visualization using PIV images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the oldest flow visualization techniques is through multiple pathlines generated by the movement of seeding particles spatially distributed in the flow. In the computerized era, particle images are used in quantitative measurements, such as particle image and particle tracking velocimetry (PIV and PTV). Here, we present several methods for post-processing raw particle images to generate enhanced flow visualization without a need for conducting additional experiments. Three post-processing methods will be shown: 1) controlling the exposure time, 2) color-coding temporal information, and 3) changing the frame of reference. We showcase how employing these three methods can highlight different flow features in three canonical flow cases: vortex ring, leading edge vortex, and turbulent boundary layer. In addition to the quantitative flow field, the multi-pathline visualization is expected to augment our ability to observe fluid flow from many different perspectives.</description>

      <title>Landau damping of disturbances in nearly inviscid inflectional shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of damped two-dimensional perturbations in unstable plane-parallel shear flows with an inflection point. In inviscid flows within the stable wavenumber region $k$, no regular eigenmodes exist -- the frequency spectrum $\omega$ consists of a continuous set of singular van Kampen modes with real frequencies. Nevertheless, initial perturbations of the total vorticity integrated across the flow decay exponentially, resembling the behavior of an eigenmode with complex eigenfrequency ${\rm Im}\,\omega&lt;0$ (Landau damping). However, the vorticity itself does not decay but becomes increasingly corrugated across the flow. We demonstrate that accounting for arbitrarily small viscosity transforms this exponentially decaying perturbation into a true eigenmode in which the vorticity preserves its spatial form. We numerically trace the transformation of the vorticity structure of this mode and its disappearance as viscosity approaches zero. We discuss similarities and differences between the behavior of damped perturbations in the transition from inviscid to nearly inviscid flows in hydrodynamics and their behavior in plasma and homogeneous stellar systems during the analogous transition from collisionless to very weakly collisional systems.</description>

      <title>Energetic vs Inference-Based Invisibility: Fisher-Information Analysis of Two-Layer Acoustic Near-Cloaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-cloaks based on passive coatings can strongly suppress scattered-field energy in a narrow frequency band, yet an observer's ability to infer object parameters from noisy measurements need not decrease proportionally. We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reduced-Complexity Modeling of Fluid Flows: A Community Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a community challenge designed to facilitate direct comparisons between data-driven methods for compression, forecasting, and sensing of complex aerospace flows. The challenge is organized into three tracks that target these complementary capabilities: compression (compact representations for large datasets), forecasting (predicting future flow states from a finite history), and sensing (inferring unmeasured flow states from limited measurements). Across these tracks, multiple challenges span diverse flow datasets and use cases, each emphasizing different model requirements. The challenge is open to anyone, and we invite broad participation to build a comprehensive and balanced picture of what works and where current methods fall short. To support fair comparisons, we provide standardized success metrics, evaluation tools, and baseline implementations, with one classical and one machine-learning baseline per challenge. Final assessments use blind tests on withheld data. We explicitly encourage negative results and careful analyses of limitations. Outcomes will be disseminated through an AIAA Journal Virtual Collection and invited presentations at AIAA conferences.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the Vacuum Free Boundary Problem for the Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations With Large Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties.</description>

      <title>Hidden free energy released by explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the familiar two-stream instability is the result of spontaneous parity-time (PT)-symmetry breaking in a conservative system, and more importantly, explicit PT-symmetry breaking by viscosity can destabilize the system in certain parameter regimes that are stable when viscosity vanishes. This reveals that complex systems may possess hidden free energies protected by PT-symmetry and viscosity, albeit dissipative, can expose the systems to these freed energies by breaking PT-symmetry explicitly. Such a process is accompanied by instability and total variation growth.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Design of a Simple Three-Sphere Magnetic Microswimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>A radiation two-phase flow model for simulating plasma-liquid interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In laser-produced plasma (LPP) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources, deformation of a tin droplet into an optimal target shape is governed by its interaction with a pre-pulse laser-generated plasma. This interaction is mediated by a transient ablation pressure, whose complex spatio-temporal evolution remains experimentally inaccessible. Existing modeling approaches are limited: Empirical pressure-impulse models neglect dynamic plasma feedback, while advanced radiation-hydrodynamic codes often fail to resolve late-time droplet hydrodynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a radiation two-phase flow model based on a diffuse interface methodology. The model integrates radiation hydrodynamics for the plasma with the Euler equations for a weakly compressible liquid, extending a five-equation diffuse interface formulation to incorporate radiation transport, thermal conduction, and ionization. This formulation enforces pressure and velocity equilibrium across the diffuse interface region, with closure models constructed to ensure correct jump conditions at interfaces and asymptotically recover the pure-phase equations in bulk regions. Then, we apply the model to simulate a benchmark pre-pulse scenario, where a 50 micron tin droplet is irradiated by a 10 ns laser pulse. The simulations capture the rapid plasma expansion and subsequent inertial flattening of the droplet into a thin, curved sheet over microsecond timescales. Notably, the model reproduces experimentally observed features (such as an axial jet) rarely replicated in prior simulations. Quantitative agreement with experimental data for sheet dimensions and velocity validates the approach. The proposed model self-consistently couples laser-plasma physics with compressible droplet dynamics, providing a powerful tool for fundamental studies of plasma-liquid interactions in LPP-EUV source optimization.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed, boundary-constrained Gaussian process regression for the reconstruction of fluid flow fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression techniques have been used in fluid mechanics for the reconstruction of flow fields from a reduction-of-dimension perspective. A main ingredient in this setting is the construction of adapted covariance functions, or kernels, to obtain such estimates. In this paper, we present a general method for constraining a prescribed Gaussian process on an arbitrary compact set. The kernel of the pre-defined process must be at least continuous and may include other information about the studied phenomenon. This general boundary-constraining framework can be implemented with high flexibility for a broad range of engineering applications. From this, we derive physics-informed kernels for simulating two-dimensional velocity fields of an incompressible (divergence-free) flow around aerodynamic profiles. These kernels allow to define Gaussian process priors satisfying the incompressibility condition and the prescribed boundary conditions along the profile in a continuous manner. We describe an adapted numerical method for the boundary-constraining procedure parameterized by a measure on the compact set. The relevance of the methodology and performances are illustrated by numerical simulations of flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil profile, for which no observation at the boundary is needed at all.</description>

      <title>Capillary hysteresis induced by gap-resolved meniscus dynamics on Faraday instability in Hele-Shaw cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing theoretical analyses on Faraday instability in Hele-Shaw cells typically adopt gap-averaged governing equations and rely on Hamraoui's model coming from molecular kinetics theory, thereby oversimplifying essential transverse information, such as contact line velocity and capillary hysteresis, and conflicting with the unsteady meniscus dynamics. In this paper, a gap-resolved approach is developed by directly modeling the transverse gap flow and the contact angle dynamics, which overcomes the aforementioned limitations, ultimately yielding a modified damping with respect to the static contact angle and hysteresis range. A novel amplitude equation for linear Faraday instability is derived that combines this damping and the gap-averaged counterpart based on the oscillatory Stokes boundary layer, with the viscous dissipation preserved. By means of Lyapunov's first method, an explicit analytical expression for the critical stability boundary is established. Two series of laboratory experiments are performed that focus, respectively, on evolutions of the lateral meniscus and the longitudinal free surface near the Faraday onset, from which key parameters relevant to the theory are precisely measured. Based on the experimental data, the validity of the proposed mathematical model for addressing the Faraday instability problem in Hele-Shaw cells is confirmed, and the generation and development mechanisms of the onset are clarified. In the asymptotic analysis, the inclusion of contact angle dynamics increases the overall damping and thus partially compensates for the frequency detuning introduced by oscillatory Stokes flow approximation.</description>

      <title>Learning constitutive models and rheology from partial flow measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constitutive laws are at the core of fluid mechanics, relating the fluid stress to its deformation rate. Unlike Newtonian fluids, most industrial and biological fluids are non-Newtonian, exhibiting a nonlinear relation. Accurately characterizing this nonlinearity is essential for predicting flow behavior in real-world engineering and translational applications. Yet current methods fall short by relying on bulk rheometer data and simple fits that fail to capture behaviors relevant in complex geometries and flow conditions. Data-driven approaches can capture more complex behaviors, but lack interpretability or consistency. To close this gap, we leverage automatic differentiation to build an end-to-end framework for robust rheological learning. We develop a differentiable non-Newtonian fluid solver with a frame-invariant tensor basis neural network closure that learns stress directly from arbitrary flow measurements, such as velocimetry data. In parallel, we implement differentiable versions of major constitutive relations, enabling Bayesian model parametrization and selection from rheometer data. Our framework predicts flows in unseen geometries and ensures physical consistency and interpretability by matching neural network responses to known constitutive laws. Ultimately, this work lays the groundwork for advanced digital rheometry capable of comprehensively characterizing non-Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids under realistic in-situ or in-line operating conditions.</description>

Abstract: Pressure-driven flow collapses when confined ($u\propto r^{2}$). Asymmetry rectifies surface activity (exchange or slip gradients) into axial flux at $\Delta P=0$ despite zero net exchange. Lorentz reciprocity yields a projection law: throughput is the inner product of source with a geometry kernel. Signatures include inverted ``narrower-is-faster'' scaling ($u\propto r^{-1}$), leading-order viscosity independence, length amplification ($Q\propto L$), and linear superposition, defining surface-induced flow as a pressure-free Stokes-transport mode from microfluidics to physiology.</description>

      <title>Liouville Spectral Gap and Bifurcation Driven Lagrangian Eulerian Decoupling with Nondiffusive Turbulence Closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fully developed homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of motion, although formally equivalent, become statistically decoupled. In this work, by invoking Liouville theorem, we show that the joint probability density function (PDF) of the Eulerian and Lagrangian fields, evolving from arbitrary initial conditions, relaxes exponentially toward a factorized form given by the product of the corresponding marginal PDFs. This relaxation is governed by a genuine spectral gap of the Liouville operator, whose magnitude is primarily set by the bifurcation rate of the velocity gradient dynamics, whereas the contribution of Lyapunov exponents is shown to be significantly smaller. As a consequence, Eulerian Lagrangian correlations decay rapidly, and if the joint PDF is initially factorized, its factorized structure is preserved at all subsequent times, with each marginal evolving independently under the corresponding dynamics. We further show that the formal equivalence between the two descriptions implies the invariance of the relative kinetic energy between arbitrarily chosen points. When combined with the asymmetric statistics of instantaneous finite scale Lyapunov exponents in incompressible turbulence, this property provides a quantitative interpretation of particle pair separation and of the turbulent energy cascade.
  Finally, these results naturally lead to nondiffusive closure relations for the von K\'arm\'an Howarth and Corrsin equations, which coincide with those previously proposed by the author, thereby providing an independent theoretical validation of those closures.</description>

      <title>Hierarchic Flows to Estimate and Sample High-dimensional Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding low-dimensional interpretable models of complex physical fields such as turbulence remains an open question, 80 years after the pioneer work of Kolmogorov. Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\vvarphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. In a well chosen wavelet basis, conditional probabilities can be captured with low dimensional parametric models, because interactions between wavelet coefficients are local in space and scales. An outstanding issue is also to approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models of wavelet conditional probabilities with the scattering covariance. It is calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present resolvent4py, a parallel Python package for the analysis, model reduction and control of large-scale linear systems with millions or billions of degrees of freedom. This package provides the user with a friendly Python-like experience (akin to that of well-established libraries such as numpy and scipy), while enabling MPI-based parallelism through mpi4py, petsc4py and slepc4py. In turn, this allows for the development of streamlined and efficient Python code that can be used to solve several problems in fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, graph theory, molecular dynamics and several other fields.</description>
