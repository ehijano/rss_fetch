      <title>Physical Modelling of Piano Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive physical model and numerical implementation schemes for a grand piano, building upon the prior works of Chabassier et al. The model encompasses various subsystems, including hammer felt, hammer shank, string, soundboard, air and room barriers, each modelled in three dimensions to approach their realistic dynamics. A general framework for 3D elastic solids accounting for prestress and prestrain is introduced, particularly addressing the complexities of prestressed piano strings. The study also examines coupling between subsystem through mechanisms of surface force transmission and displacement/velocity continuity. To facilitate numerical simulations, strong PDEs are translated into weak ODEs via a flexible space discretization approach. Modal transformation of system ODEs is then employed to decouple and reduce DOFs, and an explicit time discretization scheme is customized for generating digital audio in the time domain. The study concludes with a discussion of the piano models capabilities, limitations, and potential future enhancements.</description>

      <title>A visual proof of entropy production during thermalization with a heat reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, the equilibrium curve of a thermodynamic system is used to depict entropy production in the process of thermalization with a reservoir. For the given initial and final equilibrium states of the system, the entropy production is reduced when work is also extracted during thermalization. The case of maximum work extraction corresponds to a reversible process. For less than optimal work extraction, the lost available work is shown to be directly proportional to the entropy produced.</description>

      <title>Geometrical description and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>
