      <title>Anytime Sorting Algorithms (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the anytime sorting problem, aiming to develop algorithms providing tentative estimates of the sorted list at each execution step. Comparisons are treated as steps, and the Spearman's footrule metric evaluates estimation accuracy. We propose a general approach for making any sorting algorithm anytime and introduce two new algorithms: multizip sort and Corsort. Simulations showcase the superior performance of both algorithms compared to existing methods. Multizip sort keeps a low global complexity, while Corsort produces intermediate estimates surpassing previous algorithms.</description>

      <title>Online busy time scheduling with flexible jobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several competitive ratios for the online busy time scheduling problem with flexible jobs. The busy time scheduling problem is a fundamental scheduling problem motivated by energy efficiency with the goal of minimizing the total time that machines with multiple processors are enabled. In the busy time scheduling problem, an unbounded number of machines is given, where each machine has $g$ processors. No more than $g$ jobs can be scheduled simultaneously on each machine. A machine consumes energy whenever at least one job is scheduled at any time on the machine. Scheduling a single job at some time $t$ consumes the same amount of energy as scheduling $g$ jobs at time $t$. In the online setting, jobs are revealed when they are released.
  We consider the cases where $g$ is unbounded and bounded. In this paper, we revisit the bounds of the unbounded general setting from the literature and tighten it significantly. We also consider agreeable jobs. For the bounded setting, we show a tightened upper bound. Furthermore, we show the first constant competitive ratio in the bounded setting that does not require lookahead.</description>

      <title>Explicit Orthogonal Arrays and Universal Hashing with Arbitrary Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal arrays are a type of combinatorial design that were developed in the 1940s in the design of statistical experiments. In 1947, Rao proved a lower bound on the size of any orthogonal array, and raised the problem of constructing arrays of minimum size. Kuperberg, Lovett and Peled (2017) gave a non-constructive existence proof of orthogonal arrays whose size is near-optimal (i.e., within a polynomial of Rao's lower bound), leaving open the question of an algorithmic construction. We give the first explicit, deterministic, algorithmic construction of orthogonal arrays achieving near-optimal size for all parameters. Our construction uses algebraic geometry codes.
  In pseudorandomness, the notions of $t$-independent generators or $t$-independent hash functions are equivalent to orthogonal arrays. Classical constructions of $t$-independent hash functions are known when the size of the codomain is a prime power, but very few constructions are known for an arbitrary codomain. Our construction yields algorithmically efficient $t$-independent hash functions for arbitrary domain and codomain.</description>

      <title>Faster algorithms for the alignment of sparse correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph ensemble is a probability law on pairs of graphs with $n$ vertices, parametrized by their average degree $\lambda$ and their correlation coefficient $s$. It can be used as a benchmark for the graph alignment problem, in which the labels of the vertices of one of the graphs are reshuffled by an unknown permutation; the goal is to infer this permutation and thus properly match the pairs of vertices in both graphs. A series of recent works has unveiled the role of Otter's constant $\alpha$ (that controls the exponential rate of growth of the number of unlabeled rooted trees as a function of their sizes) in this problem: for $s&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ and $\lambda$ large enough it is possible to recover in a time polynomial in $n$ a positive fraction of the hidden permutation. The exponent of this polynomial growth is however quite large and depends on the other parameters, which limits the range of applications of the algorithm. In this work we present a family of faster algorithms for this task, show through numerical simulations that their accuracy is only slightly reduced with respect to the original one, and conjecture that they undergo, in the large $\lambda$ limit, phase transitions at modified Otter's thresholds $\sqrt{\widehat{\alpha}}&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$, with $\widehat{\alpha}$ related to the enumeration of a restricted family of trees.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for the Steiner Arborescence Problem on a Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02830v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a phylogeny reconstruction problem in evolutionary biology, we study the minimum Steiner arborescence problem on directed hypercubes (MSA-DH). Given $m$, representing the directed hypercube $\vec{Q}_m$, and a set of terminals $R$, the problem asks to find a Steiner arborescence that spans $R$ with minimum cost. As $m$ implicitly represents $\vec{Q}_m$ comprising $2^{m}$ vertices, the running time analyses of traditional Steiner tree algorithms on general graphs does not give a clear understanding of the actual complexity of this problem. We present algorithms that exploit the structure of the hypercube and run in time polynomial in $|R|$ and $m$.
  We explore the MSA-DH problem on three natural parameters - $R$, and two above-guarantee parameters, number of Steiner nodes $p$ and penalty $q$. For above-guarantee parameters, the parameterized MSA-DH problem takes $p \geq 0$ or $q\geq 0$ as input, and outputs a Steiner arborescence with at most $|R| + p - 1$ or $m + q$ edges respectively. We present the following results ($\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides the polynomial factors):
  1. An exact algorithm that runs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(3^{|R|})$ time.
  2. A randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(9^q)$ time with success probability $\geq 4^{-q}$.
  3. An exact algorithm that runs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(36^q)$ time.
  4. A $(1+q)$-approximation algorithm that runs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1.25284^q)$ time.
  5. An $\mathcal{O}\left(p\ell_{\mathrm{max}} \right)$-additive approximation algorithm that runs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\ell_{\mathrm{max}}^{p+2})$ time, where $\ell_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum distance of any terminal from the root.</description>

      <title>Maximal Closed Substrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A string is closed if it has length 1 or has a nonempty border without internal occurrences. In this paper we introduce the definition of a \emph{maximal closed substring} (MCS), which is an occurrence of a closed substring that cannot be extended to the left nor to the right into a longer closed substring. MCSs with exponent at least $2$ are commonly called \emph{runs}; those with exponent smaller than $2$, instead, are particular cases of \emph{maximal gapped repeats}. We provide an algorithm that, given a string of length $n$ locates all MCSs the string contains in $\mathcal O(n\log n)$ time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shape Formation by 3D Hybrid Programmable Matter: An Algorithm for Low Diameter Intermediate Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the shape formation problem within the 3D hybrid model, where a single agent with a strictly limited viewing range and the computational capacity of a deterministic finite automaton manipulates passive tiles through pick-up, movement, and placement actions. The goal is to reconfigure a set of tiles into a specific shape termed an icicle. The icicle, identified as a dense, hole-free structure, is strategically chosen to function as an intermediate shape for more intricate shape formation tasks. It is designed for easy exploration by a finite state agent, enabling the identification of tiles that can be lifted without breaking connectivity. Compared to the line shape, the icicle presents distinct advantages, including a reduced diameter and the presence of multiple removable tiles. We propose an algorithm that transforms an arbitrary initially connected tile structure into an icicle in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ steps, matching the runtime of the line formation algorithm from prior work. Our theoretical contribution is accompanied by an extensive experimental analysis, indicating that our algorithm decreases the diameter of tile structures on average.</description>

      <title>ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</description>

      <title>A New Temporal Interpretation of Cluster Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete graph problem Cluster Editing seeks to transform a static graph into a disjoint union of cliques by making the fewest possible edits to the edges. We introduce a natural interpretation of this problem in temporal graphs, whose edge sets change over time. This problem is NP-complete even when restricted to temporal graphs whose underlying graph is a path, but we obtain two polynomial-time algorithms for restricted cases. In the static setting, it is well-known that a graph is a disjoint union of cliques if and only if it contains no induced copy of $P_3$; we demonstrate that no general characterisation involving sets of at most four vertices can exist in the temporal setting, but obtain a complete characterisation involving forbidden configurations on at most five vertices. This characterisation gives rise to an FPT algorithm parameterised simultaneously by the permitted number of modifications and the lifetime of the temporal graph.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for Fair Max-Min Diversification in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of extracting a diverse subset from a dataset, often referred to as maximum diversification, plays a pivotal role in various real-world applications that have far-reaching consequences. In this work, we delve into the realm of fairness-aware data subset selection, specifically focusing on the problem of selecting a diverse set of size $k$ from a large collection of $n$ data points (FairDiv).
  The FairDiv problem is well-studied in the data management and theory community. In this work, we develop the first constant approximation algorithm for FairDiv that runs in near-linear time using only linear space. In contrast, all previously known constant approximation algorithms run in super-linear time (with respect to $n$ or $k$) and use super-linear space. Our approach achieves this efficiency by employing a novel combination of the Multiplicative Weight Update method and advanced geometric data structures to implicitly and approximately solve a linear program. Furthermore, we improve the efficiency of our techniques by constructing a coreset. Using our coreset, we also propose the first efficient streaming algorithm for the FairDiv problem whose efficiency does not depend on the distribution of data points. Empirical evaluation on million-sized datasets demonstrates that our algorithm achieves the best diversity within a minute. All prior techniques are either highly inefficient or do not generate a good solution.</description>
