      <title>How to embed any likelihood into SBI: Application to Planck + Stage IV galaxy surveys and Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for simulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods cannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into combined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given by the Planck CMB likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an effective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously converged Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can subsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method, we combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a 3x2pt simulator (cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a Stage IV survey like Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parameterized by the $w_0w_a$ equation-of-state. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology hinted by DESI BAO DR2 + Planck 2018 + PantheonPlus SNIa datasets, we find that future 3x2pt data alone could detect evolving dark energy at $5\sigma$, while its combination with current CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets could raise the detection to almost $7\sigma$. Moreover, thanks to simulation reuse enabled by SBI, we show that our joint analysis is in excellent agreement with MCMC while requiring zero Boltzmann solver calls. This result opens up the possibility of performing massive global scans combining explicit and implicit likelihoods in a highly efficient way.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Foregrounds on Dark Ages Measurements with the Highly Redshifted 21 cm Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the cosmic dark ages ($30 \lesssim z \lesssim 150$) using the highly redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen offer unparalleled amounts of cosmological information, and recent years have seen the refinement of concepts for such experiments (e.g. CoDEX and FarView), nominally feasible with technology and resources in the next one to two decades. This work studies how the "foreground wedge" -- a term in the 21 cm cosmology literature referring to the contamination of power spectrum modes through the combination of smooth-spectrum foreground emission and the frequency-dependent point spread function of a radio interferometer -- manifests at these very high redshifts. We find the effect is more significant than at Epoch of Reionization redshifts targeted by current ground-based experiments, with foreground avoidance techniques (which discard all $k$ modes falling within the wedge) typically losing an order of magnitude of sensitivity. Given the extreme faintness of the 21 cm signal from the cosmic dark ages and the very high sky temperatures (the dominant source of noise) at low radio frequencies, we conclude that some level of foreground subtraction will be necessary to enable dark ages 21 cm cosmology with experiments of the scale believed to be achievable in the near term.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Impacts of Black Hole Mergers: No Relief in Sight for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The values of the Hubble constant inferred from local measurements and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) exhibit an approximately 5 sigma tension. Some have suggested this tension is alleviated if matter is converted to dark radiation via dark matter decay. As it is not clear that dark matter decays, we instead examine the effects of converting matter to gravitational radiation via black hole mergers. We consider mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the formation of SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that these processes cannot alleviate the tension, as an unrealistically large merger rate, or an overproduction of SMBHs is required. We also consider whether one can use the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect to constrain mechanisms that form SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that this is also too small to be viable.</description>

      <title>Imprints of gravitational-wave polarizations on projected tidal tensor in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) distort galaxy shapes through the tidal effect, offering a novel avenue to probe the nature of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how extra GW polarizations beyond those predicted by general relativity imprint observable signatures on galaxy shapes. Since galaxy shapes are measured as two-dimensional images projected onto the celestial sphere, we present three-dimensional statistical quantities of the projected tidal tensor sourced by the tensor perturbation. We show that the presence of extra polarization modes modifies both the amplitude and angular dependence of the correlation functions. Furthermore, we identify a distinct observational channel for probing parity violation in helicity-two and helicity-one modes. In particular, we show that if they propagate at different speeds, galaxy surveys can disentangle the source of parity violation. Our findings establish a theoretical framework for using upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys to test modified gravity theories through the polarization content of GWs.</description>

      <title>SPT-3G D1: Axion Early Dark Energy with CMB experiments and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most up-to-date constraints on axion early dark energy (AEDE) from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. In particular, we assess the impact of data from ground-based CMB experiments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) -- both with and without $Planck$ -- on constraints on AEDE. We also highlight the impact that BAO information from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has on these constraints. From CMB data alone, we do not find statistically significant evidence for the presence of AEDE, and we find only moderate reduction in the Hubble tension. From the latest SPT data alone, we find the maximal fractional contribution of AEDE to the cosmic energy budget is $f_{\rm EDE}\,&lt;\,0.12$ at $95\,$% confidence level (CL), and the Hubble tension between the SPT and SH0ES results is reduced to the $2.3\,\sigma$ level. When combining the latest SPT, ACT, and $Planck$ datasets, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,&lt;\,0.091$ at $95\,$% CL and the Hubble tension at the $3.3\, \sigma$ level. In contrast, adding DESI data to the CMB datasets results in mild preference for AEDE and, in some cases, non-negligible reduction in the Hubble tension. From SPT+DESI, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,0.081^{+0.037}_{-0.052}$ at $68\,$% CL, and the Hubble tension reduces to $1.5\,\sigma$. From the combination of DESI with all three CMB experiments, we get $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\, 0.071^{+0.035}_{-0.038}$ at $68\,$% CL and a weak preference for AEDE over $\Lambda$CDM. This data combination, in turn, reduces the Hubble tension to $2.3\, \sigma$. We highlight that this shift in parameters when adding the DESI dataset is a manifestation of the discrepancy currently present between DESI and CMB experiments in the concordance model $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Automated calibration of simulated galaxy catalogues for cosmological analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated galaxy catalogues have become an essential tool for preparing and exploiting observations from galaxy surveys. They constitute a key ingredient in modelling the systematic uncertainties present in the analysis. However, in order to reach the large volume and high precision required for galaxy surveys, we generally populate dark matter haloes with galaxies following certain theoretical recipes. Such recipes contain free parameters that are calibrated comparing the simulations against observations, but the creation of galaxy mocks is a stochastic process with a large number of free parameters to calibrate. We present a new pipeline, based on the differential evolution algorithm, that can calibrate galaxy mocks in a fully automated way for realistic scenarios with a large parameter space. We apply the pipeline to galaxy mocks built on a combination of halo occupation distribution and sub-halo abundance matching techniques. We show that our pipeline can properly calibrate the galaxy mocks against observations for both $\Lambda$CDM and modified gravity halo catalogues. This type of calibration pipeline provides a new tool for automating the calibration of future massive galaxy mocks.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Rays and Gravitational Waves from Inelastic Higgs Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a simple and predictive dark matter scenario involving a complex scalar field, $\phi$, coupled to the Higgs portal with no additional field content. In the UV, the field possesses a global $U(1)$ symmetry which is broken by mass terms and Higgs portal interactions. In the mass basis, the complex field splits into a pair of real scalars with a small mass splitting (in analogy to pseudo-Dirac fermions), such that the Higgs portal acquires both diagonal and off-diagonal terms with respect to these eigenstates. In the parameter space where the off-diagonal interaction predominates, this scenario is safe from direct detection constraints. Moreover, this model provides a viable explanation for the longstanding Galactic Center gamma-ray excess. Additionally, this model influences the Higgs potential in a way that could facilitate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition in the early universe, potentially leading to a stochastic gravitational wave background that could fall within the reach of upcoming space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Charged Loops at the Cosmological Collider with Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological collider physics allows the detection of heavy particles at inflationary scales through their imprints on primordial non-Gaussianities. We study the chemical potential mechanism applied to a pair of charged scalars. We analytically evaluate the resulting one-loop contribution to the bispectrum, using the spectral decomposition. In this way we are able to determine the parametric dependences for both the signal and the background. We show that a signal strength $f_{\mathrm{NL}}\sim O(0.01)$ can be obtained within theoretical control, potentially reachable by 21cm tomography. As an application we consider the colored Higgs bosons in $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ supersymmetric orbifold grand unification with masses $M\lesssim10^{15}\:\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>When First Beats Fast: Early Neutrino-Mass-Driven Flavor Instabilities in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small flux of antineutrinos with the opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

      <title>Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.</description>

      <title>Inflation models selected by the swampland distance conjecture with the Lyth bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.</description>

      <title>Consistent $N_{\rm eff}$ fitting in big bang nucleosynthesis analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, serves as a key fitting parameter extensively employed in cosmological studies. In this work, we point out a fundamental inconsistency in the conventional treatment of $N_{\rm eff}$ in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particularly regarding its applicability to new physics scenarios where $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, the deviation of $N_{\rm eff}$ from the standard BBN prediction, is negative. To ensure consistent interpretation, it is imperative to either restrict the allowed range of $N_{\rm eff}$ or systematically adjust neutrino-induced reaction rates based on physically motivated assumptions. As a concrete example, we consider a simple scenario in which a negative $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ arises from entropy injection into the electromagnetic sector due to the decay of long-lived particles after neutrino decoupling. This process dilutes the neutrino density and suppresses the rate of neutrino-driven neutron-proton conversion. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the resulting BBN constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ deviate significantly from those obtained by the conventional, but unphysical, extrapolation of dark radiation scenarios into the $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0$ regime.</description>

      <title>High-redshift Galaxies from JWST Observations in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \simeq 8$--$10$ reveals that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly improved agreement with observations even within standard $\Lambda$CDM, with statistical consistency within $1$--$2\sigma$ for moderate star formation efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges, particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate apparent tensions between JWST observations and $\Lambda$CDM predictions, highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics in early cosmic epochs.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, the background and perturbed cosmic dynamics have been investigated using an interacting dark-fluid model by assuming energy exchange between dark matter and dark energy through a diffusion mechanism. After we solve the background expansion history for the late-time Universe, the full set of linear perturbation equations is driven using the $1+3$-covariant approach. We take into account the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI BAO DR2), cosmic chronometers (CC), and the compilations SNIa distance moduli namely: Pantheon plus + SH0ES (PPS), DESY5, Union3, together with the redshift space distortion (RSD) and growth rate $f$ from VIPERS and SDSS collaborations for statistical analysis of the work. We then seek to constrain the best-fit cosmological parameters: $H_0$ in km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m$, $r_d$, $M$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$ and the interaction term $Q_m$ through the MCMC simulations. As a result, a comparison of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ values are made predicted by $\Lambda$CDM and diffusive models with the recent cosmological surveys. To evaluate the viability of the dark-fluid model in describing cosmic dynamics, the numerical results of background cosmological parameters are presented and the results show that the dark-fluid behaves like the Chaplygin gas (CG) that drives cosmic acceleration when $Q_m$ is negative, while for positive $Q_m$, it exhibits characteristics of a quintessence-like phase. From the perturbation evolution equations, the numerical results of density contrast, $\delta(z)$, growth rate, $f(z)$, and redshift space distortion, $f\sigma_8(z)$ are presented, demonstrate the impact of energy diffusion between dark matter and dark energy for the cosmic structure growth. Using the AIC and BIC Bayesian methods, a detailed statistical analysis has been performed.</description>

      <title>STAR NRE: Solving supernova selection effects with set-based truncated auto-regressive neural ratio estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accounting for selection effects in supernova type Ia (SN Ia) cosmology is crucial for unbiased cosmological parameter inference -- even more so for the next generation of large, mostly photometric-only surveys. The conventional "bias correction" procedure has a built-in systematic bias towards the fiducial model used to derive it and fails to account for the additional Eddington bias that arises in the presence of significant redshift uncertainty. On the other hand, likelihood-based analyses within a Bayesian hierarchical model, e.g. using MCMC, scale poorly with the data set size and require explicit assumptions for the selection function that may be inaccurate or contrived.
  To address these limitations, we introduce STAR NRE, a simulation-based approach that makes use of a conditioned deep set neural network and combines efficient high-dimensional global inference with subsampling-based truncation in order to scale to very large survey sizes while training on sets with varying cardinality. Applying it to a simplified SN Ia model consisting of standardised brightnesses and redshifts with Gaussian uncertainties and a selection procedure based on the expected LSST sensitivity, we demonstrate precise and unbiased inference of cosmological parameters and the redshift evolution of the volumetric SN Ia rate from ~100 000 mock SNae Ia. Our inference procedure can incorporate arbitrarily complex selection criteria, including transient classification, in the forward simulator and be applied to complex data like light curves. We outline these and other steps aimed at integrating STAR NRE into an end-to-end simulation-based pipeline for the analysis of future photometric-only SN Ia data.</description>

Abstract: Determining the spatial curvature ($\Omega_k$) independent of cosmic microwave background observations plays a key role in revealing the physics of the early universe. The Hubble tension is one of the most serious issues in modern cosmology. We investigate halo catalogs identified from $N$-body simulations at $z=2$ and 3, mimicking high-redshift galaxy surveys. We measure redshift-space correlation functions of halos from the two snapshots. We detect clear features of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions. We find that we can obtain a few percent constraints on both the geometric distances and growth of structure at the distant universe in future surveys. By taking into account the information of the underlying matter power spectrum, we demonstrate that we can also achieve constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ with a few percent as well as the spatial curvature with $|\Omega_k|\lesssim 0.1$ by observing galaxies with the number density with $\bar{n}_{\rm g}\simeq 10^{-4} (~h^3{\rm ~Mpc}^{-3})$. Our analysis provides a timely forecast for the upcoming spectroscopic surveys, which target emission line galaxy or dusty star-forming galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Turbulence: the Small-Scale Limit of the Cold-Dark-Matter Power Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, is one of the fundamental quantities in the study of large-scale structure in cosmology. Here, we study its small-scale asymptotic limit, and show that for cold dark matter in $d$ spatial dimensions, $P(k)$ has a universal $k^{-d}$ asymptotic scaling with the wave-number $k$, for $k \gg k_{\rm nl}$, where $k_{\rm nl}^{-1}$ denotes the length scale at which non-linearities in gravitational interactions become important. We propose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative analysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown to drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where the linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates the $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor turbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal interactions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a phase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is analysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this integral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness of the dark-matter distribution function - its non-vanishing only on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space - underpins both approaches. The theory is accompanied by $1\mathrm{D}$ Vlasov-Poisson simulations, which confirm it.</description>

      <title>Impact of Calibration and Position Errors on Astrophysical Parameters of the HI 21cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD) are pivotal stages during the first billion years of the universe, exerting a significant influence on the development of cosmic structure. The detection of the redshifted 21-cm signal from these epochs is challenging due to the dominance of significantly stronger astrophysical foregrounds and the presence systematics. This work used the 21cm E2E (end to end) pipeline, followed by simulation methodology described \cite{2022Mazumder} to conduct synthetic observations of a simulated sky model that includes both the redshifted 21-cm signal and foregrounds. A framework was constructed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian techniques to directly deduce astrophysical parameters from the measured power spectrum. This approach eliminates the need for explicit telescope layout effects correction in interferometric arrays such as SKA-Low. The present work investigates the impact of gain calibration and sky model position errors on the recovery of the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum for the SKA-Low AA$^{\ast}$ array configuration. We assessed the effects of these inaccuracies on the deduced astrophysical parameters and established acceptable tolerance levels. Based on our results, the gain calibration error tolerance for ideal signal detection is 0.001 \%. However, if the sky model position errors exceed 0.048 arcseconds, the remaining foregrounds would obscure the target signal.</description>

      <title>Estimating Bolometric Luminosities of Type 1 Quasars with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured, type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}. Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have also made our code publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries experience strong gravitational perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly affects the dynamics of their mergers. In this work, we develop a new formalism to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\Omega_{\rm gw} \propto \nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.</description>

Abstract: The existence of galaxies with no heavy elements is a key prediction of cosmological models. So far no "zero-metallicity", or Population III, galaxies have been identified. Here, we report the identification of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z = 5.725 ("AMORE6"), multiply imaged by a foreground galaxy cluster. JWST spectra consistently detect H$\beta$ at both positions, but [OIII]${\lambda}{\lambda}$4960,5008 remains undetected. This places a firm upper limit on its oxygen abundance, &lt; 0.12 % of solar metallicity at 2${\sigma}$, establishing itself as the most pristine object by far. AMORE6 exhibits exceptional properties that indicate the presence of pristine massive star formation. The finding of such an example at a relatively late cosmic time is surprising, but it also validates the basic ideas behind the Big Bang model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmologies, while offering a compelling alternative to inflationary models, face challenges from the growth of vector perturbations during the contracting phase. While linear vector instabilities can be avoided with specific initial conditions or the absence of vector degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the significant role of secondary vector perturbations generated by nonlinear interactions with scalar fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that in a broad class of single-field matter-bounce scenarios, these secondary vector perturbations get unacceptably large amplitudes, provided the curvature fluctuations are consistent with cosmic microwave background observations. This finding underscores the crucial importance of scalar-induced vector perturbations in bouncing cosmology and highlights the need for further investigation into their potential impact on the viability of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inspiral of a high mass-ratio black hole binary located in the nucleus of a galaxy, where the primary central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter spike formed through accretion during the black hole growth phase. Within this spike, dark matter undergoes strong self-annihilation, producing a compact source of $\gamma$-ray radiation that is highly sensitive to spike density, while the binary emits gravitational waves at frequencies detectable by LISA. As the inspiralling binary interacts with the surrounding dark matter particles, it alters the density of the spike, thereby influencing the $\gamma$-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. We demonstrate that the spike self-annihilation luminosity decreases by $10\%$ to $90\%$ of its initial value, depending on the initial density profile and binary mass ratio, as the binary sweeps through the LISA band. This presents a new opportunity to indirectly probe dark matter through multi-messenger observations of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional supersymmetric QCD in conformal window with a marginally relevant deformation which triggers the spontaneous breaking of (approximate) scale invariance and the subsequent confinement, generating a mass gap, at an energy scale hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale without fine-tuning. We analyze the finite temperature system and show that the phase transition associated with the breaking of conformal invariance is of the strong first order. When such a phase transition takes place at a temperature of the Universe around the electroweak scale, it generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background probed by future space-based interferometers, while a conformal phase transition in a dark sector at $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV generates GWs to explain the reported pulsar timing array signal.</description>

      <title>Model Agnostic $F(R)$ Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</description>

Abstract: We provide an updated test for modifications of gravity from a sample of wide-binary stars from Gaia DR3, and their sky-projected relative velocities. Here we extend on our earlier 2023 study, using several updated selection cuts aimed at reducing contamination from triple systems with an undetected third star. We also use improved mass estimates from Gaia FLAME, and we add refinements to previous modelling of the triple and other populations and the model-fitting. We fit histograms of observed vs Newtonian velocity differences to a flexible mixture of binary + triple populations with realistic eccentricity distributions, plus unbound flyby and random-chance populations. We find as before that Newtonian models provide a significantly better fit than MOND, though improved understanding of the triple population is necessary to make this fully decisive.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <title>GW170817 Viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation Compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate several Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models that are compatible with the GW170817 event, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the BICEP/Keck updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider two distinct classes of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories, which are equally successful for GW170817-compatible model building and we examine their viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The two models are distinct since the first class relates directly the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function with the scalar potential and yields $c_T^2=1$ while in the second class, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function and the scalar potential are freely but conveniently chosen and the class of models respects the constraint $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| &lt; 6 \times 10^{-15}$. We provide several examples of models belonging to both the two classes of GW170817-compatible Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories and we demonstrate that Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories provide a promising theoretical framework for inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>First release of LiteBIRD simulations from an end-to-end pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07122</link>

Abstract: The LiteBIRD satellite mission aims at detecting Cosmic Microwave Background $B$ modes with unprecedented precision, targeting a total error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of $\delta r \sim 0.001$. Operating from the L2 Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, LiteBIRD will survey the full sky across 15 frequency bands (34 to 448 GHz) for 3 years.The current LiteBIRD baseline configuration employs 4508 detectors sampling at 19.1 Hz to achieve an effective polarization sensitivity of $ 2 \mu\mathrm{K-arcmin}$ and an angular resolution of 31 arcmin (at 140 GHz).We describe the first release of the official LiteBIRD simulations, realized with a new simulation pipeline developed using the LiteBIRD Simulation Framework, see https://github.com/litebird/litebird_sim . This pipeline generates 500 full-sky simulated maps at a Healpix resolution of nside=512. The simulations include also one year of Time Ordered Data for approximately one-third of LiteBIRD's total detectors.</description>

      <title>Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t&lt;100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\'en speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfv\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.</description>
