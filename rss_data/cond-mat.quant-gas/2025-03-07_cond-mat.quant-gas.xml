      <title>Constrained many-body phases in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Higgs lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to soft-core bosonic matter at unit filling, inspired by the Higgs sector of the standard model. Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.</description>

      <title>The Bose polaron as thermometer of a trapped Bose gas: a quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum impurities interacting with quantum environments offer unique insights into many-body systems. Here, we explore the thermometric potential of a neutral impurity immersed in a harmonically trapped bosonic quantum gas below the Bose-Einstein condensation critical temperature $T_c$. Using ab-initio Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperatures, we analyze the impurity's sensitivity to temperature changes by exploiting experimentally accessible observables such as its spatial distribution. Our results, covering a temperature range of $-1.1 \leqslant T/T_c \leqslant 0.9$, reveal that the impurity outperforms estimations based on a one-species bath at lower temperatures, achieving relative precision of 3-4\% for 1000 measurement repetitions. While non-zero boson-impurity interaction strength $g_{BI}$ slightly reduces the accuracy, the impurity's performance remains robust, especially in the low-temperature regime $T/T_c \lesssim 0.45$ withing the analyzed interaction strengths $0 \leqslant g_{BI}/g \leqslant 5$, where $g$ is the boson-boson coupling. We confirm that quantum optical models can capture rather well the dependence of the temperature sensor on the impurity-gas interaction. Although our findings are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, our Monte Carlo simulations offer improved precision. We find that the maximum likelihood estimation protocol approaches the precision comparable to the limit set by the Quantum Fisher Information bound. Finally, using the Hellinger distance method, we directly extract the Fisher information and find that, by exploiting the extremum order statistics, impurities far from the trap center are more sensitive to thermal effects than those close to the trap center.</description>

      <title>Origin and emergent features of many-body dynamical localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether interactions can break dynamical localization in quantum kicked rotor systems has been the subject of a long-standing debate. Here, we introduce an extended mapping from the kicked Lieb-Liniger model to an effective lattice model with long-range couplings and reveal two universal features: on-site pseudorandomness and rapidly decaying couplings in the center-of-mass momentum. For finite contact interactions, the long-range coupling between relative momenta obeys an algebraic decay behavior with a crossover of its decay exponent as the interaction increases. Similar behavior occurs in the Fock basis, underscoring the robustness and distinct many-body characteristics of dynamical localization. Analysis of the generalized fractal dimension and level-spacing ratio also supports these findings, highlighting the presence of near integrability and multifractality in different regions of parameter space. Our results offer an explanation for the occurrence of many-body dynamical localization, particularly in strongly correlated quantum gases, and are anticipated to generalize to systems of many particles.</description>

      <title>Restoring thermalization in long-range quantum magnets with staggered magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems with strong long-range interactions are thought to resist thermalization because of their discrete energy spectra. We show that applying a staggered magnetic field to a strong long-range Heisenberg antiferromagnet restores thermalization for a large class of initial states by breaking permutational symmetry. Using self-consistent mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we reveal that the energy spectrum, while composed of discrete subspaces, collectively forms a dense spectrum. The equilibration time is independent of system size and depends only on the fluctuations in the initial state. For initial states at low to intermediate energies, the long-time average aligns with the microcanonical ensemble. However, for states in the middle of the spectrum the long-time average depends on the initial state due to quantum scar-like eigenstates localized at unstable points in classical phase space. Our results can be readily tested on a range of experimental platforms, including Rydberg atoms or optical cavities.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a dark matter particle.</description>

      <title>Principal component analysis for 5/2 fractional quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the special single-layer fractional quantum Hall system with a filling factor of 5/2, which has an even denominator, this paper uses principal component analysis (PCA) to study its behavior under the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. By introducing a model three-body potential to represent the mechanism of particle-hole symmetry breaking, the paper finds that the 5/2 system evolves into two types of special topological quantum states with non-Abelian statistics as the strength and direction of the three-body potential vary. The transition points of these states correspond to the particle-hole symmetric pure Coulomb interaction system. Our results validate the applicability of machine learning as a new research tool in fractional quantum Hall systems. Furthermore, machine learning directly analyzes the raw wave functions, without relying on prior empirical theoretical assumptions and models, making it applicable to a broader range of fractional quantum Hall systems experiencing phase transitions due to particle-hole symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of distinct mobility edges in a 1D quasiperiodic mosaic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional quasiperiodic mosaic model with analytically solvable mobility edges that exhibit different phase transitions depending on the system parameters. Specifically, by combining mosaic quasiperiodic next-nearest-neighbor hoppings and quasiperiodic on-site potentials, we rigorously demonstrate the existence of two distinct types of mobility edges: those separating extended and critical states, and those separating extended and localized states. Using Avila's global theory, we derive exact analytical expressions for these mobility edges and determine the parameter regimes where each type dominates. Our numerical calculations confirm these analytical results through fractal dimension analysis. Furthermore, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to realize this model using Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with engineered momentum-state transitions. We also investigate the effects of many-body interactions under mean-field approximation. Our work provides a fertile ground for studying the coexistence of different types of mobility edges in quasiperiodic systems and suggests a feasible experimental platform to observe and control these transitions.</description>

      <title>Geometrical frustration, power law tunneling and non-local gauge fields from scattered light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing the amplitude and range of couplings in quantum systems is a fundamental tool for exploring a large variety of quantum mechanical effects. Here, we consider off-resonant photon scattering processes on a geometrically shaped molecular cloud. Our analysis shows that such a setup is properly modeled by a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian where the range, amplitude and sign of the tunneling processes of the scattered photonic modes can be accurately tuned. Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.</description>
