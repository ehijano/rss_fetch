      <title>A Characteristic Signature of Magnetospheric Wave-Particle Interactions Found in the Turbulent E-region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate deep into Earth's atmosphere, where they impart their temporal characteristics to diffuse aurorae. Using radar-observations of the ionospheric E-region and satellite observations from the magnetosphere, we demonstrate a close and unprecedented association between enhanced electrostatic cyclotron harmonic wave activity in the magnetosphere and the appearance of meter-scale ionospheric plasma turbulence observed a few seconds later in the lower ionosphere on nearby magnetic field lines.</description>

      <title>Chondrule dust rim growth: Influence of restructuring using molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of disruptive collisions on chondrule rim growth, emphasizing the role of kinetic energy in determining the outcomes of these interactions. We establish a threshold of approximately 10 cm/s for the "hit-and-stick" collision regime, beyond which significant changes occur in the structure of rimmed chondrules. Our findings highlight that at low collision energies (KE $&lt; 10^{-12}$ J), minimal structural alteration takes place, while higher energies (KE up to $10^{-10}$ J) lead to compaction of the rim, reducing both its thickness and porosity. Collisions with energies exceeding $10^{-8}$ J result in the complete disruption of the rim, with particles being expelled from it. These results are correlated with the turbulence levels within the disk, as kinetic energy scales with the relative velocities of colliding particles. Leveraging machine learning models trained on our collision data, we predict changes in rim characteristics and employ these predictions in a Monte Carlo simulation to explore rim growth dynamics. Our simulations reveal that rim development is sustained in low-turbulence environments ($\alpha \leq 10^{-5}$), while intermediate turbulence levels ($\alpha$ = $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) lead to erosion, preventing further rim accumulation in high-turbulence contexts.</description>

      <title>A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Effect in Earth's Dayside Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field strength, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations (correlation coefficient = 0.78). During geospace storms, then, turbulent structuring as well as fast electrodynamics in the dayside polar ionosphere can be driven by wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>SIP-IFVM: Efficient time-accurate magnetohydrodynamic model of the corona and coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient and time-accurate three-dimensional (3D) single-fluid MHD solar coronal model and employ it to simulate CME evolution and propagation. Based on a quasi-steady-state implicit MHD coronal model, we developed an efficient time-accurate coronal model that can be used to speed up the CME simulation by selecting a large time-step size. We have called it the Solar Interplanetary Phenomena-Implicit Finite Volume Method (SIP-IFVM) coronal model. A pseudo-time marching method was implemented to improve temporal accuracy. A regularised Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL) flux rope, whose axis can be designed into an arbitrary shape, was inserted into the background corona to trigger the CME event. We performed a CME simulation on the background corona of Carrington rotation (CR) 2219 and evaluated the impact of time-step sizes on simulation results. Our study demonstrates that this model is able to simulate the CME evolution and propagation process from the solar surface to $20\; R_s$ in less than 0.5 hours (192 CPU cores, $\sim$ 1 M cells). Compared to the explicit counterpart, this implicit coronal model is not only faster, but it also has improved numerical stability. We also conducted an ad hoc simulation with initial magnetic fields artificially increased. It shows that this model can effectively deal with time-dependent low-$\beta$ problems ($\beta&lt;10^{-4}$). Additionally, an Orszag-Tang MHD vortex flow simulation demonstrates that the pseudo-time-marching method used in this coronal model can simulate small-scale unsteady-state flows. The simulation results show that this MHD coronal model is very efficient and numerically stable. It is a promising approach to simulating time-varying events in the solar corona with low plasma $\beta$ in a timely and accurate manner.</description>
