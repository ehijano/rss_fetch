      <title>Theoretical analysis on the origin of the double-well band dispersion in the CuO double chains of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ and its impact on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ is a unique member of cuprate superconductors where many studies suggest that CuO double chains are responsible for superconductivity. One characteristic and non-trivial feature of its electronic structure is a relatively large electron hopping $t$ between nearest neighbor Cu sites with a Cu-O-Cu angle of around 90 degrees. In this study, we have theoretically pinned down the origin of a large $|t|$ in the double-chain structure of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ using first-principles calculation and tight-binding-model analysis. We have found that, in the nearest neighbor hopping $t$, $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$-$p$-$d$ contributions roughly cancel each other out and the $d$-$p$-$d$ hopping path enhanced by the local distortion of the double chain is a key to get the large $|t|$. Double-well band dispersion arising from the relatively large $|t/t'|$ allows the enhancement of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity by the incipient-band mechanism, where the one band bottom plays a role of the incipient valley. Our study provides the important knowledge to understand the unique superconductivity in Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopic Study on Bi2Rh3Se2: Two-dimensional-Ising Charge Density Wave and Quantum Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ternary chalcogenide Bi2Rh3Se2 was found to be a charge density wave (CDW) superconductor with a 2*2 periodicity. The key questions regarding the underlying mechanism of CDW state and its interplay with lattice and electronic properties remains to be explored. Here, based on the systematic Raman scattering investigations on single crystalline Bi2Rh3Se2, we observed the fingerprinting feature of CDW state, a collective amplitude mode at 39 cm-1. The temperature evolution of Raman shift and line width for this amplitude mode can be well described by the critical behavior of two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, suggesting the interlayer interactions of Bi2Rh3Se2 is negligible when CDW state is formed, as a consequence, the quantum fluctuations play an important role at low temperature. Moreover, temperature dependence of Raman shift for Ag9 mode deviates significantly from the expected anharmonic behavior when approaching the CDW transition temperature 240 K, demonstrated that strong electron-phonon coupling plays a key role in the formation of CDW. Our results reveal that Bi2Rh3Se2 is an intriguing quasi-2D system to explore electronic quantum phase transition and modulate the correlations between CDW and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase interference effect in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pairing symmetry of superconducting electrons can be identified through various phase-sensitive experiments. However, phenomena like the Josephson effect predominantly depend on frameworks exhibiting macroscopic interference. At the microscopic level, phase interference effects within momentum space are absent due to the intrinsic challenge of extracting phase information from specific momentum points. By incorporating the hybridization effect between a primary band and its replica bands generated by density wave orders or other interactions, we introduce a superconducting phase interference effect at the intersection points on the Fermi surfaces of these two bands. This effect clarifies the extraordinary behavior observed in the single-particle spectral function in recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in the $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212) superconductor. It also offers a new insight into the non-zero Josephson current observed in a $45^\circ$-twisted Josephson junction of cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Studying Critical Parameters of Superconductor via Diamond Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical parameters are the key to superconductivity research, and reliable instrumentations can facilitate the study. Traditionally, one has to use several different measurement techniques to measure critical parameters separately. In this work, we develop the use of a single species of quantum sensor to determine and estimate several critical parameters with the help of independent simulation data. We utilize the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in the diamond, which recently emerged as a promising candidate for probing exotic features in condensed matter physics. The non-invasive and highly stable nature provides extraordinary opportunities to solve scientific problems in various systems. Using a high-quality single-crystalline YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{4}$O$_{8}$ (YBCO) as a platform, we demonstrate the use of diamond particles and a bulk diamond to probe the Meissner effect. The evolution of the vector magnetic field, the $H-T$ phase diagram, and the map of fluorescence contour are studied via NV sensing. Our results reveal different critical parameters, including lower critical field $H_{c1}$, upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and critical current density $j_{c}$, as well as verifying the unconventional nature of this high-temperature superconductor YBCO. Therefore, NV-based quantum sensing techniques have huge potential in condensed matter research.</description>

      <title>Unveiling van Hove singularity modulation and fluctuated charge order in kagome superconductor $\rm{CsV_3Sb_5}$ via time-resolved ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, which exhibits intertwined unconventional charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, has garnered significant attention recently. Despite extensive static studies, the nature of these exotic electronic orders remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the non-equilibrium electronic structure of CsV3Sb5 via time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results reveal that upon laser excitation, the van Hove singularities immediately shift towards the Fermi level and subsequently oscillate in sync with a 1.3 THz coherent phonon mode. By analyzing the coherent intensity oscillations in the energy-momentum (E-k) map, we find that this coherent phonon is strongly coupled with electronic bands from both Sb and V orbitals. While typically observable only in the CDW state, remarkably, we find that the 1.3-THz coherent phonon mode can be persistently excited at temperatures above T_CDW, suggesting the potential existence of fluctuated CDW in CsV3Sb5. These findings enhance our understanding of the unconventional CDW control of kagome superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Searching for new heavy fermions with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models were developed and implemented to aid the search for new heavy fermion compounds. For the purpose of these calculations a database of more than 200 heavy fermions was compiled from the literature. The deep learning networks trained on the database were then used for regression calculations, and predictions were made about the coherence temperature, Sommerfeld coefficient and carrier effective mass of potential new heavy fermions. Classification calculations were also performed in order to check whether predicted heavy fermions are superconducting and/or antiferromagnetic. Chemical composition was the only physical predictor used during the learning process. Suggestions were made for future improvements in terms of expanding the database, as well as for other artificial intelligence calculations.</description>

      <title>Perspective on the Vortex Mass Determination in Superconductors using Circular Dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective mass of Abrikosov vortices in superconductors remains a challenging problem with limited experimental verification. In this paper, we present a method based on observation of the vortex mass in magnetic circular dichroism at terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate the emergence of dichroism with decreasing temperature in two YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films of different doping. The experimental results can be explained within a theoretical model that takes into account the vortex mass and provides an expression for the optical complex conductivity. We discuss the model parameters and show how they are obtained from the supporting experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticles-mediated thermal diode effect in Weyl Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically show quasiparticles-driven thermal diode effect (TDE) in an inversion symmetry-broken (ISB) Weyl superconductor (WSC)-Weyl semimetal (WSM)-WSC Josephson junction. A Zeeman field perpendicular to the WSM region of the thermally-biased Weyl Josephson junction (WJJ) induces an asymmetry between the forward and reverse thermal currents, which is responsible for the TDE. Most interestingly, we show that the sign and magnitude of the thermal diode rectification coefficient is highly tunable by the superconducting phase difference and external Zeeman field, and also strongly depends on the junction length. The tunability of the rectification, particularly, the sign changing behavior associated with higher rectification enhances the potential of our WJJ thermal diode to use as functional switching components in thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Designing Quaternary Hydrides with Potential High T$_c$ Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While hydrogen-rich materials have been demonstrated to exhibit high T$_c$ superconductivity at high pressures, there is an ongoing search for ternary and quaternary hydrides that achieve such high critical temperatures at much lower pressures. First-principles searches are impeded by the computational complexity of solving the Eliashberg equations for large, complex crystal structures. Here, we adopt a simplified approach using electronic indicators previously established to be correlated with superconductivity in hydrides. This is used to study complex hydride structures, which are predicted to exhibit promisingly high critical temperatures for superconductivity. In particular, we propose three classes of hydrides inspired by the FCC RH$_3$ structures that exhibit strong hydrogen network connectivity, as defined through the electron localization function. The first class [RH$_{11}$X$_3$Y] is based on a Pm$\overline{3}$m structure showing moderately high T$_c$, where the T$_c$ estimate from electronic properties is compared with direct Eliashberg calculations and found to be surprisingly accurate. The second class of structures [(RH$_{11}$)$_2$X$_6$YZ] improves on this with promisingly high density of states with dominant hydrogen character at the Fermi energy, typically enhancing T$_c$. The third class [(R$^1$H$_{11}$)(R$^2$H$_{11}$)X$_6$YZ] improves the strong hydrogen network connectivity by introducing anisotropy in the hydrogen network through a specific doping pattern. These model structures and the design principles provide the enough flexibility to optimize both T$_c$ and the structural stability of complex hydrides.</description>

      <title>Conventional Superconductivity in the Doped Kagome Superconductor Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5 from Vortex Lattice Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hallmark of unconventional superconductors is their complex electronic phase diagrams where "intertwined orders" of charge-spin-lattice degrees of freedom compete and coexist as in copper oxides and iron pnictides. While the electronic phase diagram of kagome lattice superconductor such as CsV3Sb5 also exhibits complex behavior involving coexisting and competing charge density wave order and superconductivity, much is unclear about the microscopic origin of superconductivity. Here, we study the vortex lattice (VL) in superconducting state of Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5, where the Ta-doping suppresses charge order and enhances superconductivity. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a strictly bulk probe, we show that the VL exhibits a strikingly conventional behavior. This includes a triangular VL with a period consistent with 2e-pairing, a field dependent scattering intensity that follows a London model, and a temperature dependence consistent with a uniform superconducting gap expected for s-wave pairing. These results suggest that optimal bulk superconductivity in Cs(V1-xTax)3Sb5 arises from a conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer electron-lattice coupling, different from spin fluctuation mediated unconventional copper and iron based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition in polycrystalline YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ samples during the oxidation process at constant temperature via thermogravimetry and differential thermometry analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the oxygenation process of polycrystalline powder of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ superconductor material through constant temperature thermogravimetric analysis. Starting from completely deoxygenated samples ($\delta$ = 0), both the mass evolution in an oxygen atmosphere and a differential temperature value referenced to an inert sample (alumina powder) subjected to the same experimental conditions are recorded. The oxygenation process itself is identified as an exothermic process accompanied by a second also exothermic associated process. This second process is identified as the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition present in the material. Based on the obtained results, the structural phase diagram of the material is reconstructed. Issues of metastability of the structural phases, as well as the potential of the equipment used to obtain these results comparable to those obtained in large facilities, are discussed. Reinterpretations of previously discussed works in the literature are inferred.</description>

      <title>Optimizing one dimensional superconducting diodes: Interplay of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the non-reciprocal nature of the critical current (maximum current that a superconductor can withstand before turning into a normal metal) of a superconducting device. Here, we investigate SDE in helical superconductors with broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, focusing on a prototypical Rashba nanowire device proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subjected to external magnetic fields. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field formalism, we analyze the interplay between linear and higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC), bulk supercurrents, and external magnetic fields. Our results demonstrate that Rashba nanowires with only linear SOC can achieve incredibly large diode efficiencies &gt; 45% through the interplay of longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. Notably, higher-order SOC introduces qualitatively different behavior, enabling finite diode efficiency even in the absence of a longitudinal Zeeman field due to inherent energy dispersion asymmetry. We present a comprehensive phase diagram of the device elucidating the emergent Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state and demonstrate that proximitized Rashba nanowires offer a versatile, practical platform for SDE, with potential realizations in existing material systems. These results provide crucial insights for optimizing SDE in nanoscale superconducting devices, paving the way for next-generation dissipationless quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Towards heavy-mass ab initio nuclear structure: Open-shell Ca, Ni and Sn isotopes from Bogoliubov coupled-cluster theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in nuclear many-body theory enabled the description of open-shell medium-mass nuclei from first principles by exploiting the spontaneous breaking of symmetries within correlation expansion methods. Once combined with systematically improvable inter-nucleon interactions consistently derived from chiral effective field theory, modern ab initio nuclear structure calculations provide a powerful framework to deliver first-principle predictions accompanied with theoretical uncertainties. In this Letter, controlled ab initio Bogoliubov coupled cluster (BCC) calculations are performed for the first time, targeting the ground-state of all calcium, nickel and tin isotopes up to mass A ~ 180. While showing good agreement with available experimental data, the shell structure evolution in neutron-rich isotopes and the location of the neutron drip-lines are predicted. The BCC approach constitutes a key development towards reliable first-principles simulations of heavy-mass open-shell nuclei.</description>

      <title>Readout error mitigated quantum state tomography tested on superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies rely heavily on accurate control and reliable readout of quantum systems. Current experiments are limited by numerous sources of noise that can only be partially captured by simple analytical models and additional characterization of the noise sources is required. We test the ability of readout error mitigation to correct realistic noise found in systems composed of quantum two-level objects (qubits). To probe the limit of such methods, we designed a beyond-classical readout error mitigation protocol based on quantum state tomography (QST), which estimates the density matrix of a quantum system, and quantum detector tomography (QDT), which characterizes the measurement procedure. By treating readout error mitigation in the context of state tomography the method becomes largely readout mode-, architecture-, noise source-, and quantum state-independent. We implement this method on a superconducting qubit and evaluate the increase in reconstruction fidelity for QST. We characterize the performance of the method by varying important noise sources, such as suboptimal readout signal amplification, insufficient resonator photon population, off-resonant qubit drive, and effectively shortened $T_1$ and $T_2$ decay times. As a result, we identified noise sources for which readout error mitigation worked well, and observed decreases in readout infidelity by a factor of up to 30.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the classical dynamics influence the localization behaviour of Majorana wavefunctions in Majorana billiards. By using a connection between Majorana wavefunctions and eigenfunctions of a normal state Hamiltonian, we show that Majorana wavefunctions in both p-wave and s-wave topological superconductors inherit the properties of the underlying normal state eigenfunctions. As an example, we demonstrate that Majorana wavefunctions in topological superconductors with chaotic shapes feature quantum scarring. Furthermore, we show a way to manipulate a localized Majorana wavefunction by altering the underlying classical dynamics using a local potential away from the localization region. Finally, in the presence of chiral symmetry breaking, we find that the Majorana wavefunction in convex-shaped Majorana billiards exhibits caustics formation, reminiscent of a normal state system with magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signatures of Topological Superconductivity in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically-trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the ``half-slope'' feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.</description>
