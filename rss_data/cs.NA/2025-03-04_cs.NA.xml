      <title>Multigrid Preconditioning for FD-DLM Method in Elliptic Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of multigrid preconditioners for solving linear systems arising from finite element discretizations of elliptic interface problems using the Fictitious Domain with Distributed Lagrange Multipliers (FD-DLM) formulation. Numerical experiments are conducted using continuous and discontinuous finite element spaces for the Lagrange multiplier. Results indicate that multigrid is a promising preconditioner for problems in the FD-DLM formulation.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Ghost Penalty Evaluation via Tensor Product Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a matrix-free approach for implementing ghost penalty stabilization in Cut Finite Element Methods
  (CutFEM). By exploiting the tensor-product structure of the ghost penalty operator, we reduce its evaluation to a
  series of one-dimensional matrix-vector products using precomputed 1D matrices, avoiding the need to evaluate
  high-order derivatives directly. This approach achieves $O(k^{d+1})$ complexity for elements of degree $k$ in $d$
  dimensions, significantly reducing implementation effort while maintaining accuracy. The method is implemented
  within the \texttt{deal.II}
  library.</description>

      <title>Mass conservation, positivity and energy identical-relation preserving scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations with variable density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a mass conservation, positivity and energy identical-relation preserving scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations with variable density. Utilizing the square transformation, we first ensure the positivity of the numerical fluid density, which is form-invariant and regardless of the discrete scheme. Then, by proposing a new recovery technique to eliminate the numerical dissipation of the energy and to balance the loss of the mass when approximating the reformation form, we preserve the original energy identical-relation and mass conservation of the proposed scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can preserve the original energy identical-relation for the Navier-Stokes equations with variable density. Moreover, the error estimates of the considered scheme are derived. Finally, we show some numerical examples to verify the correctness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A nodally bound-preserving finite element method for time-dependent convection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method to approximate the time-dependent convection-diffusion equations using conforming finite element methods, ensuring that the discrete solution respects the physical bounds imposed by the differential equation. The method is built by defining, at each time step, a convex set of admissible finite element functions (that is, the ones that satisfy the global bounds at their degrees of freedom) and seeks for a discrete solution in this admissible set. A family of $\theta$-schemes is used as time integrators, and well-posedness of the discrete schemes is proven for the whole family, but stability and optimal-order error estimates are proven for the implicit Euler scheme. Nevertheless, our numerical experiments show that the method also provides stable and optimally-convergent solutions when the Crank-Nicolson method is used.</description>

      <title>Iterative Direct Sampling Method for Elliptic Inverse Problems with Limited Cauchy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative iterative direct sampling method to solve nonlinear elliptic inverse problems from a limited number of pairs of Cauchy data. It extends the original direct sampling method (DSM) by incorporating an iterative mechanism, enhancing its performance with a modest increase in computational effort but a clear improvement in its stability against data noise. The method is formulated in an abstract framework of operator equations and is applicable to a broad range of elliptic inverse problems. Numerical results on electrical impedance tomography, optical tomography and cardiac electrophysiology etc. demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness, especially with an improved accuracy for identifying the locations and geometric shapes of inhomogeneities in the presence of large noise, when compared with the standard DSM.</description>

      <title>From Finite Elements to Hybrid High-Order methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document contains lecture notes from the Ph.D. course given at Scuola Superiore Meridionale by Daniele Di Pietro in February 2025. The goal of the course is to provide an overview of polytopal methods, focusing on the Hybrid High-Order (HHO) method. As a starting point, we study the Crouzeix-Raviart method for a pure diffusion equation, with particular focus on its stability. We then show that, switching to a fully discrete point of view, it is possible to generalize it first to polyhedral meshes and then to arbitrary order, leading to a method that belongs to the HHO family. A study of the stability and consistency of this method reveals the need for a stabilization term, for which we identify two key properties.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving nodal DG method for the Euler equations with gravity: well-balanced, entropy stable, and positivity preserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an entropy stable and positivity preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the Euler equations with gravity, which is also well-balanced for hydrostatic equilibrium states. To achieve these properties, we utilize the nodal DG framework and carefully design the source term discretization using entropy conservative fluxes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology is compatible with a positivity preserving scaling limiter, ensuring positivity of density and pressure under an appropriate CFL condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DG scheme to simultaneously achieve these three properties with theoretical justification. Numerical examples further demonstrate its robustness and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the convergence of the multiscale procedure by Modin, Nachman and Rondi, Adv. Math.

We show that, for the classical multiscale procedure, the multiscale decomposition might fail even for the linear case with a Banach norm as regularization.</description>

      <title>Splitting algorithms for paraxial and It\^o-Schr\"odinger models of wave propagation in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a full discretization procedure to solve wave beam propagation in random media modeled by a paraxial wave equation or an It\^o-Schr\"odinger stochastic partial differential equation. This method bears similarities with the phase screen method used routinely to solve such problems. The main axis of propagation is discretized by a centered splitting scheme with step $\Delta z$ while the transverse variables are treated by a spectral method after appropriate spatial truncation. The originality of our approach is its theoretical validity even when the typical wavelength $\theta$ of the propagating signal satisfies $\theta\ll\Delta z$. More precisely, we obtain a convergence of order $\Delta z$ in mean-square sense while the errors on statistical moments are of order $(\Delta z)^2$ as expected for standard centered splitting schemes. This is a surprising result as splitting schemes typically do not converge when $\Delta z$ is not the smallest scale of the problem. The analysis is based on equations satisfied by statistical moments in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger case and on integral (Duhamel) expansions for the paraxial model. Several numerical simulations illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Deep Univariate Polynomial and Conformal Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep approximation is an approximating function defined by composing more than one layer of simple functions. We study deep approximations of functions of one variable using layers consisting of low-degree polynomials or simple conformal transformations. We show that deep approximations to $|x|$ on $[-1,1]$ achieve exponential convergence with respect to the degrees of freedom. Computational experiments suggest that a composite of two and three polynomial layers can give more accurate approximations than a single polynomial with the same number of coefficients. We also study the related problem of reducing the Runge phenomenon by composing polynomials with conformal transformations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Reduction by Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00768v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel non-linear model reduction method: Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition (PMD), which provides a powerful framework for constructing non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs) by embedding a high-dimensional system into a low-dimensional probabilistic manifold and predicting the dynamics. Through explicit mappings, PMD captures both linearity and non-linearity of the system. A key strength of PMD lies in its predictive capabilities, allowing it to generate stable dynamic states based on embedded representations.
  The method also offers a mathematically rigorous approach to analyze the convergence of linear feature matrices and low-dimensional probabilistic manifolds, ensuring that sample-based approximations converge to the true data distributions as sample sizes increase. These properties, combined with its computational efficiency, make PMD a versatile tool for applications requiring high accuracy and scalability, such as fluid dynamics simulations and other engineering problems. By preserving the geometric and probabilistic structures of the high-dimensional system, PMD achieves a balance between computational speed, accuracy, and predictive capabilities, positioning itself as a robust alternative to the traditional model reduction method.</description>

      <title>On the optimality of convergence conditions for multiscale decompositions in imaging and inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the multiscale procedure developed by Modin, Nachman and Rondi, Adv. Math. (2019), for inverse problems, which was inspired by the multiscale decomposition of images by Tadmor, Nezzar and Vese, Multiscale Model. Simul. (2004). We investigate under which assumptions this classical procedure is enough to have convergence in the unknowns space without resorting to use the tighter multiscale procedure from the same paper. We show that this is the case for linear inverse problems when the regularization is given by the norm of a Hilbert space. Moreover, in this setting the multiscale procedure improves the stability of the reconstruction. On the other hand, we show that, for the classical multiscale procedure, convergence in the unknowns space might fail even for the linear case with a Banach norm as regularization.</description>

      <title>A sharp-interface approach for simulating solid-state dewetting of thin films with double-bubble structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a sharp-interface model for solid-state dewetting of double-bubble thin films using an energy variational approach based on a newly proposed interfacial energy. This model characterizes the dynamic evolution of interfaces in double-bubble thin films, a process primarily governed by surface diffusion and junction/contact points migration, and fundamentally distinct from the behavior observed in a single thin film. Subsequently, a structure-preserving parametric finite element approximation is developed for the sharp-interface model, which can preserve both area conservation and energy stability. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the convergence, structure-preserving properties, and superior mesh quality of the proposed method. Additionally, we investigate several specific evolution processes, including the equilibrium shapes of double-bubble thin films and the pinch-off dynamics of long islands.</description>

Abstract: We make a further step in the open problem of unisolvence for unsymmetric Kansa collocation, proving that the MultiQuadric Kansa method with fixed collocation points and random fictitious centers is almost surely unisolvent, for stationary convection-diffusion equations with mixed boundary conditions on general domains. For the purpose of illustration, the method is applied in 2D with fictitious centers that are local random perturbations of predetermined collocation points.</description>

      <title>A four-field mixed formulation for incompressible finite elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the mass-conserving mixed stress (MCS) finite element method for Stokes equations [Gopalakrishnan J., Lederer P., and Sch\"oberl J., A mass conserving mixed stress formulation for the Stokes equations, IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis 40(3), 1838-1874 (2019)], involving normal velocity and tangential-normal stress continuous fields, to incompressible finite elasticity. By means of the three-field Hu-Washizu principle, introducing the displacement gradient and 1st Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor as additional fields, we circumvent the inversion of the constitutive law. We lift the arising distributional derivatives of the displacement gradient to a regular auxiliary displacement gradient field. Static condensation can be applied at the element level, providing a global pure displacement problem to be solved. We present a stabilization motivated by Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin methods. A solving algorithm is discussed, which asserts the solvability of the arising linearized subproblems for problems with physically positive eigenvalues. The excellent performance of the proposed method is corroborated by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for systems of conservation laws coupled at a sharp interface based on generalized Riemann problems. This method yields a piecewise-linear in time approximation of the solution at the interface, thus, descynchronising the solvers for the coupled systems. We apply this framework to a problem of compressible Euler equations coupled via a gas generator and prove its solvability. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments and show that our algorithm performs at correct convergence rates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a compression algorithm for the Normal-Cycles representations of shape, using the Nystrom approximation in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and Ridge Leverage Score sampling. Our method has theoretical guarantees on the rate of convergence of the compression error, and the obtained approximations are shown to be useful for down-line tasks such as nonlinear shape registration in the Large Deformation Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework, even for very high compression ratios. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated on large-scale shape data from modern geometry processing datasets, and is shown to be fast and scalable with rapid error decay.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent finite element discretization for visco-resistive MHD with thermoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical scheme for classical magnetohydrodynamics, incorporating viscosity, magnetic resistivity, heat transfer, and thermoelectric effect. The governing equations are shown to be derived from a generalized Hamilton's principle, with the resulting weak formulation being mimicked at the discrete level. The resulting numerical method conserves mass and energy, satisfies Gauss' magnetic law and magnetic helicity balance, and adheres to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, all at the fully discrete level. It is shown to perform well on magnetic Rayleigh-B\'enard convection.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical approach for multicontinuum homogenization in high contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently developed upscaling technique, the multicontinuum homogenization method, has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in modeling complex multiscale systems. This method defines multiple continua based on distinct physical properties and solves a series of constrained cell problems to capture localized information for each continuum. However, solving all these cell problems on very fine grids at every macroscopic point is computationally expensive, which is a common limitation of most homogenization approaches for non-periodic problems. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical multicontinuum homogenization framework. The core idea is to define hierarchical macroscopic points and solve the constrained problems on grids of varying resolutions. We assume that the local solutions can be represented as a combination of a linear interpolation of local solutions from preceding levels and an additional correction term. This combination is substituted into the original constrained problems, and the correction term is resolved using finite element (FE) grids of varying sizes, depending on the level of the macropoint. By normalizing the computational cost of fully resolving the local problem to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, we establish that our approach incurs a cost of $\mathcal{O}(L \eta^{(1-L)d})$, highlighting substantial computational savings across hierarchical layers $L$, coarsening factor $\eta$, and spatial dimension $d$. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in media with slowly varying properties, underscoring its potential for efficient multiscale modeling.</description>

      <title>New finite volume element schemes based on a two-layer dual strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-layer dual strategy is proposed in this work to construct a new family of high-order finite volume element (FVE-2L) schemes that can avoid main common drawbacks of the existing high-order finite volume element (FVE) schemes. The existing high-order FVE schemes are complicated to construct since the number of the dual elements in each primary element used in their construction increases with a rate $O((k+1)^2)$, where $k$ is the order of the scheme. Moreover, all $k$th-order FVE schemes require a higher regularity $H^{k+2}$ than the approximation theory for the $L^2$ theory. Furthermore, all FVE schemes lose local conservation properties over boundary dual elements when dealing with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The proposed FVE-2L schemes has a much simpler construction since they have a fixed number (four) of dual elements in each primary element. They also reduce the regularity requirement for the $L^2$ theory to $H^{k+1}$ and preserve the local conservation law on all dual elements of the second dual layer for both flux and equation forms. Their stability and $H^1$ and $L^2$ convergence are proved. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the convergence and conservation properties of the FVE-2L schemes. Moreover, the condition number of the stiffness matrix of the FVE-2L schemes for the Laplacian operator is shown to have the same growth rate as those for the existing FVE and finite element schemes.</description>

      <title>A novel multipoint stress control volume method for linear elasticity on quadrilateral grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel control volume method that is locally conservative and locking-free for linear elasticity problem on quadrilateral grids. The symmetry of stress is weakly imposed through the introduction of a Lagrange multiplier. As such, the method involves three unknowns: stress, displacement and rotation. To ensure the well-posedness of the scheme, a pair of carefully defined finite element spaces is used for the stress, displacement and rotation such that the inf-sup condition holds. An appealing feature of the method is that piecewise constant functions are used for the approximations of stress, displacement and rotation, which greatly simplifies the implementation. In particular, the stress space is defined delicately such that the stress bilinear form is localized around each vertex, which allows for the local elimination of the stress, resulting in a cell-centered system. By choosing different definitions of the space for rotation, we develop two variants of the method. In particular, the first method uses a constant function for rotation over the interaction region, which allows for further elimination and results in a cell-centered system involving displacement only. A rigorous error analysis is performed for the proposed scheme. We show a quasi-optimal approximation (up to data-oscillation term) for $L^2$-error of the stress and rotation without requiring additional regularity assumption. Moreover, we can also prove the superconvergence for discrete $H^1$-error and $L^2$-error of displacement. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that our method is efficient and accurate, and can handle problems with discontinuous coefficients.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of a semi-implicit Euler scheme that is widely used in time discretization of Keller-Segel equations both in the parabolic-elliptic form and the parabolic-parabolic form. We prove that this linear, decoupled, first-order scheme preserves unconditionally the important properties of Keller-Segel equations at the semi-discrete level, including the mass conservation and positivity preserving of the cell density, and the energy dissipation. We also establish optimal error estimates in $L^p$-norm $(1&lt;p&lt;\infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study conformal integrators for linearly damped stochastic Poisson systems. We analyse the qualitative and quantitative properties of these numerical integrators: preservation of dynamics of certain Casimir and Hamiltonian functions, almost sure bounds of the numerical solutions, and strong and weak rates of convergence under appropriate conditions. These theoretical results are illustrated with several numerical experiments on, for example, the linearly damped free rigid body with random inertia tensor or the linearly damped stochastic Lotka--Volterra system.</description>

      <title>The State-Dependent Riccati Equation in Nonlinear Optimal Control: Analysis, Error Estimation and Numerical Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) approach is extensively utilized in nonlinear optimal control as a reliable framework for designing robust feedback control strategies. This work provides an analysis of the SDRE approach, examining its theoretical foundations, error bounds, and numerical approximation techniques. We explore the relationship between SDRE and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, deriving residual-based error estimates to quantify its suboptimality. Additionally, we introduce an optimal semilinear decomposition strategy to minimize the residual. From a computational perspective, we analyze two numerical methods for solving the SDRE: the offline-online approach and the Newton-Kleinman iterative method. Their performance is assessed through a numerical experiment involving the control of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion PDE. Results highlight the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating the superiority of the Newton-Kleinman approach in achieving stable and cost-effective solutions.</description>

      <title>Neural-Enhanced Born Approximation for Inverse Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-harmonic, acoustic inverse scattering concerns the ill-posed and nonlinear problem of determining the refractive index of an inaccessible, penetrable scatterer based on far-field wave scattering data. When the scattering is weak, the Born approximation provides a fast linearized model for recovering the shape and material properties of a scatterer. We develop two neural network algorithms--Born-CNN (BCNN) and CNN-Born (CNNB)--to correct the Born approximation when the scattering is not weak. BCNN applies a post-correction to the Born reconstruction, while CNNB pre-corrects the data. Both methods leverage the Born approximation's excellent fidelity in weak scattering, while extending its applicability beyond its theoretical limits. CNNB particularly exhibits a strong generalization to noisy and absorbing scatterers. Our approach provides a direct and robust method for obtaining the refractive index, extending the utility of the Born approximation to regimes where the traditional method fails.</description>

      <title>Energy-Dissipative Evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Complex PDE Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (EvoKAN), a novel framework for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs). EvoKAN builds on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), where activation functions are spline based and trainable on each edge, offering localized flexibility across multiple scales. Rather than retraining the network repeatedly, EvoKAN encodes only the PDE's initial state during an initial learning phase. The network parameters then evolve numerically, governed by the same PDE, without any additional optimization. By treating these parameters as continuous functions in the relevant coordinates and updating them through time steps, EvoKAN can predict system trajectories over arbitrarily long horizons, a notable challenge for many conventional neural-network based methods. In addition, EvoKAN integrates the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method to guarantee unconditional energy stability and computational efficiency. At individual time step, SAV only needs to solve decoupled linear systems with constant coefficients, the implementation is significantly simplified. We test the proposed framework in several complex PDEs, including one dimensional and two dimensional Allen-Cahn equations and two dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results show that EvoKAN solutions closely match analytical references and established numerical benchmarks, effectively capturing both phase-field phenomena (Allen-Cahn) and turbulent flows (Navier-Stokes).</description>

      <title>Error estimates of asymptotic-preserving neural networks in approximating stochastic linearized Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an asymptotic-preserving neural networks (APNNs) [21] for the linearized Boltzmann equation in the acoustic scaling and with uncertain parameters. Utilizing the micro-macro decomposition, we design the loss function based on the stochastic-Galerkin system conducted from the micro-macro equations. Rigorous analysis is provided to show the capability of neural networks in approximating solutions near the global Maxwellian. By employing hypocoercivity techniques, we demonstrate two key results: the existence of APNNs when the loss function approaches zero, and the convergence of the APNN approximated solution as the loss tends to zero, with the error exhibiting an exponential decay in time.</description>

      <title>A mesh-free hybrid Chebyshev-Tucker tensor format with applications to multi-particle modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mesh-free two-level hybrid Tucker tensor format for approximation of multivariate functions, which combines the product Chebyshev interpolation with the ALS-based Tucker decomposition of the tensor of Chebyshev coefficients. It allows to avoid the expenses of the rank-structured approximation of function-related tensors defined on large spacial grids, while benefiting from the Tucker decomposition of the rather small core tensor of Chebyshev coefficients. This leads to nearly optimal Tucker rank parameters which are close to the results for well established Tucker-ALS algorithm applied to the large grid-based tensors. These rank parameters inherited from the Tucker-ALS decomposition of the coefficient tensor can be much less than the polynomial degrees of the initial Chebyshev interpolant via function independent basis set. Furthermore, the tensor product Chebyshev polynomials discretized on a tensor grid leads to a low-rank two-level orthogonal algebraic Tucker tensor that approximates the initial function with controllable accuracy. It is shown that our techniques could be gainfully applied to the long-range part of the electrostatic potential of multi-particle systems approximated in the range-separated tensor format. Error and complexity estimates of the proposed methods are presented. We demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested method numerically on examples of the long-range components of multi-particle interaction potentials generated by 3D Newton kernel for large bio-molecule systems and lattice-type compounds.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally stable time discretization of Lindblad master equations in infinite dimension using quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the time discretization of Lindblad master equations in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our study is motivated by the fact that, with unbounded Lindbladian, projecting the evolution onto a finite-dimensional subspace using a Galerkin approximation inherently introduces stiffness, leading to a Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy type condition for explicit integration schemes.
  We propose and establish the convergence of a family of explicit numerical schemes for time discretization adapted to infinite dimension. These schemes correspond to quantum channels and thus preserve the physical properties of quantum evolutions on the set of density operators: linearity, complete positivity and trace. Numerical experiments inspired by bosonic quantum codes illustrate the practical interest of this approach when approximating the solution of infinite dimensional problems by that of finite dimensional problems of increasing dimension.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Stiff Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are an effective approach for data-based modeling of dynamical systems arising from simulations and experiments. One of the major shortcomings of NODEs, especially when coupled with explicit integrators, is its long-term stability, which impedes their efficiency and robustness when encountering stiff problems. In this work we present a structure-preserving NODE approach, which integrates with a linear and nonlinear split and an exponential integrator, latter of which is an explicit integrator with stability properties comparable to implicit methods. We demonstrate that our model has advantages in both learning and deployment over standard explicit or even implicit NODE methods. The long-time stability is further enhanced by the Hurwitz matrix decomposition that constrains the spectrum of the linear operator, therefore stabilizing the linearized dynamics. When combined with a Lipschitz-controlled neural network treatment for the nonlinear operator, we show the nonlinear dynamics of the NODE are provably stable in the sense of Lyapunov. For high-dimensional data, we further rely on an autoencoder performing dimension reduction and Higham's algorithm for the matrix-free application of the matrix exponential on a vector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NODE approach in various examples, including the Grad-13 moment equations and the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation.</description>

Abstract: In the present article, we introduce and study a model addressing the Stokes problem with non-linear boundary conditions of the Tresca type. We suggest a new procedure for regularizing incompressible fluid, i.e. we assume that the divergence $\nabla \cdot {\bf u}\in [-\epsilon,\,\epsilon]$ which leads to class of constrained elliptic variational inequalities. We use a fixed point strategy to show the existence and uniqueness of a solution and we reformulate the problem as an equivalent constrained minimization problem. An ADMM is applied to the minimization problem and some algorithm are provided.</description>

      <title>Condenser Pressure Influence on Ideal Steam Rankine Power Vapor Cycle using the Python Extension Package Cantera for Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the Rankine vapor power thermodynamic cycle using steam/water as the working fluid, which is common in commercial power plants for power generation as the source of the rotary shaft power needed to drive electric generators. The four-process cycle version, which comprises a water pump section, a boiler/superheater section, a steam turbine section, and a condenser section, was considered. The performance of this thermodynamic power cycle depends on several design parameters. This study varied a single independent variable, the absolute pressure of the condenser, by a factor of 256, from 0.78125 to 200 kPa. The peak pressure and peak temperature in the cycle were fixed at 50 bar (5,000 kPa) and 600{\deg}C, respectively, corresponding to a base case with a base value for the condenser's absolute pressure of 12.5 kPa (0.125 bar). The analysis was performed using the thermodynamics software package Cantera as an extension of the Python programming language. The results suggest that over the range of condenser pressures examined, a logarithmic function can be deployed to describe the dependence of input heat, the net output work, and cycle efficiency on the absolute pressure of the condenser. Each of these three performance metrics decreases as the absolute pressure of the condenser increases. However, a power function is a better choice to describe how the steam dryness (steam quality) at the end of the turbine section increases as the absolute pressure of the condenser rises.</description>

      <title>Cauchy Random Features for Operator Learning in Sobolev Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning is the approximation of operators between infinite dimensional Banach spaces using machine learning approaches. While most progress in this area has been driven by variants of deep neural networks such as the Deep Operator Network and Fourier Neural Operator, the theoretical guarantees are often in the form of a universal approximation property. However, the existence theorems do not guarantee that an accurate operator network is obtainable in practice. Motivated by the recent kernel-based operator learning framework, we propose a random feature operator learning method with theoretical guarantees and error bounds. The random feature method can be viewed as a randomized approximation of a kernel method, which significantly reduces the computation requirements for training. We provide a generalization error analysis for our proposed random feature operator learning method along with comprehensive numerical results. Compared to kernel-based method and neural network methods, the proposed method can obtain similar or better test errors across benchmarks examples with significantly reduced training times. An additional advantages it that our implementation is simple and does require costly computational resources, such as GPU.</description>

      <title>DeepONet Augmented by Randomized Neural Networks for Efficient Operator Learning in PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep operator networks (DeepONets) represent a powerful class of data-driven methods for operator learning, demonstrating strong approximation capabilities for a wide range of linear and nonlinear operators. They have shown promising performance in learning operators that govern partial differential equations (PDEs), including diffusion-reaction systems and Burgers' equations. However, the accuracy of DeepONets is often constrained by computational limitations and optimization challenges inherent in training deep neural networks. Furthermore, the computational cost associated with training these networks is typically very high. To address these challenges, we leverage randomized neural networks (RaNNs), in which the parameters of the hidden layers remain fixed following random initialization. RaNNs compute the output layer parameters using the least-squares method, significantly reducing training time and mitigating optimization errors. In this work, we integrate DeepONets with RaNNs to propose RaNN-DeepONets, a hybrid architecture designed to balance accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, to mitigate the need for extensive data preparation, we introduce the concept of physics-informed RaNN-DeepONets. Instead of relying on data generated through other time-consuming numerical methods, we incorporate PDE information directly into the training process. We evaluate the proposed model on three benchmark PDE problems: diffusion-reaction dynamics, Burgers' equation, and the Darcy flow problem. Through these tests, we assess its ability to learn nonlinear operators with varying input types. When compared to the standard DeepONet framework, RaNN-DeepONets achieves comparable accuracy while reducing computational costs by orders of magnitude. These results highlight the potential of RaNN-DeepONets as an efficient alternative for operator learning in PDE-based systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical search for three-body periodic free-fall orbits with central symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A specialized high-precision numerical search for equal-mass collisionless three-body periodic free-fall orbits with central symmetry is conducted. The search is based on Newton's method with initial approximations obtained by the grid-search method. Instead of solving the standard periodicity equation on the entire period a quarter-period equation that also characterizes the periodic orbits is solved. The number of the known orbits from the class is significantly enlarged. The linear stability of the orbits is also investigated. All of them are unstable. A discussion in relation to the efficiency of Newton's method applied with grid-search initial approximations is held.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric spectral density estimation from irregularly sampled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric spectral density estimator for fully irregularly sampled points in one or more dimensions, constructed using a weighted nonuniform Fourier sum whose weights yield a high-accuracy quadrature rule for a user-specified window function. The resulting estimator significantly reduces the aliasing seen in periodogram approaches and least squares spectral analysis, sidesteps the dangers of ill-conditioning of the nonuniform Fourier inverse problem, and can be adapted to a wide variety of irregular sampling settings. After a discussion of methods for computing the necessary weights and a theoretical analysis of sources of bias, we close with demonstrations of the method's efficacy, including for processes that exhibit very slow spectral decay and for processes in multiple dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We derive a path-kernel formula for the linear response of SDEs, where the perturbation applies to initial conditions, drift coefficients, and diffusion coefficients. It tempers the unstableness by gradually moving the path-perturbation to hit the probability kernel. Then we derive a pathwise sampling algorithm and demonstrate it on the Lorenz 96 system with noise.</description>

      <title>On the use of the principle of maximum entropy in bivariate splines least-squares approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fitting a bivariate spline regression model to data using a weighted least-squares cost function, with weights that sum to one to form a discrete probability distribution. By applying the principle of maximum entropy, the weight distribution is determined by maximizing the associated entropy function. This approach, previously applied successfully to polynomials and spline curves, enhances the robustness of the regression model by automatically detecting and down-weighting anomalous data during the fitting process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we present applications to two image processing problems and further illustrate its potential through two synthetic examples.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel kernel-based framework for learning differential equations and their solution maps that is efficient in data requirements, in terms of solution examples and amount of measurements from each example, and computational cost, in terms of training procedures. Our approach is mathematically interpretable and backed by rigorous theoretical guarantees in the form of quantitative worst-case error bounds for the learned equation. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in computational complexity and robustness while achieving one to two orders of magnitude improvements in terms of accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Structured Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a ubiquitous modeling framework that finds applications in physics, biology, engineering, social science, and finance. Due to the availability of large-scale data sets, there is growing interest in learning mechanistic models from observations with stochastic noise. In this work, we present a nonparametric framework to learn both the drift and diffusion terms in systems of SDEs where the stochastic noise is singular. Specifically, inspired by second-order equations from classical physics, we consider systems which possess structured noise, i.e. noise with a singular covariance matrix. We provide an algorithm for constructing estimators given trajectory data and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods via a number of examples from physics and biology. As the developed framework is most naturally applicable to systems possessing a high degree of dimensionality reduction (i.e. symmetry), we also apply it to the high dimensional Cucker-Smale flocking model studied in collective dynamics and show that it is able to accurately infer the low dimensional interaction kernel from particle data.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Ray Tracing and Rayleigh Fading Models for Distributed MIMO Systems in Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed analysis of coverage in a factory environment using realistic 3D map data to evaluate the benefits of Distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) over colocalized approach. Our study emphasizes the importance of network densification in enhancing D-MIMO performance, ensuring that User Equipment (UE) remains within range of multiple Access Points (APs). To assess MIMO capacity, we compare two propagation channel models: ray tracing and stochastic. While ray tracing provides accurate predictions by considering environmental details and consistent correlations within the MIMO response, stochastic models offer a more generalized and efficient approach. The analysis outlines the strengths and limitations of each model when applied to the simulation of the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) single-user capacity in various D-MIMO deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence to the optimal risk for Adam and stochastic gradient descent optimization in the training of deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the omnipresent use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods in the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), it remains, in basically all practically relevant scenarios, a fundamental open problem to provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for the success (and the limitations) of SGD optimization methods in deep learning. In particular, it remains an open question to prove or disprove convergence of the true risk of SGD optimization methods to the optimal true risk value in the training of DNNs. In one of the main results of this work we reveal for a general class of activations, loss functions, random initializations, and SGD optimization methods (including, for example, standard SGD, momentum SGD, Nesterov accelerated SGD, Adagrad, RMSprop, Adadelta, Adam, Adamax, Nadam, Nadamax, and AMSGrad) that in the training of any arbitrary fully-connected feedforward DNN it does not hold that the true risk of the considered optimizer converges in probability to the optimal true risk value. Nonetheless, the true risk of the considered SGD optimization method may very well converge to a strictly suboptimal true risk value.</description>

Abstract: By incorporating a new matrix splitting and the momentum acceleration into the relaxed-based matrix splitting (RMS) method \cite{soso2023}, a generalization of the RMS (GRMS) iterative method for solving the generalized absolute value equations (GAVEs) is proposed. On the one hand, unlike some existing methods, by using the Cauchy's convergence principle we give some sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution to GAVEs and prove that our method can converge to the unique solution of GAVEs. On the other hand, we obtain a few new and weaker convergence conditions for some existing methods. Moreover, we establish comparison theorems between GRMS method and some existing methods. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the proposed method is efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate and analyse a geometric low-regularity integrator for solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in the $d$-dimensional space with $d=1,2,3$. The integrator is constructed based on the two-step trigonometric method and thus it has a simple form. Error estimates are rigorously presented to show that the integrator can achieve second-order time accuracy in the energy space under the regularity requirement in $H^{1+\frac{d}{4}}\times H^{\frac{d}{4}}$. Moreover, the time symmetry of the scheme ensures its good long-time energy, momentum and action conservations which are rigorously proved by the technique of modulated Fourier expansions. A numerical test is presented and the numerical results demonstrate the superiorities of the new integrator over some existing methods.</description>

      <title>High-order WENO finite-difference methods for hyperbolic nonconservative systems of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to extend the well-known high-order WENO finite-difference methods for systems of conservation laws to nonconservative hyperbolic systems. The main difficulty of these systems both from the theoretical and the numerical points of view comes from the fact that the definition of weak solution is not unique: according to the theory developed by Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat in 1995, it depends on the choice of a family of paths. A new strategy is introduced here that allows non-conservative products to be written as the derivative of a generalized flux function that is defined locally on the basis of the selected family of paths. WENO reconstructions are then applied to this generalized flux. Moreover, if a Roe linearization is available, the generalized flux function can be evaluated through matrix vector operations instead of path-integrals. Two different known techniques are used to extend the methods to problems with source terms and the well-balanced properties of the resulting schemes are studied. These numerical schemes are applied to a coupled Burgers system and to the two-layer shallow water equations in one- and two- dimensions to obtain high-order methods that preserve water-at-rest steady states.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Algorithm for Systems of Non-interacting Particles with an External Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our focus is on simulating the dynamics of non-interacting particles including the effects of an external potential, which, under certain assumptions, can be formally described by the Dean-Kawasaki equation. The Dean-Kawasaki equation can be solved numerically using standard finite volume methods. However, the numerical approximation implicitly requires a sufficiently large number of particles to ensure the positivity of the solution and accurate approximation of the stochastic flux. To address this challenge, we extend hybrid algorithms for particle systems to scenarios where the density is low. The aim is to create a hybrid algorithm that switches from a finite volume discretization to a particle-based method when the particle density falls below a certain threshold. We develop criteria for determining this threshold by comparing higher-order statistics obtained from the finite volume method with particle simulations. We then demonstrate the use of the resulting criteria for dynamic adaptation in both two- and three-dimensional spatial settings in the absence of an external potential. Finally we consider the dynamics when an external potential is included.</description>

      <title>Optimal solutions employing an algebraic Variational Multiscale approach Part I: Steady Linear Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work extends our previous study from S. Shrestha et al. (2024) by introducing a new abstract framework for Variational Multiscale (VMS) methods at the discrete level. We introduce the concept of what we define as the optimal projector and present a discretisation approach that yields a numerical solution closely approximating the optimal projection of the infinite-dimensional continuous solution. In this approach, the infinite-dimensional unresolved scales are approximated in a finite-dimensional subspace using the numerically computed Fine-Scale Greens' function of the underlying symmetric problem. The proposed approach involves solving the VMS problem on two separate meshes: a coarse mesh for the full PDE and a fine mesh for the symmetric part of the continuous differential operator. We consider the 1D and 2D steady advection-diffusion problems in both direct and mixed formulations as the test cases in this paper. We first present an error analysis of the proposed approach and show that the projected solution is achieved as the approximate Greens' function converges to the exact one. Subsequently, we demonstrate the working of this method where we show that it can exponentially converge to the chosen optimal projection. We note that the implementation of the present work employs the Mimetic Spectral Element Method (MSEM), although, it may be applied to other Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric frameworks. Furthermore, we propose that VMS should not be viewed as a stabilisation technique; instead, the base scheme should be inherently stable, with VMS enhancing the solution quality by supplementing the base scheme.</description>

      <title>Two-level Restricted Additive Schwarz preconditioner based on Multiscale Spectral Generalized FEM for Heterogeneous Helmholtz Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze a two-level restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner for heterogeneous Helmholtz problems, based on a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) proposed in [C. Ma, C. Alber, and R. Scheichl, SIAM. J. Numer. Anal., 61 (2023), pp. 1546--1584]. The preconditioner uses local solves with impedance boundary conditions, and a global coarse solve based on the MS-GFEM approximation space constructed from local eigenproblems. It is derived by first formulating MS-GFEM as a Richardson iterative method, and without using an oversampling technique, reduces to the preconditioner recently proposed and analyzed in [Q. Hu and Z.Li, arXiv 2402.06905].
  We prove that both the Richardson iterative method and the preconditioner used within GMRES converge at a rate of $\Lambda$ under some reasonable conditions, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error of the underlying MS-GFEM \rs{approximation}. Notably, the convergence proof of GMRES does not rely on the `Elman theory'. An exponential convergence property of MS-GFEM, resulting from oversampling, ensures that only a few iterations are needed for convergence with a small coarse space. Moreover, the convergence rate $\Lambda$ is not only independent of the fine-mesh size $h$ and the number of subdomains, but decays with increasing wavenumber $k$. In particular, in the constant-coefficient case, with $h\sim k^{-1-\gamma}$ for some $\gamma\in (0,1]$, it holds that $\Lambda \sim k^{-1+\frac{\gamma}{2}}$. We present extensive numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the preconditioner, including 2D and 3D benchmark geophysics tests, and a high-contrast coefficient example arising in applications.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, having a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for avoiding sign problems. Typically, this trial wavefunction is fixed throughout the simulation. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems, achieving a relative error of \(10^{-5}\) in estimating ground-state energies. Additionally, the overlap between our estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction achieves a high-fidelity. Our algorithm exhibits advantages over density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We also provide a convergence proof, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimation.</description>

      <title>Data-driven parameterization refinement for the structural optimization of cruise ship hulls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the early design phase of cruise ship hulls, where the designers are tasked with ensuring the structural resilience of the ship against extreme waves while reducing steel usage and respecting safety and manufacturing constraints. The ship's geometry is already finalized and the designer can choose the thickness of the primary structural elements, such as decks, bulkheads, and the shell. Reduced order modeling and black-box optimization techniques reduce the use of expensive finite element analysis to only validate the most promising configurations, thanks to the efficient exploration of the domain of decision variables. However, the quality of the results heavily relies on the problem formulation, and on how the structural elements are assigned to the decision variables. A parameterization that does not capture well the stress configuration of the model prevents the optimization procedure from achieving the most efficient allocation of the steel. To address this issue, we extended an existing pipeline for the structural optimization of cruise ships developed in collaboration with Fincantieri S.p.A. with a novel data-driven reparameterization procedure, based on the optimization of a series of sub-problems. Moreover, we implemented a multi-objective optimization module to provide the designers with insights into the efficient trade-offs between competing quantities of interest and enhanced the single-objective Bayesian optimization module. The new pipeline is tested on a simplified midship section and a full ship hull, comparing the automated reparameterization to a baseline model provided by the designers. The tests show that the iterative refinement outperforms the baseline on the more complex hull, proving that the pipeline streamlines the initial design phase, and helps the designers tackle more innovative projects.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation based on duality to solve partial differential equations: Use of B-splines and machine learning approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Navier--Stokes equations in fluid mechanics, inelastic deformation in solids, and transient parabolic and hyperbolic equations do not have an exact, primal variational structure. Recently, a variational principle based on the dual (Lagrange multiplier) field was proposed. The essential idea in this approach is to treat the given PDEs as constraints, and to invoke an arbitrarily chosen auxiliary potential with strong convexity properties to be optimized. On requiring the vanishing of the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the primal variables, a mapping from the dual to the primal fields is obtained. This leads to requiring a convex dual functional to be minimized subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual variables, with the guarantee that even PDEs that do not possess a variational structure in primal form can be solved via a variational principle. The vanishing of the first variation of the dual functional is, up to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual fields, the weak form of the primal PDE problem with the dual-to-primal change of variables incorporated. We derive the dual weak form for the linear, one-dimensional, transient convection-diffusion equation. A Galerkin discretization is used, with the trial and test functions chosen as linear combination of either shallow neural networks with RePU activation functions or B-splines; the corresponding stiffness matrix is symmetric. For transient problems, a space-time Galerkin implementation is used with tensor-product B-splines as approximating functions. Numerical results are presented for the steady-state and transient convection-diffusion equation, and transient heat conduction. The proposed method delivers sound accuracy for ODEs and PDEs and rates of convergence are established in the $L^2$ norm and $H^1$ seminorm for the steady-state convection-diffusion problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose novel methods for approximate sampling recovery and integration of functions in the Freud-weighted Sobolev space $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$ with the approximation error measured in the norm of the Freud-weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R})$. Namely, we construct equidistant compact-supported B-spline quasi-interpolation and interpolation sampling algorithms $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$ which are asymptotically optimal in terms of the sampling $n$-widths $\varrho_n(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}), L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R}))$ for every pair $p,q \in [1,\infty]$, and prove the right convergence rate of these sampling $n$-widths, where $\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the unit ball in $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$. The algorithms $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$ are based on truncated scaled B-spline quasi-interpolation and interpolation, respectively. We also prove the asymptotical optimality and right convergence rate of the equidistant quadratures generated from $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$, for Freud-weighted numerical integration of functions in $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Reduced Rank Extrapolation to Low-Rank Matrix Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced rank extrapolation (RRE) is an acceleration method typically used to accelerate the iterative solution of nonlinear systems of equations using a fixed-point process. In this context, the iterates are vectors generated from a fixed-point mapping function. However, when considering the iterative solution of large-scale matrix equations, the iterates are low-rank matrices generated from a fixed-point process for which, generally, the mapping function changes in each iteration. To enable acceleration of the iterative solution for these problems, we propose two novel generalizations of RRE. First, we show how to effectively compute RRE for sequences of low-rank matrices. Second, we derive a formulation of RRE that is suitable for fixed-point processes for which the mapping function changes each iteration. We demonstrate the potential of the methods on several numerical examples involving the iterative solution of large-scale Lyapunov and Riccati matrix equations.</description>

      <title>Learning Hamiltonian Systems with Pseudo-symplectic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduces a Pseudo-Symplectic Neural Network (PSNN) for learning general Hamiltonian systems (both separable and non-separable) from data. To address the limitations of existing structure-preserving methods (e.g., implicit symplectic integrators restricted to separable systems or explicit approximations requiring high computational costs), PSNN integrates an explicit pseudo-symplectic integrator as its dynamical core, achieving nearly exact symplecticity with minimal structural error. Additionally, the authors propose learnable Pad\'e-type activation functions based on Pad\'e approximation theory, which empirically outperform classical ReLU, Taylor-based activations, and PAU. By combining these innovations, PSNN demonstrates superior performance in learning and forecasting diverse Hamiltonian systems (e.g., modified pendulum, galactic dynamics), surpassing state-of-the-art models in accuracy, long-term stability, and energy preservation, while requiring shorter training time, fewer samples, and reduced parameters. This framework bridges the gap between computational efficiency and geometric structure preservation in Hamiltonian system modeling.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between two Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra integral equations of the second kind and their further improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two different Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra integral equations of the second kind have been independently proposed by Stenger and Rashidinia--Zarebnia. However, their relationship remains unexplored. This study theoretically examines the solutions of these two methods, and reveals that they are not generally equivalent, despite coinciding at the collocation points. Strictly speaking, Stenger's method assumes that the kernel of the integral is a function of a single variable, but this study theoretically justifies the use of his method in general cases, i.e., the kernel is a function of two variables. Then, this study rigorously proves that both methods can attain the same, root-exponential convergence. In addition to the contribution, this study improves Stenger's method to attain significantly higher, almost exponential convergence. Numerical examples supporting the theoretical results are also provided.</description>

      <title>Penalized Principal Component Analysis Using Smoothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal components computed via PCA (principal component analysis) are traditionally used to reduce dimensionality in genomic data or to correct for population stratification. In this paper, we explore the penalized eigenvalue problem (PEP) which reformulates the computation of the first eigenvector as an optimization problem and adds an $L_1$ penalty constraint to enforce sparseness of the solution. The contribution of our article is threefold. First, we extend PEP by applying smoothing to the original LASSO-type $L_1$ penalty. This allows one to compute analytical gradients which enable faster and more efficient minimization of the objective function associated with the optimization problem. Second, we demonstrate how higher order eigenvectors can be calculated with PEP using established results from singular value decomposition (SVD). Third, we present four experimental studies to demonstrate the usefulness of the smoothed penalized eigenvectors. Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset, we empirically demonstrate that our proposed smoothed PEP allows one to increase numerical stability and obtain meaningful eigenvectors. We also employ the penalized eigenvector approach in two additional real data applications (computation of a polygenic risk score and clustering), demonstrating that exchanging the penalized eigenvectors for their smoothed counterparts can increase prediction accuracy in polygenic risk scores and enhance discernibility of clusterings. Moreover, we compare our proposed smoothed PEP to seven state-of-the-art algorithms for sparse PCA and evaluate the accuracy of the obtained eigenvectors, their support recovery, and their runtime.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Zeroth- and First-order Stochastic Trust-Region Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model update (MU) and candidate evaluation (CE) are classical steps incorporated inside many stochastic trust-region (TR) algorithms. The sampling effort exerted within these steps, often decided with the aim of controlling model error, largely determines a stochastic TR algorithm's sample complexity. Given that MU and CE are amenable to variance reduction, we investigate the effect of incorporating common random numbers (CRN) within MU and CE on complexity. Using ASTRO and ASTRO-DF as prototype first-order and zeroth-order families of algorithms, we demonstrate that CRN's effectiveness leads to a range of complexities depending on sample-path regularity and the oracle order. For instance, we find that in first-order oracle settings with smooth sample paths, CRN's effect is pronounced -- ASTRO with CRN achieves $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ a.s. sample complexity compared to $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ a.s. in the generic no-CRN setting. By contrast, CRN's effect is muted when the sample paths are not Lipschitz, with the sample complexity improving from $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ a.s. to $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ a.s. in the zeroth- and first-order settings, respectively. Since our results imply that improvements in complexity are largely inherited from generic aspects of variance reduction, e.g., finite-differencing for zeroth-order settings and sample-path smoothness for first-order settings within MU, we anticipate similar trends in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Minimal Variance Model Aggregation: A principled, non-intrusive, and versatile integration of black box models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether deterministic or stochastic, models can be viewed as functions designed to approximate a specific quantity of interest. We introduce Minimal Empirical Variance Aggregation (MEVA), a data-driven framework that integrates predictions from various models, enhancing overall accuracy by leveraging the individual strengths of each. This non-intrusive, model-agnostic approach treats the contributing models as black boxes and accommodates outputs from diverse methodologies, including machine learning algorithms and traditional numerical solvers. We advocate for a point-wise linear aggregation process and consider two methods for optimizing this aggregate: Minimal Error Aggregation (MEA), which minimizes the prediction error, and Minimal Variance Aggregation (MVA), which focuses on reducing variance. We prove a theorem showing that MVA can be more robustly estimated from data than MEA, making MEVA superior to Minimal Empirical Error Aggregation (MEEA). Unlike MEEA, which interpolates target values directly, MEVA formulates aggregation as an error estimation problem, which can be performed using any backbone learning paradigm. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our framework across various applications, including data science and partial differential equations, illustrating its ability to significantly enhance both robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>How Discrete and Continuous Diffusion Meet: Comprehensive Analysis of Discrete Diffusion Models via a Stochastic Integral Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have gained increasing attention for their ability to model complex distributions with tractable sampling and inference. However, the error analysis for discrete diffusion models remains less well-understood. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework for the error analysis of discrete diffusion models based on L\'evy-type stochastic integrals. By generalizing the Poisson random measure to that with a time-independent and state-dependent intensity, we rigorously establish a stochastic integral formulation of discrete diffusion models and provide the corresponding change of measure theorems that are intriguingly analogous to It\^o integrals and Girsanov's theorem for their continuous counterparts. Our framework unifies and strengthens the current theoretical results on discrete diffusion models and obtains the first error bound for the $\tau$-leaping scheme in KL divergence. With error sources clearly identified, our analysis gives new insight into the mathematical properties of discrete diffusion models and offers guidance for the design of efficient and accurate algorithms for real-world discrete diffusion model applications.</description>

      <title>Linear cost and exponentially convergent approximation of Gaussian Mat\'ern processes on intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational cost for inference and prediction of statistical models based on Gaussian processes with Mat\'ern covariance functions scales cubicly with the number of observations, limiting their applicability to large data sets. The cost can be reduced in certain special cases, but there are currently no generally applicable exact methods with linear cost. Several approximate methods have been introduced to reduce the cost, but most of these lack theoretical guarantees for the accuracy. We consider Gaussian processes on bounded intervals with Mat\'ern covariance functions and for the first time develop a generally applicable method with linear cost and with a covariance error that decreases exponentially fast in the order $m$ of the proposed approximation. The method is based on an optimal rational approximation of the spectral density and results in an approximation that can be represented as a sum of $m$ independent Gaussian Markov processes, which facilitates easy usage in general software for statistical inference, enabling its efficient implementation in general statistical inference software packages. Besides the theoretical justifications, we demonstrate the accuracy empirically through carefully designed simulation studies which show that the method outperforms all state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy for a fixed computational cost in statistical tasks such as Gaussian process regression.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Fokker-Planck PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The state uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF. Our main contribution is the analysis of PINN approximation error: we develop a theoretical framework to construct tight error bounds using PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with standard training methods. We discuss that this error-bound framework generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Empirical results on nonlinear, high-dimensional, and chaotic systems validate the correctness of our error bounds while demonstrating the scalability of PINNs and their significant computational speedup in obtaining accurate PDF solutions compared to the Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Semialgebraic Neural Networks: From roots to representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many numerical algorithms in scientific computing -- particularly in areas like numerical linear algebra, PDE simulation, and inverse problems -- produce outputs that can be represented by semialgebraic functions; that is, the graph of the computed function can be described by finitely many polynomial equalities and inequalities. In this work, we introduce Semialgebraic Neural Networks (SANNs), a neural network architecture capable of representing any bounded semialgebraic function, and computing such functions up to the accuracy of a numerical ODE solver chosen by the programmer. Conceptually, we encode the graph of the learned function as the kernel of a piecewise polynomial selected from a class of functions whose roots can be evaluated using a particular homotopy continuation method. We show by construction that the SANN architecture is able to execute this continuation method, thus evaluating the learned semialgebraic function. Furthermore, the architecture can exactly represent even discontinuous semialgebraic functions by executing a continuation method on each connected component of the target function. Lastly, we provide example applications of these networks and show they can be trained with traditional deep-learning techniques.</description>

      <title>PEARL: Preconditioner Enhancement through Actor-critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PEARL (Preconditioner Enhancement through Actor-critic Reinforcement Learning), a novel approach to learning matrix preconditioners. Existing preconditioners such as Jacobi, Incomplete LU, and Algebraic Multigrid methods offer problem-specific advantages but rely heavily on hyperparameter tuning. Recent advances have explored using deep neural networks to learn preconditioners, though challenges such as misbehaved objective functions and costly training procedures remain. PEARL introduces a reinforcement learning approach for learning preconditioners, specifically, a contextual bandit formulation. The framework utilizes an actor-critic model, where the actor generates the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of preconditioners, and the critic evaluates them based on reward-specific feedback. To further guide the training, we design a dual-objective function, combining updates from the critic and condition number. PEARL contributes a generalizable preconditioner learning method, dynamic sparsity exploration, and cosine schedulers for improved stability and exploratory power. We compare our approach to traditional and neural preconditioners, demonstrating improved flexibility and iterative solving speed.</description>
