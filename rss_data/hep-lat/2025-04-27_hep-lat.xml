      <title>Lecture Notes on Normalizing Flows for Lattice Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum field theories on lattices serve as a fundamental tool for studying the non-perturbative regime of the theories, where analytic tools often fall short. Challenges arise when one takes the continuum limit or as the system approaches a critical point, especially in the presence of non-trivial topological structures in the theory. Rapid recent advances in machine learning provide a promising avenue for progress in this area. These lecture notes aim to give a brief account of lattice field theories, normalizing flows, and how the latter can be applied to study the former. The notes are based on the lectures given by the first author in various recent research schools.</description>

      <title>Locating Critical Points Using Ratios of Lee-Yang Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon $g-2$ from lattice QCD: Long-distance and full light-quark connected contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for the dominant light-quark connected contribution to the long-distance window (LD) of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution (HVP) to the muon $g-2$ from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, with a new determination of the lattice scale on MILC's physical-mass HISQ ensembles, using the $\Omega^-$ baryon mass, we obtain a result of $400.2(2.3)_{\mathrm{stat}}(3.7)_{\mathrm{syst}}[4.3]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. Summing this result with our recent determinations of the light-quark connected contributions to the short- (SD) and intermediate-distance (W) windows, we obtain a sub-percent precision determination of the light-quark-connected contribution to HVP of $655.5(2.3)_{\mathrm{stat}}(3.9)_{\mathrm{syst}}[4.5]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. Finally, as a consistency check, we verify that an independent analysis of the full contribution is in agreement with the sum of individual windows. We discuss our future plans for improvements of our HVP calculations to meet the target precision of the Fermilab $g-2$ experiment.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Anomalies of Hamiltonian Staggered Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the shift (translation) and time reversal symmetries of Hamiltonian staggered fermions and their connection to continuum symmetries concentrating in particular on the case of massless fermions and (3+1) dimensions. We construct operators using the staggered fields that implement these symmetries on finite lattices. We show that shifts composed of an odd multiple of the elementary shift anti-commute with time reversal and are related to continuum axial transformations. We argue that the presence of these non-trivial commutators implies the existence of exact lattice 't Hooft anomalies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Truncations of SU($N_c$) Lattice Gauge Theory for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Can we determine the exact size of the nucleon?: A comprehensive study of different radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of nucleon radii plays a central role in our understanding of the internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing critical insights into the non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While the charge radius is often interpreted as the ``size" of the nucleon, this interpretation is an oversimplification that overlooks the multifaceted nature of nucleon structure. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different nucleon radii, including the charge and magnetic radii, the axial radius, and the emerging concepts of mechanical and mass radii. We discuss the definitions as well as the experimental, theoretical and phenomenological determinations of these radii, highlighting their distinct physical origins and implications. By synthesizing recent experimental results and theoretical advancements, we emphasize that each radius reflects a specific aspect of the nucleon's internal structure, such as its electric charge distribution, magnetic properties, weak interactions, or internal mechanical stress. In particular, we address the common but misleading interpretation of the proton radius as a simple measure of its size, underscoring the nuanced and context-dependent nature of nucleon radii. Through this exploration, we aim to clarify the roles of these radii in characterizing nucleon structure and to identify open questions that remain to be addressed. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the nucleon and its significance in the broader context of particle and nuclear physics.</description>
