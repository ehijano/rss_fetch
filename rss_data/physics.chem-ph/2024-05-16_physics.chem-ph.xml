      <title>General expressions for Stevens and Racah operator equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several definitions of the crystal field have been used over time and their variety has lead to many misunderstandings, in both theoretical and experimental literature. Two categories of definitions can be mentioned, the first being the operators equivalents introduced by Stevens in 1952 and the second being the crystal-field operators, introduced by different authors from 1962 and expanded on the Racah spherical tensors. This paper aims at providing some clarification in this field. We first make a review of several expressions introduced in various references to compute crystal-field operators and we describe connections between them. Then, we introduce an explicit way to compute crystal-field operators, in terms of angular momentum quantum numbers $j$ and $m$ as well as in terms of $J^2$ and $J_z$ operators. We eventually give some connections between the Stevens operators equivalents and the crystal-field operators, and make usage of the coefficients of fractional parentage for the expression of the crystal-field operators for the many-body states. Various computational codes, using different crystal-field conventions, are also reviewed.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum master equations can improve the accuracy of semiclassical predictions of multitime correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multitime quantum correlation functions are central objects in physical science, offering a direct link between experimental observables and the dynamics of an underlying model. While experiments such as 2D spectroscopy and quantum control can now measure such quantities, the accurate simulation of such responses remains computationally expensive and sometimes impossible, depending on the system's complexity. A natural tool to employ is the generalized quantum master equation (GQME), which can offer computational savings by extending reference dynamics at a comparatively trivial cost. However, dynamical methods that can tackle chemical systems with atomistic resolution, such as those in the semiclassical hierarchy, often suffer from poor accuracy, limiting the credence one might lend to their results. By combining work on the accuracy-boosting formulation of semiclassical memory kernels with recent work on the multitime GQME, here we show for the first time that one can exploit a multitime semiclassical GQME to dramatically improve both the accuracy of coarse mean-field Ehrenfest dynamics and obtain orders of magnitude efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>Spin Symmetry in Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For electronic systems with multi-reference (MR) character, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with the conventional exchange-correlation (xc) energy functionals can lead to incorrect spin densities and related properties. For example, for H2 dissociation, the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted solutions obtained with the same xc energy functional in KS-DFT can be distinctly different, yielding the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking effects in the spin-unrestricted solutions. Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) has been shown to resolve the aforementioned spin-symmetry breaking, when the fictitious temperature is properly chosen. In this work, a response theory based on TAO-DFT is developed to demonstrate that TAO-DFT with a sufficiently large fictitious temperature can always resolve the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking in MR systems. To further support this, TAO-DFT calculations with various fictitious temperatures are performed for the dissociation of H2, N2, He2, and Ne2 as well as the twisted ethylene.</description>

      <title>Isotope effect on the anomalies of water: a corresponding states analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09010v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light and heavy water show similar anomalies in thermodynamic and dynamic properties, with a consistent trend of anomalies occurring at higher temperature in heavy water. Viscosity also increases faster upon cooling in heavy water, causing a giant isotope effect, with a viscosity ratio near 2.4 at 244 K. While a simple temperature shift apparently helps in collapsing experimental data for both isotopes, it lacks a clear justification, changes value with the property considered, and requires additional ad hoc scaling factors. Here we use a corresponding states analysis based on the possible existence of a liquid-liquid critical point in supercooled water. This provides a coherent framework which leads to the collapse of thermodynamic data. The ratio between dynamic properties of the isotopes is strongly reduced. In particular, the decoupling between viscosity $\eta$ and self-diffusion $D$, measured as a function of temperature $T$ by the Stokes-Einstein ratio $D\eta/T$, is found to collapse after applying the corresponding states analysis. Our results are consistent with simulations and suggest that the various isotope effects mirror the one on the liquid-liquid transition.</description>

      <title>Interfaces Govern Structure of Angstrom-scale Confined Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water plays a crucial role in geological, biological, and technological processes. Nanoscale water confinement occurs in many of these settings, including sedimentary rocks, water channel proteins, and applications like desalination and water purification membranes. The structure and properties of water in nanoconfinement can differ significantly from bulk water, exhibiting, for instance, modified hydrogen bonds, dielectric constant, and phase transitions. Despite the importance of strongly nanoconfined water, experimentally elucidating the nanoconfinement effect on water, such as its orientation and hydrogen bond (H-bond) network, has remained challenging. Here, we study two-dimensionally nanoconfined aqueous electrolyte solutions with tunable confinement from nanoscale to angstrom-scale sandwiched between a graphene sheet and CaF2. We employ heterodyne-detection sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy, a surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy capable of directly and selective probing water orientation and H-bond environment at interfaces and under confinement. Remarkably, the vibrational spectra of the nanoscale confined water can be described quantitatively by the sum of the individual water surface signals from the CaF2/water and water/graphene interfaces until the confinement reduces to angstrom-scale (&lt; ~8 {\AA}). Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm our experimental observation. These results manifest that interfacial, rather than nanoconfinement effects, dominate the water structure until angstrom-level confinement.</description>

      <title>The role of anharmonicity in single-molecule spin-crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the system-bath paradigm to investigate anharmonicity effects of vibrations on spin-crossover (SCO) in a single molecule. Focusing on weak coupling, we use the linear response approximation to deal with the vibrational bath and propagate the Redfield master equation to obtain the equilibrium high spin fraction. We take both the anharmonicity in the bath potentials and the nonlinearity in the spin-vibration coupling into account and find a strong interplay between these two effects. Further, we show that the SCO in a single molecule is always a gradual transition and the anharmonicity-induced phonon drag greatly affects the transition behavior.</description>

      <title>Single vibronic level fluorescence spectra from Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence experiments, the electronically excited initial state is also excited in one or several vibrational modes. Whereas computing all contributing Franck-Condon factors individually becomes impractical in large systems, a time-dependent formalism has not been applied to simulate emission from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. Here, we use Hagedorn functions, which are products of a Gaussian and carefully generated polynomials, to represent SVL initial states. In systems where the potential is at most quadratic, the Hagedorn functions are exact solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation and can be propagated with the same equations of motion as a simple Gaussian wavepacket. Having developed an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the overlaps between two Hagedorn wavepackets, we can now evaluate emission spectra from arbitrary vibronic levels using a single trajectory. We validate the method in two-dimensional global harmonic models by comparing it with quantum split-operator calculations. Additionally, we study the effects of displacement, distortion (squeezing), and Duschinsky rotation on SVL spectra. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the Hagedorn approach to high-dimensional systems on an example of displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic model with 100 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Coupled cluster theory for nonadiabatic dynamics: nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic couplings in similarity constrained coupled cluster theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory is one of the most accurate electronic structure methods for predicting ground and excited state chemistry. However, the presence of numerical artifacts at electronic degeneracies, such as complex energies, has made it difficult to apply it in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. While it has already been shown that such numerical artifacts can be fully removed by using similarity constrained coupled cluster (SCC) theory [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2017, 8, 19, 4801-4807], simulating dynamics requires efficient implementations of gradients and nonadiabatic couplings. Here, we present an implementation of nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic derivative couplings at the similarity constrained coupled cluster singles and doubles (SCCSD) level of theory, thereby making possible nonadiabatic dynamics simulations using a coupled cluster theory that provides a correct description of conical intersections between excited states. We present a few numerical examples that show good agreement with literature values and discuss some limitations of the method.</description>

      <title>Information gain at the onset of habituation to repeated stimuli</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. Here, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details to show that habituation is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. Crucially, an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in the information that the system collects on the external input over time. We find that the region characterized both by maximal information gain and by the onset of habituation can be retrieved if the system tunes its parameters to minimize dissipation and maximize information at the same time. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the core mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems, elucidating its information-theoretic and functional role.</description>

      <title>Rotational-state dependence of interactions between polar molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05958v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Scheme for Deterministic Loading of Laser-Cooled Molecules into Optical Tweezers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06028v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers, and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an 80% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscopy enables detailed visualization and understanding of minute structures or processes. While cameras have significantly advanced optical, infrared, and electron microscopy, imaging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals on a camera has remained elusive. Here, we employ nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a quantum sensor, which converts NMR signals into optical signals that are subsequently captured by a high-speed camera. Unlike traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), our method records the NMR signal over a wide field of view in real space. We demonstrate that our optical widefield NMR microscopy (OMRM) can image NMR signals in microfluidic structures with a $\sim 10\,\mu m$ resolution across a $\sim 235 \times 150\,\mu m^2$ area. Crucially, each camera pixel records an NMR spectrum providing multicomponent information about the signal's amplitude, phase, local magnetic field strengths, and gradients. The fusion of optical microscopy and NMR techniques enables multifaceted imaging applications in the physical and life sciences.</description>
