      <title>On the Oscillations in Cournot Games with Best Response Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model, which involves multiple firms producing homogeneous products. To explore the oscillation under the updates of best response strategies, we focus on the linear price functions. In this setting, we establish the existence of oscillations. In particular, we show that for the scenario of different costs among firms, the best response converges to either a unique equilibrium or a two-period oscillation. We further characterize the oscillations and propose linear-time algorithms for finding all types of two-period oscillations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first step toward fully analyzing the periodic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of von Neumann's Reduction from the Assignment Problem to Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equivalence between von Neumann's Minimax Theorem for zero-sum games and the LP Duality Theorem connects cornerstone problems of the two fields of game theory and optimization, respectively, and has been the subject of intense scrutiny for seven decades. Yet, as observed in this paper, the proof of the difficult direction of this equivalence is unsatisfactory: It does not assign distinct roles to the two players of the game, as is natural from the definition of a zero-sum game.
  In retrospect, a partial resolution to this predicament was provided in another brilliant paper of von Neumann (1953), which reduced the assignment problem to zero-sum games. However, the underlying LP is highly specialized; all entries of its objective function vector are strictly positive and all entries of the constraint matrix and right hand side vector are equal to one.
  We generalize von Neumann's result along two directions, each allowing negative entries in certain parts of the LP. Our reductions make explicit the roles of the two players of the reduced game, namely their maximin strategies are to play optimal solutions to the primal and dual LPs. Furthermore, unlike previous reductions, the value of the reduced game reveals the value of the given LP. Our generalizations encompass several basic economic scenarios.
  We end by discussing evidence that von Neumann possessed an understanding of the notion of polynomial-time solvability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Competition for Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies information transmission from multiple senders who compete for the attention of a decision maker. Each sender is partially informed about the state of the world and decides how to reveal her information over time to maximise attention. A decision maker wants to learn about the state but faces an attention cost. We derive a condition on the informational environment and the decision problem that guarantees that all information from the senders can be transmitted to the decision maker in equilibrium. A simple class of information processes implements full transmission across general environments. The attention each sender receives is proportional to the residual value of her information. In the case of conditionally iid-informed senders, in the limit as the number of senders grows large, the receiver learns the state exactly and immediately (at no attention cost).</description>

      <title>Information Design with Unknown Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical information design models (e.g., Bayesian persuasion and cheap talk) require players to have perfect knowledge of the prior distribution of the state of the world. Our paper studies repeated persuasion problems in which the information designer does not know the prior. The information designer learns to design signaling schemes from repeated interactions with the receiver. We design learning algorithms for the information designer to achieve no regret compared to using the optimal signaling scheme with known prior, under two models of the receiver's decision-making. (1) The first model assumes that the receiver knows the prior and can perform posterior update and best respond to signals. In this model, we design a learning algorithm for the information designer with $O(\log T)$ regret in the general case, and another algorithm with $\Theta(\log \log T)$ regret in the case where the receiver has only two actions. (2) The second model assumes that the receiver does not know the prior and employs a no-regret learning algorithm to take actions. We show that the information designer can achieve regret $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{rReg}(T) T})$, where $\mathrm{rReg}(T)=o(T)$ is an upper bound on the receiver's learning regret. Our work thus provides a learning foundation for the problem of information design with unknown prior.</description>

      <title>Congestion and Penalization in Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce two novel models derived from the discrete optimal transport problem. The first model extends the traditional transport problem by adding a quadratic congestion factor directly into the cost function, while the second model replaces conventional constraints with weighted penalization terms. We present theoretical results, for the characterization of interior and corner solution for some specific cases, and we perform smooth comparative statics analysis. We also propose an $O((N+L)(NL)^2)$ algorithm for computing the optimal plan for the penalized model.</description>
