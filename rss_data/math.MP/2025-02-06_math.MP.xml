      <title>Three topological phases of the elliptic Ginibre ensembles with a point charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the complex and symplectic elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $(c+1)N \times (c+1)N$, conditioned to have a deterministic eigenvalue at $ p \in \mathbb{R} $ with multiplicity $ c N $. We show that their limiting spectrum is either simply connected, doubly connected, or composed of two disjoint simply connected components. Moreover, denoting by $\tau \in [0,1]$ the non-Hermiticity parameter, we explicitly characterise the regions in the parameter space $ (p, c, \tau) $ where each topological type emerges. For cases where the droplet is either simply or doubly connected, we provide an explicit description of the limiting spectrum and the corresponding electrostatic energies. As an application, we derive the asymptotic behaviour of the moments of the characteristic polynomial for elliptic Ginibre matrices in the exponentially varying regime.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds and the Thouless conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \le 3$, vanishing Chern classes characterize the topological phases of periodic media that exhibit localized Wannier functions. However, for special symmetries $I$ of the system, such as $C_{2z}T$ (space-time reversal), the existence of a localized set of Wannier functions that is also invariant under this symmetry $I$ may not always exist. In systems with fragile topology, Wannier functions cannot respect both the symmetry $I$ and the localization constraints. Nevertheless, this obstruction can be lifted by adding Chern-trivial line bundles, invariant under the $I$-symmetry. This allows for the construction of localized Wannier functions that respect symmetry. In the last section, we take on a broader perspective and obtain Wannier localization in dimensions $d=2,3$ without symmetry constraints for Chern nontrivial Bloch bundles. For $d=2$, we obtain the Wannier decay with Thouless exponent $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$; for $d=3$, we obtain the decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.</description>

      <title>The photography transforms and their analytic inversion formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light field reconstruction from the focal stack can be mathematically formulated as an ill-posed integral equation inversion problem. Although the previous research about this problem has made progress both in practice and theory, its forward problem and inversion in a general form still need to be studied. In this paper, to model the forward problem rigorously, we propose three types of photography transforms with different integral geometry characteristics that extend the forward operator to the arbitrary $n$-dimensional case. We prove that these photography transforms are equivalent to the Radon transform with the coupling relation between variables. We also obtain some properties of the photography transforms, including the Fourier slice theorem, the convolution theorem, and the convolution property of the dual operator, which are very similar to those of the classic Radon transform. Furthermore, the representation of the normal operator and the analytic inversion formula for the photography transforms are derived and they are quite different from those of the classic Radon transform.</description>

      <title>The study of the energy spectrum of a system of quantum micro-vortices in a bounded spatial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on microscopic-sized quantum vortex filaments that are shaped like a circle. The model we considered examines loops with different radii and a small but non-zero core diameter. These loops are located in a bounded domain $D$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortices is based on the new approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal22_1,Tal24_2}. For these loops, we calculate both the quantized circulation and the energy spectrum, which are perfectly non-trivial. To understand how the results we have obtained can be used to describe the initial stage of turbulence in a quantum fluid, we study a system of $K$ random, non-interacting vortices. We explain how specific energy and circulation spectra lead to the occurrence of turbulence in the context of the developed approach.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential-in-volume tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r &gt; vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with torsion and the deformed Shatashvili-Vafa vertex algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct representations of the deformed Shatashvili-Vafa vertex algebra $\mathrm{SV}_a$, with parameter $a \in \mathbb{C}$, as recently proposed in the physics literature by Fiset and Gaberdiel. The geometric input for our construction are integrable $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with closed torsion, solving the heterotic $\mathrm{G}_2$ system with $\alpha'=0$ on the group manifolds $S^3\times T^4$ and $S^3\times S^3\times S^1$. From considerations in string theory, one expects the chiral algebra of these backgrounds to include $\mathrm{SV}_a$, and we provide a mathematical realization of this expectation by obtaining embeddings of $\mathrm{SV}_a$ in the corresponding superaffine vertex algebra and the chiral de Rham complex. In our examples, the parameter $a$ is proportional to the scalar torsion class of the $\mathrm{G}_2$ structure, $a \sim \tau_0$, as expected from previous work in the semi-classical limit by the second author, jointly with De la Ossa and Marchetto.</description>

      <title>Can one hear the shape of a crystal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isospectrality is a general fundamental concept often involving whether various operators can have identical spectra, i.e., the same set of eigenvalues. In the context of the Laplacian operator, the famous question ``Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' concerns whether different shaped drums can have the same vibrational modes. The isospectrality of a lattice in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a tantamount to whether it is uniquely determined by its theta series, i.e., the radial distribution function $g_2(r)$. While much is known about the isospectrality of Bravais lattices across dimensions, little is known about this question of more general crystal (periodic) structures with an $n$-particle basis ($n \ge 2$). Here, we ask, What is $n_{\text{min}}(d)$, the minimum value of $n$ for inequivalent (i.e., unrelated by isometric symmetries) crystals with the same theta function in space dimension $d$? To answer these questions, we use rigorous methods as well as a precise numerical algorithm that enables us to determine the minimum multi-particle basis of inequivalent isospectral crystals. Our algorithm identifies isospectral 4-, 3- and 2-particle bases in one, two and three spatial dimensions, respectively. For many of these isospectral crystals, we rigorously show that they indeed possess identical $g_2(r)$ up to infinite $r$. Based on our analyses, we conjecture that $n_{\text{min}}(d) = 4, 3, 2$ for $d = 1, 2, 3$, respectively. The identification of isospectral crystals enables one to study the degeneracy of the ground-state under the action of isotropic pair potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an algebraic (non-analytic) proof of the deformed boson-fermion Fock space construction of Molev's double supersymmetric Schur functions, among other results, from our previous paper. In other words, we make no assumptions on the variables and parameters. By specializing to a finite number of variables and shifting parameters, we recover the factorial Schur functions. Furthermore, we realize the bosonic construction through a representation of a completion of the infinite rank general linear Lie algebra.</description>

Abstract: The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we present applied mathematics results on the heat content of bounded domains with smooth boundary and with fractal boundary. Second, we discuss new findings and concepts related to fractal curvatures for domains with fractal boundary. We conjecture that fractal curvatures and their scaling exponents will emerge in the short-time heat content asymptotics of domains with fractal boundary.</description>

      <title>On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock theta functions, and false theta functions, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations in order to classify all representations of the Kac-Moody algebras with characters being modular forms. For the Kac-Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$ we calculate the Zagier-Zwegers' polar-finite decomposition for admissible characters with string functions being mock modular coefficients of the finite part. These admissible string functions were realized by Ahn, Chung, and Tye as the characters of the generalized Fateev-Zamolodchikov parafermionic theories. Using our new polar-finite decomposition, we obtain families of mock theta conjecture-like identities parametrized by spin for $1/3$ and $2/3$-level string functions in terms of the Ramanujan's classical mock theta functions $f_3(q)$ and $\omega_3(q)$. We also obtain an analogous family of identities for the $1/5$-level string functions in terms of Ramanujan's four tenth-order mock theta functions. Finally, we give a heuristic argument for a refined expansion of the general positive admissible-level string function in terms of Appell functions.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of soliton-based frequency combs in the Lugiato-Lefever equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kerr frequency combs are optical signals consisting of a multitude of equally spaced excited modes in frequency space. They are generated by converting a continuous-wave pump laser within an optical microresonator. It has been observed that the interplay of Kerr nonlinearity and dispersion in the microresonator can lead to a stable optical signal consisting of a periodic sequence of highly localized ultra-short pulses, resulting in broad frequency spectrum. The discovery that stable broadband frequency combs can be generated in microresonators has unlocked a wide range of promising applications, particularly in optical communications, spectroscopy and frequency metrology. In its simplest form, the physics in the microresonator is modeled by the Lugiato-Lefever equation, a damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with forcing. In this paper we demonstrate that the Lugiato-Lefever equation indeed supports arbitrarily broad Kerr frequency combs by proving the existence and stability of periodic solutions consisting of any number of well-separated, strongly localized and highly nonlinear pulses on a single periodicity interval. We realize these periodic multiple pulse solutions as concatenations of individual bright cavity solitons by phrasing the problem as a reversible dynamical system and employing results from homoclinic bifurcation theory. The spatial dynamics formulation enables us to harness general results, based on Evans-function techniques and Lin's method, to rigorously establish diffusive spectral stability. This, in turn, yields nonlinear stability of the periodic multipulse solutions against localized and subharmonic perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of elementary particle physics is one of the most successful models of contemporary theoretical physics being in full agreement with experiments. However, its mathematical structure deserves further investigations both from a geometric and an analytic point of view. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a mathematically well-defined and self-contained description of the Standard Model in terms of gauge theory and differential geometry on globally hyperbolic manifolds. Within this setup we then prove the existence of a global solution for the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Standard Model (with the conformal Higgs potential) under the assumptions that the globally hyperbolic manifold is a four-dimensional spacetime of expanding type and small initial data. This is achieved by establishing a gauge-invariant energy estimate which is of independent mathematical interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of the CCDM (creation of cold dark matter) cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates ranging from constant to dynamical, we examine the nature of critical points and their stability obtained from the individual scenario consisting of only cold dark matter, or cold dark matter plus a second fluid with constant equation of state. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict unstable dark matter dominated critical points, stable accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, scaling attractors in which both dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. Along with these critical points, these scenarios also indicate the possibility of decelerating attractors or decelerating scaling attractors in the future which are new results in this direction. These altogether suggest that CCDM cosmologies are viable alternatives to the mainstream cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of the Hat and Spectre tilings and some of their relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffraction spectra of the Hat and Spectre monotile tilings, which are known to be pure point, are derived and computed explicitly. This is done via model set representatives of self-similar members in the topological conjugacy classes of the Hat and the Spectre tiling, which are the CAP and the CASPr tiling, respectively. This is followed by suitable reprojections of the model sets to represent the original Hat and Spectre tilings, which also allows to calculate their Fourier--Bohr coefficients explicitly. Since the windows of the underlying model sets have fractal boundaries, these coefficients need to be computed via an exact renormalisation cocycle in internal space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for high-precision numerical evaluations of Lauricella functions, whose indices are linearly dependent on some parameter $\varepsilon$, in terms of their Laurent series expansions at zero. This method is based on finding analytic continuations of these functions in terms of Frobenius generalized power series. Being one-dimensional, these series are much more suited for high-precision numerical evaluations than multi-dimensional sums arising in approaches to analytic continuations based on re-expansions of hypergeometric series or Mellin--Barnes integral representations. To accelerate the calculation procedure further, the $\varepsilon$ dependence of the result is reconstructed from the evaluations of given Lauricella functions at specific numerical values of $\varepsilon$, which, in addition, allows for efficient parallel implementation. The method has been implemented in the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package, written in Wolfram Mathematica language.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems and K\"ahler Duality of Complex Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is split up into two parts: The first one concerns (pseudo)-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems, while the second part is about K\"ahler structures of complex coadjoint orbits. We begin the first part by investigating basic properties of holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (HHSs) like maximal holomorphic trajectories and holomorphic Hamiltonian foliations. Afterwards, we use these notions to combine HHSs with two structures frequently studied in geometry, namely Lefschetz and almost toric fibrations, leading us to the notion of a holomorphic symplectic Lefschetz fibration. Following this examination, we formulate action functionals for HHSs. These action functionals are well-suited to find periodic orbits. However, it turns out that HHSs rarely exhibit periodic orbits. One possible obstruction for a HHS to possess periodic orbits is the integrability of the underlying complex structure. To circumvent this obstruction, we introduce the notion of pseudo-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (PHHSs) which allow us to describe classical mechanics on almost complex manifolds. We show that PHHSs satisfy almost the same properties as HHSs. In the second part, we study coadjoint orbits of complex Lie groups and show that they also exhibit, next to their Hyperk\"ahler structure which was introduced by Kronheimer and Kovalev in the 90s, a holomorphic K\"ahler structure. A holomorphic K\"ahler structure can be thought of as a complexification of a usual K\"ahler structure. We call the fact that a space admits both Hyperk\"ahler and holomorphic K\"ahler structures ''K\"ahler duality''. In this thesis, we suspect that the K\"ahler duality of complex coadjoint orbits can be traced back to double cotangent bundles. Precisely speaking, we conjecture that double cotangent bundles naturally exhibit K\"ahler duality and that this K\"ahler duality transfers via reduction to complex coadjoint orbits.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative Einstein-Maxwell equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\phi$ Drinfeld twist and solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the noncommutative parameter $a$. The equation of motion, the NC Einstein-Maxwell equation, turns out to be effectively a problem in nonlinear electrodynamics where the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ obtains correction terms with three Faraday tensors $F_{\mu\nu}$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole modified with nonzero $g_{t\theta}, g_{r\phi}, g_{tr}$ and $g_{\phi\theta}$ components proportional to $a$, while the electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr-Newman potential which introduces a nonzero $A_{\theta}$ term proportional to $a$.</description>

      <title>Construction of Nontrivial Quantum Gauge Theories: The Continuum limit in a Finite Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.05981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct several quantum gauge theories in 4 dimensional space time, including both Abelian and non Abelian gauge groups, with the Abelian gauge fields coupled to zero mass matter fields. The construction occurs in a fixed finite Euclidean spatial domain. The construction begins with the doubly cutoff bare field theory (with a finite space time volume and a mesh based ultraviolet cutoff) constructed in a separate paper.
  We use a limited range of renormalized perturbation theory, just sufficient to cancel all the divergences. We demonstrate convergence of the ultraviolet limit and of the renormalized perturbation theory, when summed to all orders. We construct the fully renormalized Lagrangian and Schwinger functions.</description>

      <title>Graded Poisson and Graded Dirac structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been several attempts in recent years to extend the notions of symplectic and Poisson structures in order to create a suitable geometrical framework for classical field theories, trying to achieve a success similar to the use of these concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics. These notions always have a graded character, since the multisymplectic forms are of a higher degree than two. Another line of work has been to extend the concept of Dirac structures to these new scenarios. In the present paper we review all these notions, relate them and propose and study a generalization that (under some mild regularity conditions) includes them and is of graded nature. We expect this generalization to allow us to advance in the study of classical field theories, their integrability, reduction, numerical approximations and even their quantization.</description>

      <title>Self-switching random walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs feel the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs in which, every time the random walk returns to the starting point, first an edge probability is independently sampled according to a priori measure $\mu$, and then an Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph is sampled according to that edge probability. When the edge probability $p$ does not depend on the size of the graph $n$ (dense case), we show that the proportion of time the random walk spends on different values of $p$ -- {\it occupation measure} -- converges to the a priori measure $\mu$ as $n$ goes to infinity. More interestingly, when $p=\lambda/n$ (sparse case), we show that the occupation measure converges to a limiting measure with a density that is a function of the survival probability of a Poisson branching process. This limiting measure is supported on the supercritial values for the Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, showing that self-witching random walks can detect the phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a $*$-automorphism group $G$ on a $C^*$- or von Neumann algebra, we study the $G$-quasi invariant states and their properties. The $G$-quasi invariance or $G$-strongly quasi invariance are weaker than the $G$-invariance and have wide applications. We develop several properties for $G$-strongly quasi invariant states. Many of them are the extensions of the already developed theories for $G$-invariant states. Among others, we consider the relationship between the group $G$ and modular automorphism group, invariant subalgebras, ergodicity, modular theory, and abelian subalgebras. We provide with some examples to support the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the martingales in relevance with $G$-strongly quasi-invariant states on a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$, where $G$ is a separable locally compact group of $*$-automorphisms of $\mathcal A$. In the von Neumann algebra $\mathfrak A$ of the GNS representation, we define a unitary representation of the group and define a group $\hat G$ of $*$-automorphisms of $\mathfrak A$, which is homomorphic to $G$. For the case of compact $G$, under some mild condition, we find a $\hat G$-invariant state on $\mathfrak A$ and define a conditional expectation with range the $\hat G$-fixed subalgebra. Moving to the separable locally compact group $G=\cup_NG_N$, which is the union of increasing compact groups, we construct a sequence of conditional expectations and thereby construct (decreasing) martingales, which have limits by the martingale convergence theorem. We provide with an example for the group of finite permutations on the set of nonnegative integers acting on a $C^*$-algebra of infinite tensor product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a simple variational model describing the ground state of a superconducting charge qubit. The model gives rise to a shape optimization problem that aims at maximizing the number of qubit states at a given gating voltage. We show that for small values of the charge optimal shapes exist and are $C^{2,\alpha}$-nearly spherical sets. In contrast, we prove that balls are not minimizers for large values of the charge and conjecture that optimal shapes do not exist, with the energy favoring disjoint collections of sets.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of split type) in current generators and relations, via a degeneration of the Drinfeld presentation of affine $\imath$quantum groups (associated with split Satake diagrams). These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras; presentations for twisted current algebras are also provided. For type AI, it matches with the Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangian obtained via Gauss decomposition. We conjecture that our split twisted Yangians are isomorphic to the corresponding ones in RTT presentation.</description>

      <title>Foundations on k-contact geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: k-Contact geometry is a generalisation of contact geometry to analyse field theories. We develop an approach to k-contact geometry based on distributions that are distributionally maximally non-integrable and admit, locally, k commuting supplementary Lie symmetries: the k-contact distributions. We related k-contact distributions with Engel, Goursat and other distributions, which have mathematical and physical interest. We give necessary topological conditions for the existence of globally defined Lie symmetries, k-contact Lie groups are defined and studied, and we study and propose a k-contact Weinstein conjecture for co-oriented k-contact manifolds. Polarisations for k-contact distributions are introduced and it is shown that a polarised k-contact distribution is locally diffeomorphic to the Cartan distribution of the first-order jet bundle over a fibre bundle of order k. We relate k-contact manifolds to presymplectic and k-symplectic manifolds on fibre bundles of larger dimension and define types of submanifolds in k-contact geometry. We study Hamilton-De Donder-Weyl equations in Lie groups for the first time. A theory of k-contact Hamiltonian vector fields is developed, and we describe characteristics of Lie symmetries for first-order partial differential equations in a k-contact Hamiltonian manner. We use our techniques to analyse Hamilton-Jacobi and Dirac equations. Other potential applications of k-contact distributions to non-holonomic and control systems are briefly described.</description>

Abstract: We explore the meromorphic structure of the $\zeta$-function associated to the boundary eigenvalue problem of a modified Sturm-Liouville operator subject to spectral dependent boundary conditions at one end of a segment of length $l$. We find that it presents isolated simple poles which follow the general rule valid for second order differential operators subject to standard local boundary conditions. We employ our results to evaluate the determinant of the operator and the Casimir energy of the system it describes, and study its dependence on $l$ for both the massive and the massless cases.</description>

      <title>The Confluent Heun functions in Black Hole Perturbation Theory: a spacetime interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides a spacetime interpretation of the confluent Heun functions within black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) and explores their relationship to the hyperboloidal framework. In BHPT, the confluent Heun functions are solutions to the radial Teukolsky equation, but they are traditionally studied without an explicit reference to the underlying spacetime geometry. Here, we show that the distinct behaviour of these functions near their singular points reflects the structure of key surfaces in black hole spacetimes. By interpreting homotopic transformations of the confluent Heun functions as changes in the spacetime foliation, we connect these solutions to different regions of the black hole's global structure, such as the past and future event horizons, past and future null infinity, spatial infinity, and even past and future timelike infinity. We also discuss the relationship between the confluent Heun functions and the hyperboloidal formulation of the Teukolsky equation. Although neither confluent Heun form of the radial Teukolsky equation can be interpreted as hyperboloidal slices, this approach offers new insights into wave propagation and scattering from a global black hole spacetime perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Hawking's singularity theorem for spacetime metrics of local Lipschitz regularity. The proof rests on (1) new estimates for the Ricci curvature of regularising smooth metrics that are based upon a quite general Friedrichs-type lemma and (2) the replacement of the usual focusing techniques for timelike geodesics -- which in the absence of a classical ODE-theory for the initial value problem are no longer available -- by a worldvolume estimate based on a segment-type inequality that allows one to control the volume of the set of points in a spacelike surface that possess long maximisers.</description>
