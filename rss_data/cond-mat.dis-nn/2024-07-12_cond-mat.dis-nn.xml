      <title>Chaotic synchronization in adaptive networks of pulse-coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembles of phase-oscillators are known to exhibit a variety of collective regimes. Here, we show that a simple mean-field model involving two heterogenous populations of pulse-coupled oscillators, exhibits, in the strong-coupling limit, a robust irregular macroscopic dynamics. The resulting, strongly synchronized, regime is sustained by a homeostatic mechanism induced by the shape of the phase-response curve combined with adaptive coupling strength, included to account for energy dissipated by the pulse emission. The proposed setup mimicks a neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</description>

      <title>Topology of ultra-localized insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of an insulator can be defined even when all eigenstates of the system are localized - an extreme case of Anderson insulators that we call ultra-localized. We derive the classification of such ultra-localized insulators in all symmetry classes and dimensions. We clarify their bulk-boundary correspondence and show that ultra-localized systems are in many instances phases of matter not described by the known classification of topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics and long-range order in thermal neuristor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of scalable and energy-efficient neuromorphic devices, recent research has unveiled a novel category of spiking oscillators, termed "thermal neuristors." These devices function via thermal interactions among neighboring vanadium dioxide resistive memories, emulating biological neuronal behavior. Here, we show that the collective dynamical behavior of networks of these neurons showcases a rich phase structure, tunable by adjusting the thermal coupling and input voltage. Notably, we identify phases exhibiting long-range order that, however, does not arise from criticality, but rather from the time non-local response of the system. In addition, we show that these thermal neuristor arrays achieve high accuracy in image recognition and time series prediction through reservoir computing, without leveraging long-range order. Our findings highlight a crucial aspect of neuromorphic computing with possible implications on the functioning of the brain: criticality may not be necessary for the efficient performance of neuromorphic systems in certain computational tasks.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Monte Carlo algorithms for hard disk glasses: from event-chain to collective swaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium sampling of the configuration space in disordered systems requires algorithms that bypass the glassy slowing down of the physical dynamics. Irreversible Monte Carlo algorithms breaking detailed balance successfully accelerate sampling in some systems. We first implement an irreversible event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a model of polydisperse hard disks. The effect of collective translational moves marginally affects the dynamics and results in a modest speedup that decreases with density. We then propose an irreversible algorithm performing collective particle swaps which outperforms all known Monte Carlo algorithms. We show that these collective swaps can also be used to prepare very dense jammed packings of disks.</description>

      <title>Modulating Relaxation Time in Boundary-Dissipative Systems via Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Link to Densify: Topological Transitions and Origin of Hysteresis During the (De)Compression of Amorphous Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter we study the phase transition between amorphous ices and the nature of the hysteresis cycle separating them. We discover that a topological transition takes place as the system transforms from low-density amorphous ice (LDA) at low pressures, to high-density amorphous ice (HDA) at high pressures. Specifically, we uncover that the hydrogen bond network (HBN) displays qualitatively different topologies in the LDA and HDA phases: the former characterised by disentangled loop motifs, while the latter displaying topologically complex and metastable Hopf-linked and knotted configurations. At the phase transition, the transient opening of the HBN topological motifs yields mechanical fragility on the macroscale. Our results provide a detailed microscopic description of the topological nature of the phase transition and the hysteresis cycle between amorphous ices. We argue that the topological transition discovered in this work may not only improve our understanding of amorphous ices but represent a generic mechanism for the densification of network-forming materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic scale of quantum phase transitions: from doped semiconductors to spin chains, cold gases and moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions (QPTs), quantum systems become scale-invariant and can be grouped into universality classes characterized by sets of critical exponents. We have found that despite scale-invariance and universality, the experimental data still contain information related to the microscopic processes and scales governing QPTs. We have found that for many systems, the scaled data near QPTs can be approximated by the generic exponential dependence introduced in the scaling theory of localization; this dependence includes as a parameter a microscopic seeding scale of the renormalization group, $L_0$. We have also conjectured that for interacting systems, the temperature cuts the renormalization group flow at the length travelled by a system-specific elementary excitation over the life-time set by the Planckian time, $\tau_P$=$\hbar/k_BT$. We have adapted this approach for QPTs in several systems and showed that $L_0$ extracted from experiment is comparable to physically-expected minimal length scales, namely (i) the mean free path for metal-insulator transition in doped semiconductor Si:B, (ii) the distance between spins in Heisenberg and Ising chains, (iii) the period of an optical lattice for cold atom boson gases, and (iv) the period of a moir\'e superlattice for the Mott QPT in dichalcogenide bilayers. The metal-insulator transition in Si:P has been explained using a non-interacting version of the model. In two companion papers, we show that in superconducting systems, $L_0$ is comparable to superconducting coherence length, and in quantum Hall systems, to the magnetic length. The developed new method of data analysis identifies microscopic processes leading to QPTs and quantitatively explains and unifies a large body of experimental data.</description>

      <title>NCoder -- A Quantum Field Theory approach to encoding data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to interpretable AI inspired by Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which we call the NCoder. The NCoder is a modified autoencoder neural network whose latent layer is prescribed to be a subset of $n$-point correlation functions. Regarding images as draws from a lattice field theory, this architecture mimics the task of perturbatively constructing the effective action of the theory order by order in an expansion using Feynman diagrams. Alternatively, the NCoder may be regarded as simulating the procedure of statistical inference whereby high dimensional data is first summarized in terms of several lower dimensional summary statistics (here the $n$-point correlation functions), and subsequent out-of-sample data is generated by inferring the data generating distribution from these statistics. In this way the NCoder suggests a fascinating correspondence between perturbative renormalizability and the sufficiency of models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the NCoder by applying it to the generation of MNIST images, and find that generated images can be correctly classified using only information from the first three $n$-point functions of the image distribution.</description>
