      <title>Unsupervised learning for anticipating critical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For anticipating critical transitions in complex dynamical systems, the recent approach of parameter-driven reservoir computing requires explicit knowledge of the bifurcation parameter. We articulate a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) and reservoir computing to address this challenge. In particular, the driving factor is detected from time series using the VAE in an unsupervised-learning fashion and the extracted information is then used as the parameter input to the reservoir computer for anticipating the critical transition. We demonstrate the power of the unsupervised learning scheme using prototypical dynamical systems including the spatiotemporal Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system. The scheme can also be extended to scenarios where the target system is driven by several independent parameters or with partial state observations.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt Echo for edge of chaos and chaotic sea in Standard Map: Cases Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Standard Map model, this study explores the quantum Loschmidt Echo (LE) decay laws for mixed-type phase spaces, including edge of chaos and chaotic sea regimes. A universal decay law is proposed and numerically verified, characterizing the intricate dynamics of LE decay processes with a semi-classical statistical approach. Key findings include three typical decay stages and time-scale relations as well as the critical perturbations for comparing the decay extent, with critical insights into classical-quantum correspondences through the construction of classical ensemble from the uncertainty of quantum state. This work provides analytical and numerical advancements in understanding dynamical stability in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Contraction and Synchronization in Reservoir Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the conditions under which global contraction manifests in the leaky continuous time reservoirs, thus guaranteeing generalized synchronization. Results on continuous time reservoirs make use of the logarithmic norm of the connectivity matrix. Further analysis yields some simple guidelines on how to better construct the connectivity matrix in these systems. Additionally, we outline how the universal approximation property of discrete time reservoirs is readily satisfied by virtue of the activation function being contracting, and how continuous time reservoirs may inherit a limited form of universal approximation due to their overlap with neural ordinary differential equations. The ability of the reservoir computing framework to universally approximate topological conjugates, along with their fast training, make them a compelling data-driven, black-box surrogate of dynamical systems, and a potential candidate for a component of digital twins.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant effects in pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pilot-wave hydrodynamics concerns the dynamics of 'walkers,' droplets walking on a vibrating bath, and has provided the basis for the burgeoning field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We here explore a theoretical model of pilot-wave hydrodynamics that relaxes the simplifying assumption of resonance between the droplet and its pilot wave, specifically the assumption of a fixed impact phase between the bouncing drop and its wave field. The model captures both the vertical and horizontal dynamics of the drop, allowing one to examine non-resonant effects for both free and constrained walkers. The model provides new rationale for a number of previously reported but poorly understood features of free walker motion in pilot-wave hydrodynamics, including colinear swaying at the onset of motion, intermittent walking, and chaotic speed oscillations, all of which are accompanied by sporadic changes in the impact phase of the bouncing drop. The model also highlights the degeneracy in the droplets' vertical dynamics, specifically, the possibility of two distinct bouncing phases and of switching between the two. Consideration of this degeneracy is critical to understanding the droplet dynamics and statistics emerging in confined geometries at high memory and the interaction of walking droplets with standing Faraday waves.</description>
