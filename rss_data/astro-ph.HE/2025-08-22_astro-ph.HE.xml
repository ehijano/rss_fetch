      <title>Correlating Particle Acceleration Rates with Plasma Conditions in Colliding Wind Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed star-forming regions as possible origin sites of very-high-energy (TeV) cosmic rays, not associated with supernova remnants. Colliding-wind binaries (CWBs) are strong X-ray and radio synchrotron emitters and have been proposed as potential accelerators of such particles. We perform high-resolution three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations coupled with test-particle integration to investigate how local plasma conditions affect particle acceleration in CWBs. We find that the maximum particle energies and the hardness of the energy distributions depend on the shock magnetization and cooling efficiency. For moderate magnetization ($\gt$1 G), CWBs can accelerate hadronic particles up to hundreds of TeV or even PeV energies, with more than 1\% of particles reaching the very-high-energy range. By correlating the local acceleration rate with plasma quantities - \textit{magnetic field strength, current density, vorticity, and velocity divergence} - we show that turbulence and magnetic field complexity dominate the acceleration, while classical diffusive shock acceleration plays a limited role. These results suggest that turbulent, magnetically driven processes are key to producing relativistic particles in CWBs, with implications for future high sensitivity $\gamma$-ray observations (e.g. LACT and CTAO).</description>

      <title>A pseudo-Newtonian stationary circumbinary slim disk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pseudo-Newtonian stationary circumbinary slim disk model. We extend the slim disk formalism by including the binary tidal torque and solve the resulting steady-state equations to determine the circumbinary disk structure. We compare the binary slim disk solutions with corresponding binary thin disk solutions, calculate the disk spectrum, explore the impact of different parameters on the system, and estimate the binary shrinkage timescale. We find that; (1) due to the different disk density profiles, the integrated tidal torque exerted on the disk is significantly smaller for the slim disk than for the thin disk; as a result thin disks onto binary black holes can be radiatively significantly more efficient than slim disks; (2) The presence of the secondary alters the emission of the circumbinary disk, making it different from the spectrum of a single black hole Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN); (3) The tidal torque boosts the viscous torque in the outer part of the disk (radii greater than the binary separation), which is strongly dependent on the disk parameters, including the binary mass ratio $q$, the orbital separation $a$, the viscous parameter $\alpha$ and the accretion rate $\dot M$; (4) The vertical component of the potential of the secondary slightly decreases the integrated tidal torque. However, both the vertical and radial components of the potential of the secondary have small impact on the disk radiative flux; (5) Using the integrated disk tidal torque backreacting on the secondary at different orbital separations, we find that the disk provides an efficient way to shrink the binary orbital separation.</description>

      <title>Verification of Cas A neutron star cooling rate using Chandra HRC-S observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young neutron star (NS) in the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant is a fascinating test for theories of NS cooling. Chandra observations have indicated that its surface temperature is declining rapidly, about 2% per decade, using 20 years of data, if a uniform carbon atmosphere is assumed for the NS. This rapid decline may be caused by the neutrons in the NS core transitioning from a normal to a superfluid state. However, most of the Cas A NS observations were performed by the Chandra ACIS detectors, which suffer complicated systematic effects. Here, we test the cooling of the Cas A NS with Chandra HRC data over 25 years. The Chandra HRC detector has independent systematics, serving as a cross-check. Assuming a fixed hydrogen column density ($N_{\rm H}$), we infer the cooling rate of the Cas A NS to be 0.57$^{+0.26}_{-0.27}$% per decade. Allowing the $N_{\rm H}$ to vary with time (as estimated using ACIS data), the cooling rate is 1.11$^{+0.25}_{-0.28}$% per decade. These cooling rates are smaller than measured using ACIS data, implying systematic uncertainties have not been eradicated from either or both datasets. However, we have verified the decline in the absorbed flux from the Cas A NS using an independent instrument, at $&gt;3\sigma$ level (4.7%$\pm$1.5% over 10 years). Additionally, the weaker cooling rate of Cas A NS inferred from HRC datasets eliminates the tension with the theoretically predicted cooling, and can be explained by the reduced efficiency of the neutrino emission accompanying the Cooper pair breaking and formation process in neutron triplet-state superfluid.</description>

      <title>The color evolution of magnetar-powered kilonova emission in merging neutron star-neutron star systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first direct detection of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 and its electromagnetic (EM) counterpart open a new window for studying of multi-messenger astronomy. However, how to identify the remnant of binary neutron star (NS) merger via EM radiation remain an open question. In this paper, we propose a method of color evolution of kilonova emission to identify its progenitors. We assume that the energy of the kilonova is contributed from radioactive decay, magnetar spin-down, and pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The color evolution of kilonova emission associated with short GRB is significant when the spectrum is thermal emission, while it tends towards a constant when the spectrum is non-thermal radiation. On the other hand, if the central engine is a black hole (BH) which is promptly generated by the NS-NS merger or NS-BH merger, then the kilonova is powered only by the radioactive decay. There is no color evolution at the beginning before the peak of kilonova emission, but is significantly and rapidly increasing after the peak. On the contrary, if the central engine is a magnetar or stable NS, the kilonova emission is contributed from radioactive decay, magnetar, and PWN. The color evolution after the peak of kilonova emission is complex behavior which depends on the rotational energy and spin-down time-scale of magnetar, and finally tend to a constant in the late state.</description>

      <title>Single Epoch Measurements of Dispersion Measure Gradients Towards PSR B0834+06</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of pulsar dispersion measures is vital to high precision timing experiments, as well as astrometric experiments to determine pulsar positions and proper motions. In this work, we present a novel approach to measuring dispersion measure gradients using pulsar scintillometry. This approach makes use of the multipath propagation through the interstellar medium to simultaneously probe dispersion measures along multiple sight lines from a single observation. Using existing data of PSR B0834+06, we are able to measure gradients of $9.7\pm0.3\times10^{-6}~\rm{pc}~\rm{cm}^{-3}~\rm{mas}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>$r$-process Heating Feedback on Disk Outflows from Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star mergers produce $r$-process elements, with yields that are sensitive to the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the ejecta. These ejecta properties are potentially affected by dynamically-important feedback from $r$-process heating, which is usually not coupled to the hydrodynamics in post-merger simulations modeling the ejecta launching and expansion. The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed the importance of producing reliable ejecta predictions, to maximize the diagnostic potential of future events. In this paper, we develop a prescription for including $r$-process heating as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations. This prescription depends on local fluid properties and on the $Y_{e}$ history as recorded by dedicated tracer particles, which exchange information with the grid using the Cloud-in-Cell method. The method is implemented in long-term viscous hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk outflows to investigate its feedback on ejecta properties. We find that $r$-process heating can increase the unbound disk ejecta mass by $\sim 10\%$ relative to a baseline case that only considers alpha particle recombination. Nuclear heating also enhances the radial velocity of the ejecta with $Y_e &lt; 0.25$ by up to a factor of two, while concurrently suppressing marginally-bound convective ejecta.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Globular Clusters to Diffuse Gamma-ray Emission from Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission (DGE) provides a valuable probe for investigating the cosmic ray propagation and interactions within our Galactic environment. Recent observations have demonstrated systematic excesses of DGE compared with the conventional cosmic-ray propagation model predictions. While $\gamma$-ray emissions have been detected in a subset of globular clusters, their undetected populations may significantly contribute to the DGE. Motivated by this possibility, we present a comprehensive assessment of potential contributions from unresolved globular clusters to the DGE. In our analysis, a nonparametric method is employed to estimate the luminosity function and spatial distribution function of globular clusters using the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalog (4FGL) combined with a reference globular cluster catalog. Based on these distributions, we calculate the cumulative contribution of unresolved globular cluster populations to the DGE observed by Fermi-LAT and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our results reveal that globular clusters account for only $\sim$2\% of the DGE at the TeV range, and smaller than $1\%$ in the GeV regime, which is effectively negligible.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN Disks: Tracing Massive Black Hole Growth Across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense and gaseous environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can catalyze repeated mergers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), potentially explaining the high-mass tail of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). We present a semi-analytical population synthesis framework that captures key physical processes in AGN disks, including gas capture, migration, binary pair-up, gas hardening, and dynamical binary-single interactions. Our simulations show that AGN disks can produce hierarchical mergers, especially near migration traps, and may contribute to the high-mass, high-spin BBH population. This work opens prospects for constraining both the AGN channel and supermassive black hole growth with future gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations of a Candidate Redback Millisecond Pulsar: 1FGL J0523.5-2529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redback pulsars are a subclass of millisecond pulsar system with a low-mass non-degenerate companion star being ablated by the pulsar. They are of interest due to the insights they can provide for late-stage pulsar evolution during the recycling process. J0523.5-2529 is one such candidate where redback-like emission has been seen at multiple wavelengths except radio. It is a system with a binary orbit of 16.5 hours and a low-mass non-degenerate companion of approximately 0.8 solar masses. The aim of this work was to conduct follow-up radio observations to search for any exhibited radio pulsar emission from J0523.5-2529. This work employs a periodicity and single burst search across 74 percent of the system's orbital phase using a total of 34.5 hours of observations. Observations were carried out using the Murriyang Telescope at Parkes and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Despite extensive orbital phase coverage, no periodic or single-pulse radio emission was detected above a signal-to-noise threshold of 7. A comprehensive search for radio pulsations from J0523.5-2529 using Parkes and GBT yielded no significant emission, likely due to intrinsic faintness, scattering, or eclipses by the companion's outflow. The results demonstrate the elusiveness of the pulsar component in some redback systems and highlight the need for multi-wavelength follow-up and higher-frequency radio observations to constrain the source nature and binary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Direct Solution of the Time-Dependent Covariant Radiative Transfer Equation and its Coupling to General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics with cuHARM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a major update to the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code cuHARM, which adds fully covariant treatment of radiation transport and the subsequent radiation backreaction on the dynamics of the fluid. For the radiative calculations, we discretize and solve the radiation transfer equation on a geodesic grid, in order to resolve the angular distribution of the radiation field everywhere in space. This allows for detailed treatment of non-isotropic radiation fields, which is crucial for accurately resolving regions of intermediate optical depth. We present the equations solved, the numerical methods used, and standard tests used to verify the different aspects of a radiation hydrodynamics code, in particular radiation transport and radiation-fluid interaction. We present an application of the code to the case of black hole radiative accretion. This new radiation module is fully GPU-accelerated and represents a major advance in the capabilities of cuHARM.</description>

      <title>Long-term simultaneous 2.25/8.60~GHz monitoring of the newly-discovered repeating FRB~20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the simultaneous monitoring of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 20240114A at 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, conducted 66 times between 2024 January 29 and 2025 February 15 with the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT). In about 180 hours of observation, we detected 155 bursts at 2.25~GHz above a fluence threshold of 0.72~Jy~ms, but none at 8.60~GHz above a fluence threshold of 0.27~Jy~ms. FRB~20240114A exhibited frequency-dependent activity, as evidenced by the non-detections in 14.3 hours of observations at 2.25~GHz prior to 2024 February 24, despite its reported activity below 2~GHz. In contrast to its low-activity state reported below 1.4~GHz between 2024 June and December, FRB~20240114A exhibited high activity at 2.25~GHz in 2024 July with a mean burst rate of $1.72^{+0.18}_{-0.16}~\rm{hr}^{-1}$, followed by a low-activity state. We also detected a short-term reactivation at 2.25~GHz around 2025 January 20, about two weeks after renewed activity was reported below 1.4~GHz by other telescopes. The median burst width at 2.25~GHz is 3~ms, which is narrower than that at lower frequencies. The waiting time distribution peaks at 1019~s, and burst arrivals on hourly timescales consistent with a Poisson process. The isotropic-equivalent energy of bursts spans $10^{37} -10^{39}$~erg. The distribution of burst energy above the completeness threshold ($7.5\times10^{37}$~erg) follows a power-law relation with an index of $\gamma=-1.20\pm0.03\pm0.02$. Finally, we find that FRB~20240114A is at least two orders of magnitude less active at 8.60~GHz than at 2.25~GHz, and we constrain the broadband spectra of the detected bursts.</description>

      <title>Formation of heavy double neutron stars I: Eddington-limited accretion for a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star at solar metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 30 Galactic double neutron star (DNS) binaries have now been identified through radio pulsar timing. The 24 DNSs in the Galactic field with measured total masses lie in the narrow range of 2.3--2.9 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, gravitational-wave observations have detected two DNS mergers: GW170817, with a total mass of 2.7 $M_{\odot}$, and GW190425, with a significantly higher mass of 3.4 $M_{\odot}$. The unusually high mass of GW190425 suggests a non-standard formation channel not represented in the known Galactic population. To investigate the origin of such a massive DNS system, we model the late evolutionary stages of helium stars with initial masses between 2.5 and 9.8 $M_{\odot}$ in binaries with 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star companions, using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA at solar metallicity. We test alternative formation pathways and calibrate our models to reproduce the observed Galactic DNS mass and orbital distributions. By incorporating a modified natal kick prescription, our population synthesis results are broadly consistent with the observed total mass distribution of known DNS systems. Only a small fraction of DNSs of our model have total masses $\geq$ 3 $M_{\odot}$, insufficient to explain the high rate of massive DNS mergers inferred from GW observations. However, our model rules out the formation of heavy DNS systems like GW190425 via the second unstable mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Main and interpulse interaction in PSRs J1842+0358 and J1926+0737: evidence for interpole communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the elusive radio-pulsar emission mechanism would be deepened by determining the locality of the emission. Pulsars in which the two poles interact can potentially help solve this challenge. We here report the discovery of interaction of emission between the main and the interpulse in two pulsars -- J1842+0358 and J1926+0737, based on FAST and MeerKAT data. When emission is bright in one pulse, it is dim in the other. Even when split in just 2 groups (strong versus weak) the anti-correlated brightness can change by a factor $\gtrsim$2. Both sources furthermore show the same quasi-periodic modulation from the main and interpulse, at timescales exceeding 100 pulse periods. The longitude stationary modulation from at least one pulse suggests that it is a key signature for interpulse pulsars showing main and interpulse interaction. If the interaction happens within an isolated magnetosphere, without external influences, either communication between the opposite poles is required, or global changes drive both. This detailed study of these two sources was only made possible by improved sensitivity. The fact that both show two-pole modulation strongly suggests this is a general phenomenon in interpulse pulsars. In regular pulsars only one pole is visible, and a number of these show correlated changes between the profile and spin-down rate, that are also thought to be caused by global magnetospheric changes.

      <title>Robustness of Solutions of the Quantum Kinetic Equations in the Presence of Matter Density Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of fluctuations in the matter density on neutrino flavor evolution by studying their effects on the collision terms in the spherically symmetric quantum kinetics equations (QKEs). We solve the QKEs with varying radial resolution ($r_{\mathrm{bins}} = 150 \, , 1500 \, , 15000$) to assess numerical convergence in angular distributions, number densities, and energy spectra for four neutrino flavors ($\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$, $\nu_x$, $\bar{\nu}_x$). Our results demonstrate that the solutions are numerically converged already at the coarsest resolution, with higher resolutions yielding almost identical outcomes. We introduce random perturbations to each radial bin, thus adding perturbations with a length scale that is related to the radial resolution. We study both time-independent and time-dependent perturbations to the matter density that affect the collision term and analyze their effects on neutrino flavor evolution. We find that such fluctuations do not induce any significant instabilities or qualitative changes in flavor evolution. Angular structure remains robust, and flavor-dependent number densities and energy spectra show only minor deviations compared to the unperturbed case. These findings suggest that matter perturbations have a negligible effect on neutrino flavor evolution in spherically symmetric settings.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray Contribution in AU Mic Flares and Its Minor Role in Atmospheric Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flares from stars can significantly impact the atmospheres of their orbiting planets, yet the role of hard X-ray (HXR; 3-20 keV) emission in driving escape and tracing particle acceleration remains poorly constrained. With the aim of quantifying the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we obtained a NuSTAR observation, quasi-simultaneous with Swift and Einstein Probe observations, of the young M1Ve star AU Mic, detecting two flares. We build an empirical soft X-ray (SXR; 0.3-3 keV)-HXR scaling relation and, on that basis, quantify the HXR share of the total radiative budget, defined as the sum of extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 0.01-0.3 keV), SXR, and HXR, and assess its effect on atmospheric escape. We find that the HXR fraction is 1.7% in quiescence and rises to 3.3% at flare peaks; even adopting the EUV + SXR (collectively referred to as XUV) escape efficiency as an upper bound, HXR-powered mass loss amounts to only a few percent of the XUV-driven rate. High-energy spectral tails are detected in quiescence and in Flare 2. Both nonthermal and high temperature thermal models provide acceptable fits to the data; however, the presence of two localized Neupert effect episodes in Flare 2, combined with the implausibly large energy budget required for a 290 MK plasma, strongly favors a nonthermal interpretation. Consistent with this picture, spectral-timing analysis shows that the 6-20 keV share of the emission actually declines during flares, while heating is dominated by 3-6 keV photons-implying rapid thermalization of accelerated electrons and a predominantly thermal energy release. Overall, the flares are thermally dominated, nonthermal electrons can power chromospheric heating episodically, but HXR-induced escape appears to be marginal for the long-term atmospheric evolution of AU Mic's planets.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Equilibration in the Merging Galaxy Cluster Abell 665</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers drive powerful shock fronts that heat the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and accelerate particles, redistributing the energy in a merger. Abell 665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock ($M \sim 3$) and provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale. Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how energy from the merger is distributed between thermal and non-thermal particle populations. Using $\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an instant, collisionless model where ions and electrons are immediately heated at the shock front, and (2) a collisional model where electrons are initially adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the ions over $\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed equilibration model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0 \pm 3.4) \times 10^8$ yrs. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($M = 2.8 \pm 0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large scale structure formation, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Binary black hole population inference combining confident and marginal events from the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ search pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the population properties of binary black hole mergers identified by the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ pipeline (which incorporates higher-order modes in the search templates) during the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) detectors. In our population inference analysis, instead of only using events above a sharp cut based on a particular detection threshold (e.g., false alarm rate), we use a Bayesian framework to consistently include both marginal and confident events. We find that our inference based solely on highly significant events ($p_{\mathrm{astro}} \sim 1$) is broadly consistent with the GWTC-3 population analysis performed by the LVK collaboration. However, incorporating marginal events into the analysis leads to a preference for stronger redshift evolution in the merger rate and an increased density of asymmetric mass-ratio mergers relative to the GWTC-3 analysis, while remaining within its allowed parameter ranges. Using simple parametric models to describe the binary black hole population, we estimate a merger rate density of $32.4^{+18.5}_{-12.2}\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at redshift $z = 0.2$, and a redshift evolution parameter of $\kappa = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$. Assuming a power-law form for the mass ratio distribution ($\propto q^{\beta}$), we infer $\beta = 0.1^{+1.9}_{-1.4}$, indicating a relatively flat distribution. These results highlight the potential impact of marginal events on population inferences and motivate future analyses with data from upcoming observing runs.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy of collapsing and merging neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy is an important pillar when studying gravitational waves from black holes and enables tests of general relativity. Most of the gravitational-wave signals observed over the last decade originate from binary black hole systems. Binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star systems are rarer but of particular interest for the next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These events offer the exciting possibility of studying matter effects on the ringdown of "dirty black holes". In this work, we ask the question: Does matter matter? Using numerical-relativity, we simulate a wide range of collapsing neutron stars producing matter environments, both in isolated scenarios and in binary mergers. Qualitatively, the resulting ringdown signals can be classified into "clean", "modified", and "distorted" cases, depending on the amount of matter that is present. We apply standard strategies for extracting quasinormal modes of clean signals, using both theory-agnostic and theory-specific assumptions. Even in the presence of matter, possible modifications of quasinormal modes seem to be dominated by ringdown modeling systematics. We find that incorporating multiple quasinormal modes allows one to drastically reduce mismatches and errors in estimating the final black hole mass at early times. If not treated carefully, deviations in the fundamental quasinormal mode might artificially be overestimated and falsely attributed to the presence of matter or violations of general relativity.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrino signatures from pulsar remnants of binary neutron-star mergers: coincident detection prospects with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers are accompanied by multi-messenger emissions, including gravitational wave (GW), neutrino, and electromagnetic signals. Some fraction of BNS mergers may result in a rapidly spinning magnetar as a remnant, which can enhance both the EM and neutrino emissions. In this study, we model the neutrino emissions from such systems and discuss the prospects for detecting the neutrinos coincident with GW signatures. We consider a scenario where a magnetar remnant drives a pulsar wind using its spin energy. The wind interacts with the surrounding kilonova ejecta, forming a nebula filled with non-thermal photons. Ions and nuclei extracted from the magnetar's surface can be accelerated in the polar-cap and the termination-shock regions. We investigate the neutrino fluences resulting from photomeson interactions, where accelerated CR protons interact with the photons in the nebula. Our findings indicate that the peak neutrino fluence is $\sim 10^{-2}\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$ for a source at $40$ Mpc, which is reached approximately $\mathcal{O}( 1-10\ {\rm days})$ post merger. Finally, we examine the potential for GW-triggered stacking searches with IceCube-Gen2 using next-generation GW detectors such as the Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). We conclude that, assuming an optimistic neutrino emission model, a combination of CE+ET would offer a high probability of neutrino detection from these sources within an operational timescale of $\sim 20$ years. In case of non-detection, $2 \sigma$ level constraints on model parameters can be established within similar joint operation timescales.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Emissions from Neutron Star Merger Remnants: Implications for Nuclear Equation of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observation of binary neutron-star mergers can provide valuable information on the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Here, we investigate to which extent electromagnetic observations of the associated kilonovae allow us to place constraints on the EoS. For this, we use state-of-the-art three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics simulations and detailed nucleosynthesis modeling to connect properties of observed light curves to properties of the accretion disk, and hence, the EoS. Using our general approach, we use multi-messenger observations of GW170817/AT2017gfo to study the impact of various sources of uncertainty on inferences of the EoS. We constrain the radius of a $\rm{1.4 M_\odot}$ neutron star to lie within $\rm{10.19\leq R_{1.4}\leq 13.0}$~km and the maximum mass to be $\rm{M_{TOV}\leq 3.06 M_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Impact of propagation effects on the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mathematical analysis of propagation-induced distortions in the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Within the Triggered Relativistic Dynamical Model, we derive a centroid-based formulation of the sub-burst slope law, which is an inverse relation between frequency-drift rate and temporal width of sub-bursts. We extend our analysis to include two frequency-dependent propagation effects: (i) multipath scattering, characterized by a pulse-broadening timescale $\tau_\mathrm{sc} \propto \nu^{-4}$, and (ii) residual dispersion, parameterized by $\Delta \mathrm{DM}\propto \nu^{-2}$. Our analysis shows that scattering preserves the inverse relation between sub-burst slope and duration, but increases the scaling coefficient when $\tau_\mathrm{sc}$ exceeds the intrinsic width ($t_\mathrm{w}$) of sub-bursts. Residual DM errors act asymmetrically: under-dedispersion flattens the sub-burst slope, whereas over-dedispersion causes a non-linear increase and eventually a change of sign. When both effects are present, scattering counterbalances the steepening induced by over-dedispersion and augments the flattening produced by under-dedispersion, yielding characteristically distorted curves. We repeat measurements for ultra-short duration bursts (ultra-FRBs) with $t_\mathrm{w} = 50\ \mu\mathrm{s}$ at 1 GHz and found them to be far more sensitive to propagation errors. Deviations become measurable for $\left | \Delta \mathrm{DM} \right |\sim0.05$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and for $\tau_\mathrm{sc} \sim0.1$ ms at 1 GHz, levels that have negligible impact on the standard-width sub-bursts. Our analysis provides practical diagnostics to disentangle propagation effects from the observed spectro-temporal properties of FRBs, thereby recovering true correlations among their intrinsic parameters.</description>

      <title>Science Opportunities of Wet Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike "dry EMRIs", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Cyclic Spectroscopy in the Partial-Deconvolution Regime: Benefits &amp; Limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore possible advantages of cyclic spectroscopy for observations of pulsars in instances where full cyclic deconvolution is not feasible. We compute cyclic merits and full-deconvolution regime boundaries for pulsars observed by NANOGrav and discuss which sources stand to benefit the most from using cyclic spectroscopy when observed with the Green Bank Telescope and DSA-2000 in a given frequency range. We compare data products, namely the wavefield, in both full-deconvolution and partial-deconvolution regimes to demonstrate what can be accomplished with incomplete phase retrieval. Additionally, we show how some phase retrieval can still be achieved in the partial-deconvolution regime and how this allows for additional information in scintillation-based data products, like the dynamic wavefield power, compared to what can be found in traditional dynamic spectra. An examination of dynamic wavefield phase as a function of observing frequency reveals more complete phase retrieval is achieved the closer one gets to the full deconvolution regime, agreeing with the expectations of cyclic merit. While we demonstrate that fragmentary recovery of the secondary wavefield can be accomplished in the partial-deconvolution regime, we advocate for a synergistic approach with phase retrieval methods like the $\theta-\theta$ transform, although we also provide discussion about shortcomings of this strategy. Finally, we use the combination of modest cyclic merit and lack of discernible results for PSR J1903$+$0327 to motivate the creation of an updated "cyclic merit 2.0", which relies on scintillation bandwidth instead of observing bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic signatures from pulsar remnants of binary neutron star mergers: prospects for unique identification using multi-wavelength signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can result in the formation of long-lived magnetar remnants which can enhance neutrino and electromagnetic (EM) emissions. In this work, we study the resulting multi-wavelength EM emissions and the prospects of their detectability in the current and upcoming EM telescopes. We model the pulsar-wind neubla system where the long-lived pulsar with dipolar magnetic fields of $10^{13} - 10^{15}$ G (magnetar) spins down and is surrounded by an outward expanding nebula and kilonova ejecta. Although at early times post the merger, the EM signatures are unobservable due to heavy attenuation, they become observable on timescales of $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ days after the merger. We find that the survey and follow-up observations have horizon distances $\gtrsim 1\ \rm Gpc$ for most of the wavebands and conclude that the detection prospects for such long-lived remnants in the electromagnetic channel are promising. This is of crucial importance for multi-messenger observations from BNS mergers to constrain the physical parameters of the remnants. Furthermore, we highlight how observations across the electromagnetic band can uniquely identify magnetar-powered transients resulting from BNS mergers and establish concrete associations of the detected gravitational wave signatures with such transients.</description>

      <title>Discovery of diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G213.0-0.6: Supernova remnant versus massive star-forming region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G213.0-0.6, which is debated as a supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found three extended sources with different photon spectra in this region, which will label as SrcA, SrcB and SrcC. Among them, the $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a log-parabola spectrum is spatially coincident with a star-forming region and several OB stars. The power-law spectra source SrcB is spatially coincident with a SNR radio shell. SrcC with a harder power-law photon spectrum is located outside of the radio shell structure. All of them are spatially coincident with a dense molecular cloud (MC) in the velocity range of 35 - 54 km s$^{-1}$. In this scenario, SrcB can be interpreted as the GeV counterpart of the SNR, and its $\gamma$-ray emission originates from the shock-cloud interaction. SrcA and SrcC originate from the escaped CRs illuminating nearby MC. For SrcA, another possibility is that the $\gamma$-ray emission originates from a young stellar cluster (YSC) associated with a star-forming region (SFR), however, the supporting evidence remains insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</description>

Abstract: The recent detection of fast-moving stars in the core of Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, has provided strong evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). As $\omega$ Cen, is likely the accreted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, this IMBH also represents a unique opportunity to study BH seeding mechanisms and their potential role in the formation of supermassive BHs. We present Monte Carlo $N$-body models of $\omega$ Cen with detailed treatments for the loss cone dynamics involving stars, binaries, and compact objects. Starting with BH seeds of $500-5000 \, M_{\odot}$ (consistent with runaway collisions of massive stars), our cluster models grow IMBHs with masses of $\sim50{,}000 \, M_{\odot}$ after 12 Gyr, while successfully reproducing the present-day surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of $\omega$ Cen. We find a population of fast stars similar to those observed in the core of $\omega$ Cen, with the fastest stars originating from binaries that were tidally disrupted by the IMBH. The IMBH growth is primarily driven by mergers with $30-40 \, M_{\odot}$ BHs, suggesting a present-day IMBH-BH merger rate of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in $\omega$ Cen-like GCs. Our models also predict a similar rate of tidal disruption events ($\sim5\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$) which, depending on the frequency of $\omega$ Cen-like GCs per galaxy, may represent anywhere from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$ of the observed TDE rate.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dark matter and $\sigma$-cut potential on radial and non-radial oscillation modes in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS) employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of $\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut, we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect. For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequency, damping time, and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$ cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.</description>

      <title>Influence of Density Distribution on Synchrotron Polarization Dispersion in Magnetized Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02938</link>

Abstract: Faraday rotation measure (RM) synthesis is a well-known approach originated in Burn (1966) and later developed by Brentjens \&amp; de Bruyn (2005) for studying magnetic fields. This work presents a complementary approach--the polarization frequency analysis (PFA)--allowing for the properties of the turbulent magnetic field, which are difficult to include in Burn's original approach. Based on synthetic polarization observation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulation data, we study the influence of the coupling effect between density and magnetic field on synchrotron polarization dispersion. By applying the PFA to different simulated interstellar turbulence environments, we find that the PFA technique can reveal the scaling slope of the turbulent magnetic field in the case of a weak coupling effect and can also reflect the scaling slope of the RM in the case of a strong coupling effect. Since it avoids the influence of Faraday depolarization, the PFA technique is a promising way to uncover turbulence properties using observational data from the Low-Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy and the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Deep-Learning-Based Mass Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays using Simulated Air-Shower Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.</description>

      <title>The observation image of a soliton boson star illuminated by various accretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the observable signatures of solitonic boson stars by employing ray-tracing simulations, with celestial spheres and thin accretion disks serving as illumination sources. By numerically fitting the metric form, we solve the geodesic equation for photons under the influence of the soliton potential, enabling us to simulate the optical appearance of the soliton boson star in two distinct regimes. In the weak coupling case (larger value of coupling parameter $\alpha$) with an initial scalar field $\psi_0$, the images on the screen predominantly show direct and lensed images, where $\psi_0$ and $\alpha$ modulate the image region size while the observation inclination $\theta$ controls morphological asymmetry. In the case of strong coupling (small value of $\alpha$), the images on the screen show a nested sub-annulus within the Einstein ring in the celestial model, whereas thin disk accretion models reveal higher-order lensing images indicative that photons are capable of orbiting the equatorial plane of the boson star multiple times. We also analyze how the effective potential and redshift factor depend on the correlation parameter. At low inclination($\theta&lt;30^{\circ})$, the redshift is the dominant effect, the image is characterized by a dim central cavity enclosed by a bright ring. At high inclination ($\theta&gt;60^{\circ})$, the Doppler effect becomes more pronounced, resulting in a substantial brightness disparity between the left and right sides of the optical image. These findings offer robust theoretical underpinnings for differentiating solitonic boson stars from black holes via high-resolution astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Populations of evolved massive binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud I: Predictions from detailed evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The majority of massive stars are born with a close binary companion. How this affects their evolution and fate is still largely uncertain, especially at low metallicity. Aims. We derive synthetic populations of massive post-interaction binary products and compare them with corresponding observed populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. We analyse 53298 detailed binary evolutionary models computed with MESA. Our models include the physics of rotation, mass and angular momentum transfer, magnetic internal angular momentum transport, and tidal spin-orbit coupling. They cover initial primary masses of 5-100Msun, initial mass ratios of 0.3-0.95, and all initial periods for which interaction is expected. They are evolved through the first mass transfer and the donor star death, a possible ensuing Be/X-ray binary phase, and they end when the mass gainer leaves the main sequence. Results.In our fiducial synthetic population, 8% of the OB stars in the SMC are post-mass transfer systems, and 7% are merger products. In many of our models, the mass gainers are spun up and form Oe/Be stars. While our model underpredicts the number of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, it reproduces the main features of their orbital period distribution and the observed number of SMC binary WR stars. We expect $\sim$50 OB+BH binaries below and $\sim$170 above 20d orbital period. The latter might produce merging double BHs. However, their progenitors, the predicted long-period WR+OB binaries, are not observed. Conclusions. While the comparison with the observed SMC stars supports many physics assumptions in our high-mass binary models, a better match of the large number of observed OBe stars and Be/X-ray binaries likely requires a lower merger rate and/or a higher mass transfer efficiency during the first mass transfer. The fate of the initially wide O star binaries remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>The Prospect from the Upcoming CMB Experiment LiteBIRD to Discover Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.</description>
