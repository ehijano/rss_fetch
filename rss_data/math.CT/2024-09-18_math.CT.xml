      <title>Hypercubes, $n$-groupoids, and mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of composite mixtures consisting of $n$ constituents is framed within the schema provided by the notion of $n$-groupoid. The point of departure is the analysis of $n$-dimensional hypercubes and their skeletons, to each of whose edges an element (an arrow) of one of $n$ given material groupoids is assigned according to the coordinate class to which it belongs. In this way a $GL(3,{\mathbb R})$-weighted digraph is obtained. It is shown that if the double groupoid associated with each pair of constituents consists of commuting squares, the resulting $n$-groupoid is conservative. The core of this $n$-groupoid is transitive if, and only if, the mixture is materially uniform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positively closed and strongly positively closed $\mathcal{C}\to Sh(B)$ models, where $\mathcal{C}$ is a $(\kappa ,\kappa )$-coherent category and $B$ is a $(\kappa ,\kappa )$-coherent Boolean-algebra for some weakly compact $\kappa $. We prove that if $\mathcal{C}$ is coherent and $X$ is a Stone-space then positively closed, not strongly positively closed $\mathcal{C}\to Sh(X)$ models may exist.</description>

      <title>$\infty$-operadic foundations for embedding calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to spaces of embeddings and automorphisms of manifolds, we consider a tower of $\infty$-categories of truncated right-modules over a unital $\infty$-operad $\mathcal{O}$. We study monoidality and naturality properties of this tower, identify its layers, describe the difference between the towers as $\mathcal{O}$ varies, and generalise these results to the level of Morita $(\infty,2)$-categories. Applied to the ${\rm BO}(d)$-framed $E_d$-operad, this extends Goodwillie-Weiss' embedding calculus and its layer identification to the level of bordism categories. Applied to other variants of the $E_d$-operad, it yields new versions of embedding calculus, such as one for topological embeddings, based on ${\rm BTop}(d)$, or one similar to Boavida de Brito-Weiss' configuration categories, based on ${\rm BAut}(E_d)$. In addition, we prove a delooping result in the context of embedding calculus, establish a convergence result for topological embedding calculus, improve upon the smooth convergence result of Goodwillie, Klein, and Weiss, and deduce an Alexander trick for homology 4-spheres.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck construction in the context of tangent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grothendieck construction establishes an equivalence between fibrations, a.k.a. fibred categories, and indexed categories, and is one of the fundamental results of category theory. Cockett and Cruttwell introduced the notion of fibrations into the context of tangent categories and proved that the fibres of a tangent fibration inherit a tangent structure from the total tangent category. The main goal of this paper is to provide a Grothendieck construction for tangent fibrations. Our first attempt will focus on providing a correspondence between tangent fibrations and indexed tangent categories, which are collections of tangent categories and tangent morphisms indexed by the objects and morphisms of a base tangent category. We will show that this construction inverts Cockett and Cruttwell's result but it does not provide a full equivalence between these two concepts. In order to understand how to define a genuine Grothendieck equivalence in the context of tangent categories, inspired by Street's formal approach to monad theory we introduce a new concept: tangent objects. We show that tangent fibrations arise as tangent objects of a suitable $2$-category and we employ this characterization to lift the Grothendieck construction between fibrations and indexed categories to a genuine Grothendieck equivalence between tangent fibrations and tangent indexed categories.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $i)$ if $\mathcal{A}$ is $\lambda $-accessible and it is axiomatizable in (finitary) coherent logic then $\lambda $-pure maps are strict monomorphisms and $ii)$ if there is a proper class of strongly compact cardinals and $\mathcal{A}$ is $\lambda $-accessible then for some $\mu \vartriangleright \lambda $ every $\mu $-pure map is a strict monomorphism.</description>

      <title>Stable homology of Lie algebras of derivations and homotopy invariants of wheeled operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18594v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a theorem that computes, for any augmented operad $\mathcal{O}$, the stable homology of the Lie algebra of derivations of the free algebra $\mathcal{O}(V)$ with twisted bivariant coefficients (here stabilization occurs as $\dim(V)\to\infty$) out of the homology of the wheeled bar construction of $\mathcal{O}$; this can further be used to prove uniform mixed representation stability for the homology of the positive part of that Lie algebra with constant coefficients. This result generalizes both the Loday-Quillen-Tsygan theorem on the homology of the Lie algebra of infinite matrices and the Fuchs stability theorem for the homology of the Lie algebra of vector fields. We also prove analogous theorems for the Lie algebras of derivations with zero divergence, in which case one has to consider the wheeled bar construction of the wheeled completion of $\mathcal{O}$. Similarly to how cyclic homology of an algebra $A$ may be viewed as an additive version of the algebraic $K$-theory of $A$, our results hint at the additive $K$-theoretic nature of the wheeled bar construction.</description>

      <title>Examples and cofibrant generation of effective Kan fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will show make two contributions to the theory of effective Kan fibrations, which are a more explicit version of the notion of a Kan fibration, a notion which plays a fundamental role in simplicial homotopy theory. We will show that simplicial Malcev algebras are effective Kan complexes and that the effective Kan fibrations can be seen as the right class in an algebraic weak factorisation system. In addition, we will introduce two strengthenings of the notion of an effective Kan fibration, the symmetric effective and degenerate-preferring Kan fibrations, and show that the previous results holds for these strengthenings as well.</description>
