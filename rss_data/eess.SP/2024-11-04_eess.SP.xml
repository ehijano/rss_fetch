      <title>CRB Optimization using a Parametric Scattering Model for Extended Targets in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel parametric scattering model (PSM) for sensing extended targets in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The PSM addresses the limitations of traditional models by efficiently capturing the target's angular characteristics through a compact set of key parameters, including the central angle and angular spread, enabling efficient optimization. Based on the PSM, we first derive the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for parameter estimation and then propose a beamforming design algorithm to minimize the CRB while meeting both communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and power constraints. By integrating the PSM into the beamforming optimization process, the proposed framework achieves superior CRB performance while balancing the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and communication quality. Simulation results demonstrate that the PSM-based approach consistently outperforms traditional unstructured and discrete scattering models, particularly in resource-limited scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability and scalability.</description>

      <title>A Novel Acoustic Wearable for Assessment of Tendon Health and Loading Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current methods of assessing tendon health such as clinical examination, imaging techniques, and implanted pressure sensors, are often based on a subjective assessment or are not accurate enough, are extremely expensive, or are limited to relatively large damage such as partial or gross tear of the tendon and cannot accurately assess and monitor smaller damages such as micro tears or strains. This study proposes an acoustic-based wearable capable of estimating tendon load and predicting damage severity in both deep and superficial tendons. Our device consists of an array of acoustic transducers positioned around the targeted body area in the form of a cuff. One of the transducers generates an acoustic wave, which is capable of penetrating deep into the body. As these waves propagate through different tissues, they are influenced by the mechanical and geometrical properties of each tissue. The rest of the transducers are used to measure the propagated waves. The results suggest that the proposed wearable offers a promising alternative to existing superficial tendon monitoring wearable devices by improving the domain of reach. The proposed wearable shows robust performance in estimating the force applied to the tendon. It also can effectively be used to compare the health condition of two tendons and predict the type of damage.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation on Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher Information Metric (FIM) and the associated Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) are fundamental tools in statistical signal processing, which inform the efficient design of experiments and algorithms for estimating the underlying parameters. In this article, we investigate these concepts for the case where the parameters lie on a homogeneous space. Unlike the existing Fisher-Rao theory for general Riemannian manifolds, our focus is to leverage the group-theoretic structure of homogeneous spaces, which is often much easier to work with than their Riemannian structure. The FIM is characterized by identifying the homogeneous space with a coset space, the group-theoretic CRB and its corollaries are presented, and its relationship to the Riemannian CRB is clarified. The application of our theory is illustrated using two examples from engineering: (i) estimation of the pose of a robot and (ii) sensor network localization. In particular, these examples demonstrate that homogeneous spaces provide a natural framework for studying statistical models that are invariant with respect to a group of symmetries.</description>

      <title>Power Source Allocation for RIS-aided Integrating Sensing, Communication, and Power Transfer Systems Based on NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication system framework based on a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing, communication, and power transmission (ISCPT) communication system. RIS is used to improve transmission efficiency and sensing accuracy. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is incorporated in RIS-aided ISCPT systems to boost the spectrum utilization efficiency of RIS-aided ISCPT systems. We consider the power minimization problem of the RIS-aided ISCPT-NOMA system. Power minimization is achieved by jointly optimizing the RIS phase shift, decoding order, power splitting (PS) factor, and transmit beamforming while satisfying quality of service (QoS), radar target sensing accuracy, and energy harvesting constraints. Since the objective function and constraints in the optimization problem are non-convex, the problem is an NP-hard problem. To solve the non-convex problem, this paper proposes a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. Specifically, the non-convex problem is divided into four sub-problems: i.e. the transmit beamforming, RIS phase shift, decoding order and PS factor optimization subproblems. We employ semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to address the transmit beamforming optimization sub-problem. Subsequently, we leverage the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the RIS phase shift optimization problem. As for the decoding order optimization, we provide a closed-form expression. For the PS factor optimization problem, the SCA algorithm is proposed. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and highlight the balanced performance achieved across sensing, communication, and power transfer.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming for Multi-target Detection and Multi-user Communication in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting weak targets is one of the main challenges for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Sensing and communication suffer from a performance trade-off in ISAC systems. As the communication demand increases, sensing ability, especially weak target detection performance, will inevitably reduce. Traditional approaches fail to address this issue. In this paper, we develop a joint beamforming scheme and formulate it as a max-min problem to maximize the detection probability of the weakest target under the constraint of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of multi-user communication. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed for solving the complicated non-convex problem to obtain the joint beamformer. The proposed scheme can direct the transmit energy toward the multiple targets properly to ensure robust multi-target detection performance. Numerical results show that the proposed beamforming scheme can effectively increase the detection probability of the weakest target compared to baseline approaches while ensuring communication performance.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Trade-offs in Quantized Hybrid Radar Fusion: A CRB-Rate Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent advancements have highlighted the role of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the specific impact of ADC resolution on hybrid radar fusion (HRF) remains relatively unexplored. The uplink (UL) paths in HRF, comprising both direct and reflected signals within the same frequency band, pose unique challenges, particularly given that the reflected signal is often significantly weaker than the direct path, making HRF systems susceptible to ADC resolution. To investigate the influence of quantization and ADC resolution on HRF, we employ the quantized Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as a metric for sensing accuracy. This work derives the quantized CRB specifically for HRF systems and the quantized communication rate. We extend our analysis to obtain lower bounds on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and UL communication rates, which we use to characterize quantized HRF systems. Using these derived bounds, we analyze quantized HRF systems through the lens of CRB-rate boundaries. We obtain the CRB-rate boundary through two optimization problems, where each solution point represents a trade-off boundary between the sensing accuracy and the communication rate. Extensive simulations illustrate the influence of ADC resolution, DR, and various system parameters on the CRB-rate boundary of HRF systems. These results offer critical insights into the design of efficient and high-performance HRF systems.</description>

      <title>Kernel Operator-Theoretic Bayesian Filter for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the surge of interest in Koopman operator theory, we propose a machine-learning alternative based on a functional Bayesian perspective for operator-theoretic modeling of unknown, data-driven, nonlinear dynamical systems. This formulation is directly done in an infinite-dimensional space of linear operators or Hilbert space with universal approximation property. The theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) allows the lifting of nonlinear dynamics to a potentially infinite-dimensional space via linear embeddings, where a general nonlinear function is represented as a set of linear functions or operators in the functional space. This allows us to apply classical linear Bayesian methods such as the Kalman filter directly in the Hilbert space, yielding nonlinear solutions in the original input space. This kernel perspective on the Koopman operator offers two compelling advantages. First, the Hilbert space can be constructed deterministically, agnostic to the nonlinear dynamics. The Gaussian kernel is universal, approximating uniformly an arbitrary continuous target function over any compact domain. Second, Bayesian filter is an adaptive, linear minimum-variance algorithm, allowing the system to update the Koopman operator and continuously track the changes across an extended period of time, ideally suited for modern data-driven applications such as real-time machine learning using streaming data. In this paper, we present several practical implementations to obtain a finite-dimensional approximation of the functional Bayesian filter (FBF). Due to the rapid decay of the Gaussian kernel, excellent approximation is obtained with a small dimension. We demonstrate that this practical approach can obtain accurate results and outperform finite-dimensional Koopman decomposition.</description>

      <title>Semantic Knowledge Distillation for Onboard Satellite Earth Observation Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative dynamic weighting knowledge distillation (KD) framework tailored for efficient Earth observation (EO) image classification (IC) in resource-constrained settings. Utilizing EfficientViT and MobileViT as teacher models, this framework enables lightweight student models, particularly ResNet8 and ResNet16, to surpass 90% in accuracy, precision, and recall, adhering to the stringent confidence thresholds necessary for reliable classification tasks. Unlike conventional KD methods that rely on static weight distribution, our adaptive weighting mechanism responds to each teacher model's confidence, allowing student models to prioritize more credible sources of knowledge dynamically. Remarkably, ResNet8 delivers substantial efficiency gains, achieving a 97.5% reduction in parameters, a 96.7% decrease in FLOPs, an 86.2% cut in power consumption, and a 63.5% increase in inference speed over MobileViT. This significant optimization of complexity and resource demands establishes ResNet8 as an optimal candidate for EO tasks, combining robust performance with feasibility in deployment. The confidence-based, adaptable KD approach underscores the potential of dynamic distillation strategies to yield high-performing, resource-efficient models tailored for satellite-based EO applications. The reproducible code is accessible on our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Discrete RIS Enhanced Space Shift Keying MIMO System via Reflecting Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a discrete reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted spatial shift keying (SSK) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme is investigated, in which a direct link between the transmitter and the receiver is considered. To improve the reliability of the RIS-SSK-MIMO scheme, we formulate an objective function based on minimizing the average bit error probability (ABEP). Since the reflecting phase shift of RIS is discrete, it is difficult to address this problem directly. To this end, we optimize the RIS phase shift to maximize the Euclidean distance between the minimum constellations by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) and penaltyalternating optimization method. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed RIS-SSK-MIMO scheme and demonstrate the impact of the number of RIS elements, the number of phase quantization bits, and the number of receive and transmit antennas in terms of reliability.</description>

      <title>Power-Measurement-Based Channel Autocorrelation Estimation for IRS-Assisted Wideband Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The passive and frequency-flat reflection of IRS, as well as the high-dimensional IRS-reflected channels, have posed significant challenges for efficient IRS channel estimation, especially in wideband communication systems with significant multi-path channel delay spread. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered framework for IRS channel autocorrelation matrix estimation in wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This framework relies only on the easily accessible reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements at users in existing wideband communication systems, without requiring additional pilot transmission. Based on the estimates of channel autocorrelation matrix, the passive reflection of IRS is optimized to maximize the average user received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all subcarriers in the OFDM system. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing powermeasurement-based IRS reflection designs in wideband channels.</description>

      <title>Distributed Computation Offloading for Energy Provision Minimization in WP-MEC Networks with Multiple HAPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a wireless powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) network with multiple hybrid access points (HAPs) in a dynamic environment, where wireless devices (WDs) harvest energy from radio frequency (RF) signals of HAPs, and then compute their computation data locally (i.e., local computing mode) or offload it to the chosen HAPs (i.e., edge computing mode). In order to pursue a green computing design, we formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the long-term energy provision of the WP-MEC network subject to the energy, computing delay and computation data demand constraints. The transmit power of HAPs, the duration of the wireless power transfer (WPT) phase, the offloading decisions of WDs, the time allocation for offloading and the CPU frequency for local computing are jointly optimized adapting to the time-varying generated computation data and wireless channels of WDs. To efficiently address the formulated non-convex mixed integer programming (MIP) problem in a distributed manner, we propose a Two-stage Multi-Agent deep reinforcement learning-based Distributed computation Offloading (TMADO) framework, which consists of a high-level agent and multiple low-level agents. The high-level agent residing in all HAPs optimizes the transmit power of HAPs and the duration of the WPT phase, while each low-level agent residing in each WD optimizes its offloading decision, time allocation for offloading and CPU frequency for local computing. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed TMADO framework in terms of the energy provision minimization.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal semantic segmentation for indoor environmental perception using single-chip millimeter-wave radar raw data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of firefighting and rescue operations, a cross-modal semantic segmentation model based on a single-chip millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar for indoor environmental perception is proposed and discussed. To efficiently obtain high-quality labels, an automatic label generation method utilizing LiDAR point clouds and occupancy grid maps is introduced. The proposed segmentation model is based on U-Net. A spatial attention module is incorporated, which enhanced the performance of the mode. The results demonstrate that cross-modal semantic segmentation provides a more intuitive and accurate representation of indoor environments. Unlike traditional methods, the model's segmentation performance is minimally affected by azimuth. Although performance declines with increasing distance, this can be mitigated by a well-designed model. Additionally, it was found that using raw ADC data as input is ineffective; compared to RA tensors, RD tensors are more suitable for the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the use of Compression in Virtual Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Production (VP) technologies have continued to improve the flexibility of on-set filming and enhance the live concert experience. The core technology of VP relies on high-resolution, high-brightness LED panels to playback/render video content. There are a number of technical challenges to effective deployment e.g. image tile synchronisation across the panels, cross panel colour balancing and compensating for colour fluctuations due to changes in camera angles. Given the complexity and potential quality degradation, the industry prefers "pristine" or lossless compressed source material for displays, which requires significant storage and bandwidth. Modern lossy compression standards like AV1 or H.265 could maintain the same quality at significantly lower bitrates and resource demands. There is yet no agreed methodology for assessing the impact of these standards on quality when the VP scene is recorded in-camera. We present a methodology to assess this impact by comparing lossless and lossy compressed footage displayed through VP screens and recorded in-camera. We assess the quality impact of HAP/NotchLC/Daniel2 and AV1/HEVC/H.264 compression bitrates from 2 Mb/s to 2000 Mb/s with various GOP sizes. Several perceptual quality metrics are then used to automatically evaluate in-camera picture quality, referencing the original uncompressed source content through the LED wall. Our results show that we can achieve the same quality with hybrid codecs as with intermediate encoders at orders of magnitude less bitrate and storage requirements.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Excitable Spiking Laser Neuron in InP Generic Integration Technology</title>

Abstract: Brain-inspired, neuromorphic devices implemented in integrated photonic hardware have attracted significant interest recently as part of efforts towards novel non-von Neumann computing paradigms that make use of the low loss, high-speed and parallel operations in optics. An all-optical spiking laser neuron fabricated on the indium-phosphide generic integration technology platform may be a practical alternative to other semi-integrated photonic and electronic-based spiking neuron implementations. Owing to the large number of predefined building blocks, a plethora of applications have benefitted already from the generic integration process. This technology platform has now been utilised for the first time to demonstrate an all-optical spiking laser neuron. This paper present and discusses the design and measurement of the ultra-fast and rich spiking dynamics in these devices. We show that under external pulse injection and operated slightly below the lasing threshold, the laser neuron exhibits an excitable mode, in addition to a self-spiking mode far above the threshold when no pulse is injected. In the excitable mode, the required injected pulse energy is much lower than that of the generated excited response, meeting an important requirement for neuron cascadability. In addition, we investigate excitability at different injection wavelengths below the lasing wavelength, as well as the ultra-fast temporal properties of the spiking response. All of the discussed characteristics point to the laser neuron being an important candidate for scaling up to future fully-connected, multi-wavelength all-optical photonic spiking neural networks in indium-phosphide generic integration technology.</description>

      <title>Nightbeat: Heart Rate Estimation From a Wrist-Worn Accelerometer During Sleep</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's fitness bands and smartwatches typically track heart rates (HR) using optical sensors. Large behavioral studies such as the UK Biobank use activity trackers without such optical sensors and thus lack HR data, which could reveal valuable health trends for the wider population. In this paper, we present the first dataset of wrist-worn accelerometer recordings and electrocardiogram references in uncontrolled at-home settings to investigate the recent promise of IMU-only HR estimation via ballistocardiograms. Our recordings are from 42 patients during the night, totaling 310 hours. We also introduce a frequency-based method to extract HR via curve tracing from IMU recordings while rejecting motion artifacts. Using our dataset, we analyze existing baselines and show that our method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.88 bpm -- 76% better than previous approaches. Our results validate the potential of IMU-only HR estimation as a key indicator of cardiac activity in existing longitudinal studies to discover novel health insights. Our dataset, Nightbeat-DB, and our source code are available on GitHub: https://github.com/eth-siplab/Nightbeat.</description>

      <title>Du-IN: Discrete units-guided mask modeling for decoding speech from Intracranial Neural signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invasive brain-computer interfaces with Electrocorticography (ECoG) have shown promise for high-performance speech decoding in medical applications, but less damaging methods like intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) remain underexplored. With rapid advances in representation learning, leveraging abundant recordings to enhance speech decoding is increasingly attractive. However, popular methods often pre-train temporal models based on brain-level tokens, overlooking that brain activities in different regions are highly desynchronized during tasks. Alternatively, they pre-train spatial-temporal models based on channel-level tokens but fail to evaluate them on challenging tasks like speech decoding, which requires intricate processing in specific language-related areas. To address this issue, we collected a well-annotated Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset targeting language-related brain networks from 12 subjects. Using this benchmark, we developed the Du-IN model, which extracts contextual embeddings based on region-level tokens through discrete codex-guided mask modeling. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 61-word classification task, surpassing all baselines. Model comparisons and ablation studies reveal that our design choices, including (i) temporal modeling based on region-level tokens by utilizing 1D depthwise convolution to fuse channels in the ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and (ii) self-supervision through discrete codex-guided mask modeling, significantly contribute to this performance. Overall, our approach -- inspired by neuroscience findings and capitalizing on region-level representations from specific brain regions -- is suitable for invasive brain modeling and represents a promising neuro-inspired AI approach in brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation and Reconstruction in Fluid Antenna System: Oversampling is Essential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) has recently surfaced as a promising technology for the upcoming sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. Unlike traditional antenna system (TAS) with fixed antenna location, FAS introduces a flexible component in which the radiating element can switch its position within a predefined space. This capability allows FAS to achieve additional diversity and multiplexing gains. Nevertheless, to fully reap the benefits of FAS, obtaining channel state information (CSI) over the predefined space is crucial. In this paper, we study the system with a transmitter equipped with a traditional fixed antenna and a receiver with a fluid antenna by considering an electromagnetic-compliant channel model. We address the challenges of channel estimation and reconstruction using Nyquist sampling and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tradeoff between the accuracy of the reconstructed channel and the number of estimated channels, indicating that half-wavelength sampling is insufficient for perfect reconstruction and that oversampling is essential to enhance accuracy. Despite its advantages, oversampling can introduce practical challenges. Consequently, we propose a suboptimal sampling distance that facilitates efficient channel reconstruction. In addition, we employ the MLE method to bound the channel estimation error by $\epsilon$, with a specific confidence interval (CI). Our findings enable us to determine the minimum number of estimated channels and the total number of pilot symbols required for efficient channel reconstruction in a given space. Lastly, we investigate the rate performance of FAS and TAS and demonstrate that FAS with imperfect CSI can outperform TAS with perfect CSI. In contrast to existing works, we also show that there is an optimal fluid antenna size that maximizes the achievable rate.</description>

      <title>HRRPGraphNet: Make HRRPs to Be Graphs for Efficient Target Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Resolution Range Profiles (HRRP) have become a key area of focus in the domain of Radar Automatic Target Recognition (RATR). Despite the success of deep learning based HRRP recognition, these methods needs a large amount of training samples to generate good performance, which could be a severe challenge under non-cooperative circumstances. Currently, deep learning based models treat HRRP as sequences, which may lead to ignorance of the internal relationship of range cells. This letter introduces HRRPGraphNet, whose pivotal innovation is the transformation of HRRP data into a novel graph structure, utilizing a range cell amplitude(hyphen)based node vector and a range(hyphen)relative adjacency matrix. This graph(hyphen)based approach facilitates both local feature extraction via one(hyphen)dimensional convolution layers, global feature extraction through a graph convolution layer and a attention module. Experiments on the aircraft electromagnetic simulation dataset confirmed HRRPGraphNet superior accuracy and robustness, particularly in limited training sample environments, underscoring the potential of graph(hyphen)driven innovations in HRRP(hyphen)based RATR.</description>

      <title>B-ISAC: Backscatter Integrated Sensing and Communication for IoE Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of backscatter communication (BackCom) technology with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology not only enhances the system sensing performance, but also enables low-power information transmission. This is expected to provide a new paradigm for communication and sensing in internet of everything (IoE) applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cognitive wireless system called backscatter-ISAC (B-ISAC) and develop a joint beamforming framework for different stages (task modes). This system can achieve cognitive spectrum sharing between legacy communication, backscatter communication and sensing functions. We derive communication performance metrics of the system in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and communication rate, and derive sensing performance metrics of the system in terms of probability of detection, error of linear least squares (LS) estimation, and the error of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation. The proposed joint beamforming framework consists of three stages: tag detection, tag estimation, and communication enhancement. We develop corresponding joint beamforming schemes aimed at enhancing the performance objectives of their respective stages by solving complex non-convex optimization problems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint beamforming schemes. The proposed B-ISAC system has broad application prospect in next generation IoE scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Efficiency of Movable and Rotary Antenna Arrays under Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most works evaluating the performance of Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) systems consider Access Points (APs) with fixed antennas, that is, without any movement capability. Recently, the idea of APs with antenna arrays that are able to move have gained traction among the research community. Many works evaluate the communications performance of Movable Antenna Arrays (MAAs) that can move on the horizontal plane. However, they require a very bulky, complex and expensive movement system. In this work, we propose a simpler and cheaper alternative: the utilization of Rotary Antenna Arrays (RAA)s, i.e. antenna arrays that can rotate. We also analyze the performance of a system in which the array is able to both move and rotate. The movements and/or rotations of the array are computed in order to maximize the mean per-user achievable spectral efficiency, based on estimates of the locations of the active devices and using particle swarm optimization. We adopt a spatially correlated Rician fading channel model, and evaluate the resulting optimized performance of the different setups in terms of mean per-user achievable spectral efficiencies. Our numerical results show that both the optimal rotations and movements of the arrays can provide substantial performance gains when the line-of-sight components of the channel vectors are strong. Moreover, the simpler RAAs can outperform the MAAs when their movement area is constrained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical results on the accuracy of fiber-longitudinal optical power monitoring (LPM) at arbitrary positions. To quantify the accuracy, the position-wise variance and power-profile SNR of LPM are defined and analyzed, yielding formulas for these metrics. Using these metrics, we show that various designs and performance predictions of LPM for a given link and estimation conditions are possible in a unified manner. Specifically, the required SNR to detect a given loss event is first presented. Based on this relation, the design parameters of LPM, such as the sample size and optical power required to detect the loss, are explicitly determined. The performance such as the detectable limit of loss events at individual positions and maximum dynamic range are also specified. These results can be used as a basis for establishing a design principle of LPM.</description>

      <title>Urban Outdoor Propagation Measurements and Channel Models at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Upper Mid-Band Spectrum for 5G and 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global allocations in the upper mid-band spectrum (4-24 GHz) necessitate a comprehensive exploration of the propagation behavior to meet the promise of coverage and capacity. This paper presents an extensive Urban Microcell (UMi) outdoor propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz conducted in Downtown Brooklyn, USA, using a 1 GHz bandwidth sliding correlation channel sounder over 40-880 m propagation distance, encompassing 6 Line of Sight (LOS) and 14 Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) locations. Analysis of the path loss (PL) reveals lower directional and omnidirectional PL exponents compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies in the UMi environment, using the close-in PL model with a 1 m reference distance. Additionally, a decreasing trend in root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS) with increasing frequency was observed. The NLOS RMS DS and RMS AS mean values are obtained consistently lower compared to 3GPP model predictions. Point data for all measured statistics at each TX-RX location are provided to supplement the models and results. The spatio-temporal statistics evaluated here offer valuable insights for the design of next-generation wireless systems and networks.</description>

      <title>Age of Information-Oriented Probabilistic Link Scheduling for Device-to-Device Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on optimizing the long-term average age of information (AoI) in device-to-device (D2D) networks through age-aware link scheduling. The problem is naturally formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, finding the optimal policy for the formulated MDP in its original form is challenging due to the intertwined AoI dynamics of all D2D links. To address this, we propose an age-aware stationary randomized policy that determines the probability of scheduling each link in each time slot based on the AoI of all links and the statistical channel state information among all transceivers. By employing the Lyapunov optimization framework, our policy aims to minimize the Lyapunov drift in every time slot. Nonetheless, this per-slot minimization problem is nonconvex due to cross-link interference in D2D networks, posing significant challenges for real-time decision-making. After analyzing the permutation equivariance property of the optimal solutions to the per-slot problem, we apply a message passing neural network (MPNN), a type of graph neural network that also exhibits permutation equivariance, to optimize the per-slot problem in an unsupervised learning manner. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed age-aware stationary randomized policy over baselines and validate the scalability of our method.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient deep learning solution for decoding motor movements from neural recordings in non-human primates. An Autoencoder Gated Recurrent Unit (AEGRU) model was adopted as the model architecture for this task. The autoencoder is only used during the training stage to achieve better generalization. Together with the preprocessing techniques, our model achieved 0.71 $R^2$ score, surpassing the baseline models in Neurobench and is ranked first for $R^2$ in the IEEE BioCAS 2024 Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Model pruning is also applied leading to a reduction of 41.4% of the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations with little change in the $R^2$ score compared to the unpruned model.</description>

Abstract: Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) systems, which interconnect chips using wireless links, face significant challenges in area and power consumption. To tackle these constraints, behavioral models (BMs) are crucial for assessing system performance under various conditions and optimizing parameters like data throughput and power consumption. Building transceivers (TRXs) physically is costly and time-consuming, making modeling a more practical approach. This paper develops a power consumption model for the sub-blocks of a WNoC transmitter (TX) at the chip level. By integrating these BMs with MATLAB, we aim to create a power model for TXs in WNoC architectures, optimized for CMOS technology operating at millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates simpler alternatives to coherent joint transmission for supporting robust connectivity against signal blockage in mmWave/sub-THz access networks. By taking an information-theoretic viewpoint, we demonstrate analytically that with a careful design, full macrodiversity gains and significant SNR gains can be achieved through canonical receivers and minimal coordination and synchronization requirements at the infrastructure side. Our proposed scheme extends non-coherent joint transmission by employing a special form of diversity to counteract artificially induced deep fades that would otherwise make this technique often compare unfavorably against standard transmitter selection schemes. Additionally, the inclusion of an Alamouti-like space-time coding layer is shown to recover a significant fraction of the optimal performance. Our conclusions are based on a statistical single-user multi-point intermittent block fading channel model that, although simplified, enables rigorous ergodic and outage rate analysis, while also considering timing offsets due to imperfect delay compensation. In addition, we validate our theoretical approach by means of deterministic ray-tracing simulations that capture the essential features of next generation mmWave/sub-THz communications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cache Content Placement in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning for Surface Defect Classification Under Data Heterogeneity in IIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15711</link>

Abstract: The challenge of data scarcity hinders the application of deep learning in industrial surface defect classification (SDC), as it's difficult to collect and centralize sufficient training data from various entities in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) provides a solution by enabling collaborative global model training across clients while maintaining privacy. However, performance may suffer due to data heterogeneity-discrepancies in data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL (PFL) approach, named Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning (AFedCL), for the challenge of data heterogeneity across different clients in SDC. First, we develop a dynamic consensus construction strategy to mitigate the performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity. Through adversarial training, local models from different clients utilize the global model as a bridge to achieve distribution alignment, alleviating the problem of global knowledge forgetting. Complementing this strategy, we propose a consensus-aware aggregation mechanism. It assigns aggregation weights to different clients based on their efficacy in global knowledge learning, thereby enhancing the global model's generalization capabilities. Finally, we design an adaptive feature fusion module to further enhance global knowledge utilization efficiency. Personalized fusion weights are gradually adjusted for each client to optimally balance global and local features. Compared with state-of-the-art FL methods like FedALA, the proposed AFedCL method achieves an accuracy increase of up to 5.67% on three SDC datasets.</description>

      <title>Equitable Federated Learning with Activation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a prominent distributed learning paradigm that incorporates collaboration among diverse clients, promotes data locality, and thus ensures privacy. These clients have their own technological, cultural, and other biases in the process of data generation. However, the present standard often ignores this bias/heterogeneity, perpetuating bias against certain groups rather than mitigating it. In response to this concern, we propose an equitable clustering-based framework where the clients are categorized/clustered based on how similar they are to each other. We propose a unique way to construct the similarity matrix that uses activation vectors. Furthermore, we propose a client weighing mechanism to ensure that each cluster receives equal importance and establish $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate of convergence to reach an $\epsilon-$stationary solution. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed strategy against common baselines, demonstrating its efficacy in terms of reducing the bias existing amongst various client clusters and consequently ameliorating algorithmic bias against specific groups.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.</description>
