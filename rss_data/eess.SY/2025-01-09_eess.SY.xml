      <title>Security by Design Issues in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous vehicle (AV) technology advances towards maturity, it becomes imperative to examine the security vulnerabilities within these cyber-physical systems. While conventional cyber-security concerns are often at the forefront of discussions, it is essential to get deeper into the various layers of vulnerability that are often overlooked within mainstream frameworks. Our goal is to spotlight imminent challenges faced by AV operators and explore emerging technologies for comprehensive solutions. This research outlines the diverse security layers, spanning physical, cyber, coding, and communication aspects, in the context of AVs. Furthermore, we provide insights into potential solutions for each potential attack vector, ensuring that autonomous vehicles remain secure and resilient in an evolving threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Spacecraft Servicing under Partial Feedback using Lyapunov-based Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04160v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly applied in space missions, including distributed space systems, resilient constellations, and autonomous rendezvous and docking operations. A critical emerging application is collaborative spacecraft servicing, which encompasses on-orbit maintenance, space debris removal, and swarm-based satellite repositioning. These missions involve servicing spacecraft interacting with malfunctioning or defunct spacecraft under challenging conditions, such as limited state information, measurement inaccuracies, and erratic target behaviors. Existing approaches often rely on assumptions of full state knowledge or single-integrator dynamics, which are impractical for real-world applications involving second-order spacecraft dynamics. This work addresses these challenges by developing a distributed state estimation and tracking framework that requires only relative position measurements and operates under partial state information. A novel $\rho$-filter is introduced to reconstruct unknown states using locally available information, and a Lyapunov-based deep neural network adaptive controller is developed that adaptively compensates for uncertainties stemming from unknown spacecraft dynamics. To ensure the collaborative spacecraft regulation problem is well-posed, a trackability condition is defined. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to ensure exponential convergence of errors in state estimation and spacecraft regulation to a neighborhood of the origin under the trackability condition. The developed method eliminates the need for expensive velocity sensors or extensive pre-training, offering a practical and robust solution for spacecraft servicing in complex, dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Online Mirror Descent for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distributed online nonconvex optimization problem with differential privacy over time-varying networks. Each node minimizes the sum of several nonconvex functions while preserving the node's differential privacy. We propose a privacy-preserving distributed online mirror descent algorithm for nonconvex optimization, which uses the mirror descent to update decision variables and the Laplace differential privacy mechanism to protect privacy. Unlike the existing works, the proposed algorithm allows the cost functions to be nonconvex, which is more applicable. Based upon these, we prove that if the communication network is $B$-strongly connected and the constraint set is compact, then by choosing the step size properly, the algorithm guarantees $\epsilon$-differential privacy at each time. Furthermore, we prove that if the local cost functions are $\beta$-smooth, then the regret over time horizon $T$ grows sublinearly while preserving differential privacy, with an upper bound $O(\sqrt{T})$. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-deterministic Channel Model for Underwater Acoustic Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a quasi-deterministic (Q-D) model for non-stationary underwater acoustic (UWA) channels is proposed. This model combines the BELLHOP deterministic model and geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM), which provides higher accuracy and flexibility. Different propagation components in shallow water are classified as D-rays, R-rays and F-rays in the proposed model, where D-rays are modeled by BELLHOP while both R-rays and F-rays are modeled by GBSM. Some important channel statistical properties, including time-frequency correlation function (TF-CF), Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), average Doppler shift, and RMS Doppler spread are derived and simulated. Finally, simulation results illustrate the correctness of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>A Novel Non-Stationary Channel Emulator for 6G MIMO Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance evaluation of sixth generation (6G) communication systems is anticipated to be a controlled and repeatable process in the lab, which brings up the demand for wireless channel emulators. However, channel emulation for 6G space-time-frequency (STF) non-stationary channels is missing currently. In this paper, a non-stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) that accurately characterizes the channel STF properties is introduced firstly. Then, a subspace-based method is proposed for reconstructing the channel fading obtained from the GBSM and a channel emulator architecture with frequency domain processing is presented for 6G MIMO systems. Moreover, the spatial time-varying channel transfer functions (CTFs) of the channel simulation and the channel emulation are compared and analyzed. The Doppler power spectral density (PSD) and delay PSD are further derived and compared between the channel model simulation and subspace-based emulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed channel emulator is capable of reproducing the non-stationary channel characteristics.</description>

      <title>Beam Domain Channel Estimation for Spatial Non-Stationary Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the channel estimation scheme is subject to the spatial non-stationarity and inevitably power leakage in the beam domain. In this paper, a beam domain channel estimation scheme is investigated for spatial non-stationary (SNS) massive MIMO systems considering power leakage. %a novel beam domain channel estimation scheme is proposed for spatial non-stationary (SNS) massive MIMO systems. Specifically, a realistic massive MIMO beam domain channel model (BDCM) is introduced to capture the spatial non-stationarity considering power leakage by introducing the illustration of visibility region (VR). Then, a beam domain structure-based sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (BDS-SAMP) scheme is proposed based on the cross-block sparse structure and power ratio threshold of beam domain channel. Finally, the simulation results validate the accuracy of proposed BDS-SAMP scheme with low pilot overhead and reasonable complexity by comparing with conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Target Tracking Using the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter with Numerical Differentiation for Estimating Curvature and Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of target tracking is to estimate target position, velocity, and acceleration in real time using position data. This paper introduces a novel target-tracking technique that uses adaptive input and state estimation (AISE) for real-time numerical differentiation to estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk from position data. These estimates are used to model the target motion within the Frenet-Serret (FS) frame. By representing the model in SE(3), the position and velocity are estimated using the invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF). The proposed method, called FS-IEKF-AISE, is illustrated by numerical examples and compared to prior techniques.</description>

      <title>Frenet-Serret-Based Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a crucial element of guidance, navigation, and control systems. This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Numerical Differentiation for Extremum Seeking with Sensor Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremum-seeking control (ESC) is widely used to optimize performance when the system dynamics are uncertain. However, sensitivity to sensor noise is an important issue in ESC implementation due to the use of high-pass filters or gradient estimators. To reduce the sensitivity of ESC to noise, this paper investigates the use of adaptive input and state estimation (AISE) for numerical differentiation. In particular, this paper develops extremum-seeking control with adaptive input and state estimation (ESC/AISE), where the high-pass filter of ESC is replaced by AISE to improve performance under sensor noise. The effectiveness of ESC/AISE is illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A new methodology for the optimization of bolt tightening sequences for ring type joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving uniform bolt load distribution is critical to obtain leak-free service in pressure vessel gasketed joints used in offshore pipelines. This is a difficult task due to bolt load variations during the assembly process. In this sense, the Elastic Interaction Coefficients Method has been developed in previous works to define tightening sequences that provide the target load at the end of the sequence in one or two passes. The method is very costly because a complete sequence must be simulated and the load of every bolt must be measured after each tightening operation. The present work validates this method for Ring Type Joints and further develops a numerically and experimentally validated new methodology that provides highly satisfactory results with a significantly lower cost.</description>

      <title>Integrating LLMs with ITS: Recent Advances, Potentials, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are crucial for the development and operation of smart cities, addressing key challenges in efficiency, productivity, and environmental sustainability. This paper comprehensively reviews the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in optimizing ITS. Initially, we provide an extensive overview of ITS, highlighting its components, operational principles, and overall effectiveness. We then delve into the theoretical background of various LLM techniques, such as GPT, T5, CTRL, and BERT, elucidating their relevance to ITS applications. Following this, we examine the wide-ranging applications of LLMs within ITS, including traffic flow prediction, vehicle detection and classification, autonomous driving, traffic sign recognition, and pedestrian detection. Our analysis reveals how these advanced models can significantly enhance traffic management and safety. Finally, we explore the challenges and limitations LLMs face in ITS, such as data availability, computational constraints, and ethical considerations. We also present several future research directions and potential innovations to address these challenges. This paper aims to guide researchers and practitioners through the complexities and opportunities of integrating LLMs in ITS, offering a roadmap to create more efficient, sustainable, and responsive next-generation transportation systems.</description>

      <title>New Linear Model of a Composite Energy Storage System with Realizable Dispatch Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To optimize battery dispatch, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory and ensure dispatch is admissible (i.e., does not lead to unexpected SOC saturation). But battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we consider a composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while ensuring admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis: a control perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04572v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online learning and model reference adaptive control have many interesting intersections. One area where they differ however is in how the algorithms are analyzed and what objective or metric is used to discriminate "good" algorithms from "bad" algorithms. In adaptive control there are usually two objectives: 1) prove that all time varying parameters/states of the system are bounded, and 2) that the instantaneous error between the adaptively controlled system and a reference system converges to zero over time (or at least a compact set). For online learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the regret the algorithm incurs. Regret is defined as the cumulative loss (cost) over time from the online algorithm minus the cumulative loss (cost) of the single optimal fixed parameter choice in hindsight. Another significant difference between the two areas of research is with regard to the assumptions made in order to obtain said results. Adaptive control makes assumptions about the input-output properties of the control problem and derives solutions for a fixed error model or optimization task. In the online learning literature results are derived for classes of loss functions (i.e. convex) while a priori assuming that all time varying parameters are bounded, which for many optimization tasks is not unrealistic, but is a non starter in control applications. In this work we discuss these differences in detail through the regret based analysis of gradient descent for convex functions and the control based analysis of a streaming regression problem. We close with a discussion about the newly defined paradigm of online adaptive control and ask the following question "Are regret optimal control strategies deployable?"</description>

      <title>Large-scale Grid Optimization: The Workhorse of Future Grid Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The computation methods for modeling, controlling and optimizing the transforming grid are evolving rapidly. We review and systemize knowledge for a special class of computation methods that solve large-scale power grid optimization problems. Summary: Large-scale grid optimizations are pertinent for, amongst other things, hedging against risk due to resource stochasticity, evaluating aggregated DERs' impact on grid operation and design, and improving the overall efficiency of grid operation in terms of cost, reliability, and carbon footprint. We attribute the continual growth in scale and complexity of grid optimizations to a large influx of new spatial and temporal features in both transmission (T) and distribution (D) networks. Therefore, to systemize knowledge in the field, we discuss the recent advancements in T and D systems from the viewpoint of mechanistic physics-based and emerging data-driven methods. Findings: We find that while mechanistic physics-based methods are leading the science in solving large-scale grid optimizations, data-driven techniques, especially physics-constrained ones, are emerging as an alternative to solve otherwise intractable problems. We also find observable gaps in the field and ascertain these gaps from the paper's literature review and by collecting and synthesizing feedback from industry experts.</description>

      <title>Bridging Impulse Control of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes and Markov Decision Processes: Frameworks, Extensions, and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control theory plays a pivotal role in understanding and optimizing the behavior of complex dynamical systems across various scientific and engineering disciplines. Two key frameworks that have emerged for modeling and solving control problems in stochastic systems are piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Each framework has its unique strengths, and their intersection offers promising opportunities for tackling a broad class of problems, particularly in the context of impulse controls and decision-making in complex systems.
  The relationship between PDMPs and MDPs is a natural subject of exploration, as embedding impulse control problems for PDMPs into the MDP framework could open new avenues for their analysis and resolution. Specifically, this integration would allow leveraging the computational and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to address the challenges inherent in PDMPs. On the other hand, PDMPs can offer a versatile and simple paradigm to model continuous time problems that are often described as discrete-time MDPs parametrized by complex transition kernels. This transformation has the potential to bridge the gap between the two frameworks, enabling solutions to previously intractable problems and expanding the scope of both fields. This paper presents a comprehensive review of two research domains, illustrated through a recurring medical example. The example is revisited and progressively formalized within the framework of thevarious concepts and objects introduced</description>

      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning with Minimal Supervision</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in the real world necessitates the development of procedures that enable agents to explore without causing harm to themselves or others. The most successful solutions to the problem of safe RL leverage offline data to learn a safe-set, enabling safe online exploration. However, this approach to safe-learning is often constrained by the demonstrations that are available for learning.
  In this paper we investigate the influence of the quantity and quality of data used to train the initial safe learning problem offline on the ability to learn safe-RL policies online. Specifically, we focus on tasks with spatially extended goal states where we have few or no demonstrations available. Classically this problem is addressed either by using hand-designed controllers to generate data or by collecting user-generated demonstrations. However, these methods are often expensive and do not scale to more complex tasks and environments. To address this limitation we propose an unsupervised RL-based offline data collection procedure, to learn complex and scalable policies without the need for hand-designed controllers or user demonstrations. Our research demonstrates the significance of providing sufficient demonstrations for agents to learn optimal safe-RL policies online, and as a result, we propose optimistic forgetting, a novel online safe-RL approach that is practical for scenarios with limited data. Further, our unsupervised data collection approach highlights the need to balance diversity and optimality for safe online exploration.</description>

      <title>Recursive Least Squares with Fading Regularization for Finite-Time Convergence without Persistent Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends recursive least squares (RLS) to include time-varying regularization. This extension provides flexibility for updating the least squares regularization term in real time. Existing results with constant regularization imply that the parameter-estimation error dynamics of RLS are globally attractive to zero if and only the regressor is weakly persistently exciting. This work shows that, by extending classical RLS to include a time-varying (fading) regularization term that converges to zero, the parameter-estimation error dynamics are globally attractive to zero without weakly persistent excitation. Moreover, if the fading regularization term converges to zero in finite time, then the parameter estimation error also converges to zero in finite time. Finally, we propose rank-1 fading regularization (R1FR) RLS, a time-varying regularization algorithm with fading regularization that converges to zero, and which runs in the same computational complexity as classical RLS. Numerical examples are presented to validate theoretical guarantees and to show how R1FR-RLS can protect against over-regularization.</description>

      <title>A capacity renting framework for shared energy storage considering peer-to-peer energy trading of prosumers with privacy protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared energy storage systems (ESS) present a promising solution to the temporal imbalance between energy generation from renewable distributed generators (DGs) and the power demands of prosumers. However, as DG penetration rates rise, spatial energy imbalances become increasingly significant, necessitating the integration of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading within the shared ESS framework. Two key challenges emerge in this context: the absence of effective mechanisms and the greater difficulty for privacy protection due to increased data communication. This research proposes a capacity renting framework for shared ESS considering P2P energy trading of prosumers. In the proposed framework, prosumers can participate in P2P energy trading and rent capacities from shared ESS. A generalized Nash game is formulated to model the trading process and the competitive interactions among prosumers, and the variational equilibrium of the game is proved to be equivalent to the optimal solution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem. To address the privacy protection concern, the problem is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with the Paillier cryptosystem. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the impact of P2P energy trading on the shared ESS framework and validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Robustness and Fragility of Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coincident peak demand charges are imposed by power system operators or electric utilities when the overall system demand, aggregated across multiple consumers, reaches its peak. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce their demand during peak periods, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. In this paper, we analyze the coincident peak shaving problem through the lens of game theory, developing a theoretical model to examine the impact of strategic consumer behavior on system efficiency. We demonstrate that the game structure exhibits varying characteristics - concave, quasiconcave/discontinuous, or non-concave/discontinuous - depending on the extent of consumers demand-shifting capabilities. For a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions under each condition and generalize our findings to cases with multiple agents. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and present an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes across all game scenarios. We also show that the peak-shaving effectiveness of the game model matches that of the centralized peak-shaving model but with increased levels of anarchy. In the cases of quasiconcave and non-concave game conditions, we analytically demonstrate in the two-agent setting that anarchy increases with consumers' flexibility and inequity, as measured by their marginal shifting costs, and we also analyze the influence of the number of agents on anarchy. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Entropy-regularized Diffusion Policy with Q-Ensembles for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents advanced techniques of training diffusion policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL). At the core is a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE) that transfers a complex action distribution into a standard Gaussian and then samples actions conditioned on the environment state with a corresponding reverse-time SDE, like a typical diffusion policy. We show that such an SDE has a solution that we can use to calculate the log probability of the policy, yielding an entropy regularizer that improves the exploration of offline datasets. To mitigate the impact of inaccurate value functions from out-of-distribution data points, we further propose to learn the lower confidence bound of Q-ensembles for more robust policy improvement. By combining the entropy-regularized diffusion policy with Q-ensembles in offline RL, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks in D4RL benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/ruoqizzz/Entropy-Regularized-Diffusion-Policy-with-QEnsemble.</description>
