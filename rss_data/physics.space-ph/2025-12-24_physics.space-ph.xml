      <title>Verification of the Outer Space Treaty with Cosmic Protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Outer Space Treaty (OST) was opened to signatures in 1967, and since then 117 countries, including China, the United States, Russia, have become part of it. Among other stipulations the treaty bans the placement of nuclear weapons in outer space. Recently the US government has raised worries that Russia is testing nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) components, with the possibility that it will place a nuclear weapon in space. Such a device, if detonated, would destroy most of the satellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This danger is compounded by the lack of a verification mechanism for the OST. No methodologies of verification have been proposed in the open peer reviewed literature. This study presents a concept and a feasibility study for verifying a satellite's compliance to the OST by observing the neutrons induced by spallation from the $\sim$GeV protons in the inner Van Allen radiation belts. The calculations show that a 9U CubeSat sized detection platform can identify a thermonuclear weapon from the distance of 4 km in approximately one week of observation. This conceptual study will stimulate and inform future research and development of verification platforms for OST.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'enic solar wind intervals observed by Solar Orbiter: Exploiting the capability of the SWA plasma suite and source region investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and slow solar wind have distinct properties linked to their solar sources.Alfv\'enic slow wind complicates the usual speed-based classification, especially at intermediate speeds. Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfv\'enic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfv\'enic streams: one fast wind, three Alfv\'enic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfv\'enicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfv\'enic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfv\'enic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfv\'enicity relates to the solar source conditions.</description>
