      <title>Thermally activated dynamics of annealed glasses near the yielding transition under cyclic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While experiments and simulations have provided a rich picture of the dynamic heterogeneity in glasses at constant temperature or under steady shear, the dynamics of glasses under oscillatory shear remain comparatively less explored. Recent work has shown that oscillatory shear protocols can embed a ``memory'' into a glass's structure, whereby the material will exhibit dynamics that are encoded by the oscillatory shear protocol applied. However, most of the computational work studying the memory effect has been performed in the zero temperature limit, and the effects of thermalization are poorly characterized. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of a model two-dimensional glass former at low, non-zero temperatures under oscillatory shear. While we show that the systems' dynamics are independent of sample preparation for either small or larger strain amplitudes, the dynamics become distinct near the yield point when the deformation is applied at finite temperature. We then characterize the dynamic heterogeneity using two metrics, one derived from the vibrational modes and one that exploits machine learning to identify regions prone to rearrangement. This analysis provides evidence that the dynamics below and above yield emerge from distinct structural origins that may be important for developing improved constitutive models that can predict memory in disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Stochastic Non-Equilibrium Thermal Effects of Particle Inclusions within Fluid Interfaces and Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate theoretical modeling approaches and develop practical computational simulation methods for investigating the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of fluid interfaces with passive and active immersed particles. Our approaches capture phenomena taking into account thermal and dissipative energy exchanges, hydrodynamic coupling, and correlated spontaneous fluctuations. Our methods allow for modeling non-uniform time-varying temperature fields, fluid momentum fields, and their impacts on particle drift-diffusion dynamics. We show how practical stochastic numerical methods can be developed for these systems by performing analysis to factor operators analytically to obtain efficient algorithms for generating the fluctuating fields. We demonstrate our methods in a few simulation studies showing how they can be used to capture particle heating of the interface and the roles of thermal gradients on hydrodynamic fluctuations. The methods developed provide modeling and simulation approaches that can be used for further investigations of non-equilibrium phenomena in active soft materials, complex fluids, and biophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Organization and Dynamics of Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How long threadlike eukaryotic chromosomes fit tidily in the small volume of the nucleus without significant entanglement is just beginning to be understood, thanks to major advances in experimental techniques. Several polymer models, which reproduce contact maps that measure the probabilities that two loci are in spatial contact, have predicted the three-dimensional structures of interphase chromosomes. Data-driven approaches, using contact maps as input, predict that mitotic helical chromosomes are characterized by switch in handedness, referred to as "perversion". By using experimentally derived effective interactions between chromatin loci in simulations, structures of conventional and inverted nuclei have been accurately predicted. Polymer theory and simulations show that the dynamics of individual loci in chromatin exhibit subdiffusive behavior but the diffusion exponents are broadly distributed, which accords well with experiments. Although coarse-grained models are successful, many challenging problems remain, which require the creation of new experimental and computational tools to understand genome biology.</description>

      <title>Polymer dynamics under tension: mean first passage time for looping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study deals with polymer looping, an important process in many chemical and biological systems. We investigate basic questions on the looping dynamics of a polymer under tension using the freely-jointed chain (FJC) model. Previous theoretical approaches to polymer looping under tension have relied on barrier escape methods, which assume local equilibrium, an assumption that may not always hold. As a starting point we use an analytical expression for the equilibrium looping probability as a function of the number of monomers and applied force, predicting an inverse relationship between looping time and looping probability. Using molecular dynamics simulations the predictions of this theoretical approach are validated within the numerical precision achieved. We compare our predictions to those of the barrier escape approach, by way of a calculation of the mean first passage time (MFPT) for the ends of a polymer to cross. For this purpose, we derive the exact free energy landscape, but resulting temporal predictions do not agree with the observed inverse scaling. We conclude that the traditional barrier escape approach does not provide satisfactory predictions for polymer looping dynamics and that the inverse scaling with looping probability offers a more reliable alternative.</description>

      <title>Cascades and Kolmogorov's lognormal scaling in two-dimensional bacterial turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective movements of bacteria exhibit a remarkable pattern of turbulence-like vortices, in which the Richardson cascade plays an important role. In this work, we examine the energy and enstrophy cascades and their associated lognormal statistics using experimental velocity field data. The coherent structure observed on a large scale is due to the presence of the inverse energy cascade; while the kinetic energy is dissipated at all scales, since these active movements occur below the fluid viscosity scale. The forward enstrophy cascade occurs with injection at all scales and may be represented by other nonlinear interactions that are not captured by the existing experimental data. Furthermore, the lognormal statistics for both energy dissipation and enstrophy fields are verified in accordance with the Kolmogorov 1962 refined theory of turbulence. Their scaling exponents can be well described by the lognormal formula with intermittency parameters comparable with those of the three-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence. The joint analysis of the multifractal measures of the energy dissipation rate and enstrophy follows an ellipse model from the lognormal statistics. Our results confirm the coexistence of the inverse energy cascade and the intermittency correction of the velocity scaling in this active fluid system. An inverse energy cascade diagram below the fluid viscosity is summarized to describe the observed two-dimensional bacterial turbulence. Our work provides an example of an active-flow model benchmark.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of the flexural Ising model in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the compressible Ising model in which spins are hosted on an elastic $D$-dimensional lattice embedded in $d&gt;D$ dimensions is studied. Two critical systems interact when temperature is tuned to the Ising transition point, as a freely-fluctuating thermalized crystalline membrane in its flat phase is already critical. Noting that the upper critical dimension of both the membrane and Ising model is $D_{uc}=4$, renormalization group recursion relations are found by expanding in $\epsilon=4-D$. The coupling between spin and elastic degrees of freedom is shown to be a relevant operator for the physical case of a two-dimensional membrane fluctuating in three-dimensional space ($D=2$, $d=3$), which suggests that the thermalized membrane and Ising systems become more strongly coupled at long wavelengths. The coupling is irrelevant when the difference between the space dimension and membrane dimension is greater than twelve.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the power spectral density of a fluctuating colloidal current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of molecules through biological and synthetic nanopores is governed by multiple stochastic processes that lead to noisy, fluctuating currents. Disentangling the characteristics of different noise-generating mechanisms is central to better understanding molecular transport at a fundamental level but is extremely challenging in molecular systems, due to their complexity and relative experimental inaccessibility. Here, we construct a colloidal model microfluidic system for the experimental measurement of particle currents, where the governing physical properties are directly controllable and particle dynamics directly observable, unlike in the molecular case. Currents of hard spheres fluctuate due to the random arrival times of particles into the channel and the distribution of particle speeds within the channel, which results in characteristic scalings in the power spectral density. We rationalise these scalings by quantitatively comparing to a model for shot noise with a finite transit time, extended to include the distribution of particle speeds. Particle velocity distributions sensitively reflect the confining geometry and we interpret and model these in terms of the underlying fluid flow profiles. Finally, we explore the extent to which details of these distributions govern the form of the resulting power spectral density, thereby establishing concrete links between the power spectral density and underlying mechanisms for this experimental system. This paves the way for establishing a more systematic understanding of the links between characteristics of transport fluctuations and underlying molecular mechanisms in driven systems such as nanopores.</description>

      <title>Viologen-based supramolecular crystal gels: gelation kinetics and sensitivity to temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supramolecular crystal gels, a subset of molecular gels, form through self-assembly of low molecular weight gelators into interconnecting crystalline fibers, creating a three-dimensional soft solid network. This study focuses on the formation and properties of viologen-based supramolecular crystalline gels. It aims to answer key questions about the tunability of network properties and the origin of these properties through in-depth analyses of the gelation kinetics triggered by thermal quenching. Experimental investigations, including UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, rheology, microscopy and scattering measurements, contribute to a comprehensive and self-consistent understanding of the system kinetics. We confirm that the viologen-based gelators crystallize by forming nanometer radius hollow tube that assemble into micro to millimetric spherulites. We then show that the crystallization follows the Avrami theory and is based on pre-existing nuclei. We also establish that the growth is interface controlled leading to the hollow tubes to branch into spherulites with fractal structures. Finally, we demonstrate that the gel properties can be tuned depending on the quenching temperature. Lowering the temperature results in the formation of denser and smaller spherulites. In contrast, the gels elasticity is not significantly affected by the quench temperature, leading us to hypothesize that the spherulites densification occurs at the expense of the connectivity between spherulite.</description>
