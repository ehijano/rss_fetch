      <title>Modeling of Injected Current Stream-Induced 3D Perturbations in Local Helicity Injection Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solenoid-free tokamak startup techniques are essential for spherical tokamaks and offer a pathway to cost reduction and design simplification in fusion energy systems. Local helicity injection (LHI) is one such approach, employing compact edge current sources to drive open field line current that initiates and sustains tokamak plasmas. The recently commissioned Pegasus-III spherical tokamak provides a platform for advancing this and other solenoid-free startup methods. This study investigates the effect of LHI on magnetic topology in Pegasus-III plasmas. A helical filament model represents the injected current, and the linear plasma response to its 3D field is calculated with M3D-C1. Poincar\'e mapping reveals substantial flux surface degradation in all modeled cases. The onset of overlapping magnetic structures and large-scale surface deformation begins at $\Psi_{N} \approx 0.37$, indicating a broad region of perturbed topology extending toward the edge. In rotating plasmas, both single-fluid and two-fluid models exhibit partial screening of the $n = 1$ perturbation, with two-fluid calculations showing stronger suppression near the edge. In contrast, the absence of rotation leads to strong resonant field amplification in the single-fluid case, while the two-fluid case with zero electron rotation mitigates this amplification and preserves edge screening. Magnetic probe measurements indicate that modeling the stream with spatial spreading$-$representing distributed current and/or oscillatory motion$-$better reproduces measured magnetic power profiles than a rigid filament model. The results underscore the role of rotation and two-fluid physics in screening stream perturbations and point to plasma flow measurements and refined stream models as key steps toward improving predictive fidelity.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic turbulence in EAST plasmas with internal transport barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, global nonlinear electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations are conducted to investigate turbulence in the Internal transport barrier (ITB) region of the EAST tokamak discharge with weakly reversed magnetic shear. Linear simulations reveal two dominant ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes: a higher frequency mode at the $q=1$ surface, which dominates in the electrostatic limit, and a lower frequency mode near the $q_{\min}$ surface, which prevails under the experimental $\beta$ (the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure). Finite $\beta$ effects effectively suppress higher frequency ITG modes, and once $\beta_i$ on axis exceeds 0.5\%, this ITG mode is no longer dominant, and the ITG mode near $q_{\min}$ surface becomes the primary instability. Therefore, electromagnetic effects play a crucial role in stabilizing ITG modes, and in causing the transition between the most unstable mode at different radial positions. The linear growth rate of the unstable mode in the electrostatic limit is approximately 1.25 times higher than that of the dominant mode in the electromagnetic case. However, in the electromagnetic nonlinear regime, the thermal ion heat conductivity is reduced by at least a factor of 4. This reduction primarily results from nonlinear electromagnetic effects enhancing the shearing effect of zonal flows, thereby further suppressing microturbulence. Finally, energetic particles exert a slight stabilizing effect on ITG turbulence due to dilution and finite $\beta$ contributions. It is emphasized that the electromagnetic effect on ITG with weak magnetic shear should be included to accurately calculate the transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale Interaction between Microturbulence and Fishbone in Fusion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global gyrokinetic simulations are performed for the first time to investigate cross-scale interactions between electromagnetic ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence and fishbone instability in tokamak plasmas. The investigation of fluctuation response in the multiscale simulation including both instabilities indicates a strong impact of fishbone on ITG turbulence. Detailed analysis reveals that fishbone-driven zonal radial electric fields at nonlinear saturation significantly suppress electromagnetic ITG turbulence, reducing ion thermal transport close to the neoclassical level. The simulation results agree well with experimental observations that turbulence suppression during fishbone bursts. These findings advance understanding of multiscale interactions that enhance thermal confinement in fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>Stochastic simulation of partial discharge inception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo method for simulating the inception of electric discharges in gases. The input consists of an unstructured grid containing the electrostatic field. The output of the model is the estimated probability of discharge inception per initial electron position, as well as the estimated time lag between the appearance of the initial electron and discharge inception. To obtain these quantities electron avalanches are simulated for initial electron positions throughout the whole domain, also including regions below the critical electric field. Avalanches are assumed to propagate along field lines, and they can produce additional avalanches due to photon and ion feedback. If the number of avalanches keeps increasing over time we assume that an electric discharge will eventually form. A statistical distribution for the electron avalanche size is used, which is also valid for gases with strong electron attachment. We compare this distribution against the results of particle simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate examples of inception simulations in 2D Cartesian, 2D axisymmetric and 3D electrode geometries.</description>

      <title>Lightning-Induced Faults in Low-Voltage Distribution Networks via Hybrid VTS-PEEC Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a critical component of power supply systems, low-voltage distribution net-works directly affect grid stability and user power supply reliability, yet they face significant threats from lightning-induced faults. Transient simulations are more economical and adaptable for investigating lightning-induced faults in low-voltage distribution networks than experiments. A hybrid Variable Time Step (VTS)-Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method, has been validat-ed in previous study, is used for Lightning-induced Electromagnetic Pulse (LEMP) simulation and fault analysis. The lightning-induced faults in ex-tended unequal-length double-circuit low-voltage distribution networks are ana-lyzed in this paper. The impact of lightning stroke location on overvoltage and fault risk is the primary focus of this study. Key findings indicate that, for ground strokes in front of the center of one double circuit, similar three-phase negative and bipolar oscillatory waveforms that are linked to fault initiation emerge. Closer strokes promote bipolar waveforms with the main peak negative as well as higher overvoltages and fault risk. These results provide essential insights for under-standing lightning-induced fault mechanisms, thereby laying a foundation for formulating more targeted and effective lightning protection measures.</description>

      <title>Approaching the thermodynamic limit of a bounded one-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical one-component plasma (OCP) bounded by a spherical surface reflecting ions (BOCP) is studied using molecular dynamics (MD). Simulations performed for a series of sufficiently large BOCP's make it possible to establish the size dependencies for the investigated quantities and extrapolate them to the thermodynamic limit. In particular, the total electrostatic energy per ion is estimated in the limit of infinite BOCP in a wide range of the Coulomb coupling parameter $\Gamma$ from 0.03 to 1000 with the relative error of the order 0.1%. Calculated energies are by about 0.5% lower as compared to the modern Monte Carlo (MC) simulation data obtained by different authors at $\Gamma&lt;30$ and almost coincide with the MC results at $\Gamma&gt;175$. We introduce two more converging characteristic energies, the excess interatomic electrostatic energy and the excess ion-background electrostatic energy, which enable us to calculate the ionic compressibility factor inaccessible in conventional MC and MD simulation of the OCP with periodic boundary conditions. The derived wide-range ionic equation of state can be recommended for testing OCP simulations with various effective interaction potentials. Based on this equation, we propose an improved cutoff radius for the interionic forces implemented in LAMMPS and perform MD simulation of the OCP to demonstrate that location of the metastable region of the fluid-solid phase transition depends sensitively on this radius.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic plasma wave modes propagating along light-cone coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new electromagnetic plasma modes that propagates in one time and one space coordinates. Differently to the usual plane wave solution, which is written in terms of separation of variables, all our solutions are along the light-cone coordinates. This allow us to find several new wavepacket solutions whose functionality properties rely on the conditions imposed on the choice for their light-cone coordinates dependence. The presented wavepacket solutions are constructed in terms of multiplications of Airy functions, Parabolic cylinder functions, Mathieu functions, or Bessel functions. We thoroughly analyze the case of a double Airy solution, which have new electromagnetic properties, as a defined wavefront, and velocity faster than the electromagnetic plane wave counterpart solution. It is also mentioned how more general structured wavepackets can be constructed from these new solutions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Electron-Scale Turbulence Modeling in W7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing reduced models for turbulent transport is essential for accelerating profile predictions and enabling many-query tasks such as uncertainty quantification, parameter scans, and design optimization. This paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\eta_e$), and the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\tau$). We first construct models across seven radial locations using regression and an active machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\%$ prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent modeling and simulation of two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a rigorous thermodynamic framework, this work develops a two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic model grounded in the Helmholtz free energy formalism. The model maintains full thermodynamic consistency by simultaneously satisfying energy conservation and entropy production laws in two-fluid systems. By analyzing the convex-concave structure of the Helmholtz free energy density, we systematically derive key thermodynamic variables-chemical potential, entropy density, and internal energy-in a self-consistent manner. Building on this foundation, we construct a temporally discrete numerical scheme that inherits the thermodynamic consistency of the continuous model. The scheme is proven to adhere rigorously to both the first and second laws of thermodynamics. For the implemented two-dimensional degenerate system, we establish comprehensive a priori error estimates in space and time. Numerical simulations validate the model's effectiveness in capturing essential plasma phenomena, demonstrating its applicability to complex physical scenarios.</description>

      <title>High Gain Fusion Target Design using Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By returning to the topological basics of fusion target design, Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) is used to specify how to initially configure and drive the optimally entangled topological state, and stabilize that topological state from disruption. This can be applied to all methods; including tokamaks, laser-driven schemes, and pulsed-power driven schemes. The result is practical, room temperature targets that can yield up to 10 GJ of energy, driven by as little as 3 MJ of absorbed energy. The genAI is based on the concept of Ubuntu that replaces the Deep Convolutional Neural Network approximation of a functional, with the formula for the generating functional of a canonical transformation from the domain of the canonical field momentums and fields, to the domain of the canonical momentums and coordinates, that is the Reduced Order Model. This formula is a logical process of renormalization, enabling Heisenberg's canonical approach to field theory, via calculation of the S-matrix, given observation of the fields. This can be viewed as topological characterization and control of collective, that is complex, systems.</description>

      <title>Coronal hole picoflare jets are progenitors of both fast and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of this wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations reveal intermittent jets, with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to solar wind have not been established. Here, we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft that establish a unified picture of fast and Alfv\'{e}nic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Vacuum Breakdown in High-Field Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review consolidates experimental, theoretical, and simulation work examining the behavior of high-field devices and the fundamental process of vacuum arc initiation, commonly referred to as breakdown. Detailed experimental observations and results relating to a wide range of aspects of high-field devices, including conditioning, field and temperature dependence of breakdown rate, and the ability to sustain high electric fields as a function of device geometry and materials, are presented. The different observations are then addressed theoretically, and with simulation, capturing the sequence of processes that lead to vacuum breakdown and explaining the major observed experimental dependencies. The core of the work described in this review was carried out by a broad multi-disciplinary collaboration in an over a decade-long program to develop high-gradient, 100 MV/m-range, accelerating structures for the CLIC project, a possible future linear-collider high-energy physics facility. Connections are made to the broader linear collider, high-field, and breakdown communities.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>
