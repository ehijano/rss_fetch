      <title>Phase-Field Modeling of Border Cell Cluster Migration in Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective cell migration is a fundamental biological process that drives events such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. In this study, we develop a biophysically informed phase-field model to investigate the collective migration of the border cell cluster in the Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber. Our model captures key aspects of the egg chamber architecture, including the oocyte, nurse cells, and surrounding epithelium, and incorporates both mechanical forces and biochemical cues that guide cell migration. We introduce the Tangential Interface Migration (TIM) force which captures contact-mediated propulsion generated along interfaces between the border cell cluster and surrounding nurse cells. Our simulations reveal three key features of TIM-driven migration that distinguish it from previous forms of chemotaxis: (1) the necessity of border cell-nurse cell overlap to initiate movement (i.e., border cells cannot move without a nurse cell substrate), (2) motion is tangential to border cell-nurse cell interfaces, and (3) persistent migration even in regions where the spatial slope of chemoattractant is decreasing. Additionally, we demonstrate that with or without geometry-mediated alterations in chemoattractant distribution such as at intercellular junctions we can vary induced migration pauses, independent of mechanical confinement. We capture an experimentally observed transition to dorsal migration at the oocyte with a sustained medio-lateral chemical cue of small amplitude. The results show how spatial constraints and interfacial forces shape collective cell movement and highlight the utility of phase-field models in capturing the interplay between tissue geometry, contact forces, and chemical signaling.</description>

      <title>MicroLabVR: Interactive 3D Visualization of Simulated Spatiotemporal Microbiome Data in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease. Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results. To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome data in their spatial context.</description>
