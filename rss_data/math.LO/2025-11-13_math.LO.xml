      <title>A General Theorem for Non-Simultaneous Hat Guessing Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prisoners and hats puzzle, or simply the hat puzzle, is a family of games in which a group of prisoners are each assigned a colored hat and are asked to guess the color of their own hat. Various versions of the puzzle arise depending on the number of prisoners, the number of possible hat colors, and the information available to them before and after the game begins. These puzzles are broadly classified according to whether the prisoners' declarations are made simultaneously or non-simultaneously. In this paper we present a general theorem concerning the existence of a winning strategy when the declarations are non-simultaneous. We also discuss the relationship between the construction of such strategies and the Axiom of Choice, as well as their connection to the simultaneous-declaration case.</description>

      <title>Stability, corners, and other 2-dimensional shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a relaxation of stability, called almost sure stability, which is insensitive to perturbations by subsets of Loeb measure $0$ in a non-standard finite group. We show that almost sure stability satisfies a stationarity principle in the sense of geometric stability theory for measure independent elements. We apply this principle to deduce the existence of squares in dense almost surely stable subsets of Cartesian products of non-standard finite groups, possibly non-abelian. Our results imply qualitative asymptotic versions for Cartesian products of finite groups. In the final section, we establish the existence of $3\times 2$-grids (and thus of $L$-shapes) in dense almost surely stable $2$-dimensional subsets of finite abelian groups of odd order.</description>

      <title>Binding groups for algebraic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A binding group theorem is proved in the context of quantifier-free internality to the fixed field in difference-closed fields of characteristic zero. This is articulated as a statement about the birational geometry of isotrivial algebraic dynamical systems, and more generally isotrivial $\sigma$-varieties. It asserts that if $(V,\phi)$ is an isotrivial $\sigma$-variety then a certain subgroup of the group of birational transformations of $V$, namely those that preserve all the relations between $(V,\phi)$ and the trivial dynamics on the affine line, is in fact an algebraic group. Several application are given including new special cases of the Zariski Dense Orbit Conjecture and the Dixmier-Moeglin Equivalence Problem in algebraic dynamics, as well as finiteness results about the existence of nonconstant invariant rational functions on cartesian powers of $\sigma$-varieties. These applications give algebraic-dynamical analogues of recent results in differential-algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Proper Homotopy Equivalence of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the proper homotopy equivalence relation for locally finite graphs is Borel complete. Furthermore, among the infinite graphs, there is a comeager equivalence class. As corollaries, we obtain the analogous results for the homeomorphism relation of noncompact surfaces with pants decompositions.</description>

      <title>A Solovay-like model at $\aleph_\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the consistency of ZFC with appropriate large cardinal axioms we produce a model of ZFC where $\aleph_\omega$ is a strong limit cardinal and the inner model $L(\mathcal{P}(\aleph_\omega))$ satisfies the following properties: (1) Every set $A\subseteq (\aleph_\omega)^\omega$ has the $\aleph_\omega$-PSP. (2) There is no scale at $\aleph_\omega$. (3) The Singular Cardinal Hypothesis (SCH) fails at $\aleph_\omega$. (4) Shelah's Approachability property (AP) fails at $\aleph_\omega$. (5) The Tree Property (TP) holds at $\aleph_{\omega+1}$. The above provides the first example of a Solovay-type model at the level of the first singular cardinal, $\aleph_\omega$. Our model also answers, in the context of ZF+$\mathrm{DC}_{\aleph_\omega}$, a well-known question by Woodin on the relationship between the SCH and the AP at $\aleph_\omega$.</description>

      <title>A discrete-time temporal deontic STIT logic based on interpreted systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a STIT ('see to it that') logic with discrete temporal operators and deontic operators in which we can formalize and reason about legal concepts such as persistent duty and the dynamic concept of power from Hohfeld. As our main technical contribution, we show that this logic is sound and complete with respect to the semantics based on interpreted systems and is decidable.</description>

      <title>Advancing mathematics research with generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>
