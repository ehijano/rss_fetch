      <title>Causal Perturbative Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the general framework of perturbative quantum field theory for the general Yang-Mills model including massless and massive vector fields and also scalar and Dirac fields. We describe the chronological products using Wick submonomials and give rigorous proofs of gauge invariance for tree and loop contributions in the second order of the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking from Monopole Condensation in QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QED in three dimensions with an $SU(2)_f$ doublet $\psi^i$ of massless, charge-1 Dirac fermions (and no Chern-Simons term) has a $U(2) = (SU(2)_f \times U(1)_m)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that acts on gauge-invariant local operators, including monopole operators charged under $U(1)_m$. We establish that there are only two possible IR scenarios: either the theory flows to a CFT with $U(2)$ symmetry (a scenario strongly constrained by conformal bootstrap bounds); or it spontaneously breaks $U(2) \to U(1)$ via the condensation of a monopole operator of smallest $U(1)_m$ charge, which is a $U(2)$ doublet. This leads to three Nambu-Goldstone bosons described by a sigma model into a squashed three-sphere $S^3$ with $U(2)$ isometry. We further show that the conventional $SU(2)_f$-triplet order parameter $i \bar \psi \vec \sigma \, \psi$ also gets a vev, exactly aligned with the monopole vev, such that the triplet parametrizes the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ base of the $S^3$ Hopf bundle, with the monopoles providing the $S^1$ fibers. We also recall why this scenario is compatible with the Vafa-Witten theorem. We obtain these results by analyzing the phase diagram as a function of the fermion triplet mass $\vec m$: we show that for all $\vec m \neq 0$ there is a Coulomb phase with only a weakly-coupled photon at low energies, arising from a monopole vev that is aligned with $\vec m$ via the Hopf map. We then argue that taking $\vec m \to 0$ leads to the symmetry-breaking scenario above. Throughout, we give a detailed account of anomaly matching, which leads to a $\theta=\pi$ term in the $S^3$ sigma model. In one presentation, it can be understood as a Hopf term in a suitably gauged version of the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model.</description>

      <title>End of the World Brane Dynamics in Holographic 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SU(N) with 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills on half-space with boundary conditions defined by configurations of Gaiotto-Witten NS5- and D5-branes modded out by a rotated orientifold 5-plane breaking an extra half of the supersymmetries. We focus on configurations in which this O5'-brane is split by an NS5-brane into two oppositely charged halves, leading to a breaking of supersymmetry down to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ at the local level. The 5-brane configurations turn into non-trivial $(p,q)$ webs and lead to non-trivial brane and gauge theory phenomena, including a 5d $\mathbf{Z}_2$ global gauge anomaly cancelled by a novel 6d global anomaly inflow, and the appearance of localized 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons couplings and the 3d parity anomaly at the boundary of the 4d theory. The systems have explicit gravity duals, given by orientifolds of the AdS$_4\times\mathbf{S}^2\times\mathbf{S}^2$ fibrations over a Riemann surface dual to the Gaiotto-Witten setups. They describe solutions with an asymptotic AdS$_5\times\mathbf{S}^5$ terminating at AdS$_4$ End of the World boundary configurations, whose rich dynamics reproduces the above physical properties. They also provide the SymTFT of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ on half-space with a new class of boundary conditions. We explore the interplay of bulk and boundary topological couplings and draw general lessons for the classification of cobordism defects of bulk quantum gravity theories in the swampland program.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic safe nonassociative quantum gravity with star R-flux products, Goroff-Sagnotti counter-terms, and geometric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonassociative modifications of general relativity, GR, defined by star products with R-flux deformations in string gravity consist of an important subclass of modified gravity theories, MGTs. A longstanding criticism for elaborating quantum gravity, QG, argue that the asymptotic safety does not survive once certain perturbative terms (in general, nonassociative and noncommutative) are included in the projection space. The goal of this work is to prove that a generalized asymptotic safety scenario allows us to formulate physically viable nonassociative QG theories using effective models defined by generic off-diagonal solutions and nonlinear symmetries in nonassociative geometric flow and gravity theories. We elaborate on a new nonholonomic functional renormalization techniques with parametric renormalization group, RG, flow equations for effective actions supplemented by certain canonical two-loop counter-terms. The geometric constructions and quantum deformations are performed for nonassociative phase spaces modelled as R-flux deformed cotangent Lorentz bundles. Our results prove that theories involving nonassociative modifications of GR can be well defined both as classical nonassociative MGTs and QG models. Such theories are characterized by generalized G. Perelman thermodynamic variables which are computed for certain examples of nonassociative geometric and RG flows.</description>

      <title>Modular symmetry of localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the modular symmetry of localized modes on fixed points of $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. First, we find that the localized modes with even (odd) modular weight generally have $\Delta(6n^2)$ ($\Delta'(6n^2)$) modular flavor symmetry. Moreover, when we consider an additional Ansatz, the localized modes with even (odd) modular weight generally enjoy $S_3$ ($S'_4$) modular flavor symmetry, and we show the concrete wave functions of the localized modes.</description>

      <title>Tracing cosmic stretch marks: probing scale invariance in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a scale-invariant inflationary model characterized by a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity and a curvature term quadratic in the Ricci scalar. The model's dynamic is analyzed using a full numerical solution of the two-field system, going beyond previous analytical studies. We derive robust constraints on the model parameters using the latest Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and BICEP/Keck. The study confirms that scale-invariance effectively reduces the system to single-field dynamics, eliminating entropy perturbations and ensuring stability. Key predictions include a minimal level of primordial gravitational waves with a tensor-to-scalar ratio r &gt; 0.003, which upcoming CMB experiments are well-positioned to test. The model is compared to Starobinsky and $\alpha$ - attractor inflation, with future observations of tensor modes offering a potential discriminator between them. Overall, the results suggest that scale-invariant inflation is a viable and competitive framework for explaining early universe dynamics and predicting cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Modular Properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the modular properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) in two dimensional conformal field theories. These are obtained by inserting higher spin charges in the expressions for the partition function of the theory. We investigate the particular case where KdV charges are inserted in the GGE. We first determine an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE. This expression is an expansion in terms of the zero modes of all the quasi-primary fields in the theory, not just the KdV charges. While these charges are non-commuting they can be re-exponentiated to give an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE in terms of another GGE. As an explicit example we focus on the Lee-Yang model. We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz in the Lee-Yang model to first replicate the asymptotic results, and then find additional energies that need to be included in the transformed GGE in order to find the exact modular transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the entanglement structure in a $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed holographic CFT$_2$ with a conserved angular momentum. We utilize conformal perturbation theory to compute the leading order correction to the entanglement entropy and the reflected entropy due to the $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$ deformation in the limit of large central charge. In the dual bulk perspective described by a rotating BTZ black hole with a finite radial cut-off, we compute the holographic entanglement entropy and the entanglement wedge cross-section and observe perfect agreement with our field theoretic computation for small values of the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram from Nonlinear Interaction between Superconducting Order and Density: Toward Data-Based Holographic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euler Equation from Effective Action: Implications for the Smarr Formula in AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derived a generalized Euler equation, $\epsilon+p=sT+\mu q+y\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}$, using the effective field theory formulation of perfect fluids. This generalization was achieved by introducing a new variable $y$ into the effective action, which encodes geometrical information about the spacetime where the fluid is on. Notably, the generalized Euler equation is independent of the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, when applied to a holographic perfect fluid, this equation naturally recovers the Smarr formula for AdS black holes, thus situating the physical interpretation of the Smarr formula within the framework of Gauge/Gravity duality. Finally, our findings raise questions regarding the validity of the extended black hole thermodynamics proposal, which associates the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ with a thermodynamic variable.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory, Gravity and Second order Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that a consistent coupling of a quantum theory to gravity requires an extension of ordinary `first order' Riemannian geometry to second order Riemannian geometry, which incorporates both a line element and an area element. This extension results in a misalignment between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the tangent spaces. In particular, we find that for a 4-dimensional spacetime, tangent spaces become 18-dimensional. We then discuss the construction of physical theories within this framework, which involves the introduction of terms that are quadratic in derivatives in the action. On a flat spacetime, the quadratic sector is perpendicular to the first order sector and only affects the normalization of the path integral, whereas in a curved spacetime the quadratic sector couples to the first order sector. Moreover, we show that, despite the introduction of higher order derivatives, the Ostragradski instability can be avoided, due to an order mixing of the two sectors. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher order geometry and on relations with non-commutative and generalized geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tensor model generalization of the quantum $p$-spherical model in the large-$N$ limit. While the tensor model has the same large-$N$ expansion as the disordered quantum $p$-spherical model, its ground state is superextensive, in contradiction with large-$N$ perturbation theory. Therefore, the large-$N$ expansion of this model catastrophically fails at arbitrarily large-$N$, without any obvious signal in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Weyl calculus for gauge theory and non-dissipative transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a theory of fermions interacting with a (in general, non-Abelian) gauge field. The theory is assumed to be essentially inhomogeneous, which might be provided by non-trivial background fields interacting with both fermions and gauge bosons. For this theory, a version of Wigner-Weyl calculus is constructed, in which the Wigner transformation of the fermion Green function belongs to the adjoint representation of the gauge group. We demonstrate the power of the proposed formalism through the representation of responses of vector and axial currents to the gauge field strength through the topological invariants composed of the Wigner transformed two-point Green functions. This way a new family of non-dissipative transport phenomena is introduced. In particular, we discuss the non-Abelian versions of the chiral separation effect and of the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Classical Weight-Four L-value Ratios as Sums of Calabi--Yau Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the series solutions of the attractor equations of 4d N=2 supergravities obtained by Calabi--Yau compactifications previously studied in Candelas, Kuusela, and McGovern (2021). While only convergent for a restricted set of black hole charges, we find that they are summable with Pad\'e resummation providing a suitable method. By specialising these solutions to rank-two attractors, we obtain many conjectural identities of the type discovered in CKM. These equate ratios of weight-four special L-values with an infinite series whose summands are formed out of genus-0 Gromov--Witten invariants. We also present two new rank-two attractors which belong to moduli spaces each interesting in their own right. Each moduli space possesses two points of maximal unipotent monodromy. One has already been studied by Hosono and Takagi, and we discuss issues stemming from the associated L-function having nonzero rank.</description>

Abstract: The sound modes of a flowing superfluid is described by the massless Klein-Gordon equation in an effective background metric. This effective background metric can be designed to mimick a black hole using the acoustic horizon. In this work, we study the AdS/CFT dual of the sound modes in the presence of an acoustic horizon in the bulk. Focusing on fluids with a purely radial flow, we derive the metric tensor for the effective acoustic spacetime and deduce a necessary condition for an acoustic black hole geometry to exist within the fluid. Using specific examples of superfluid velocity profiles, we obtained the source, operator expectation value, Green's function, and spectral density of the dual field theory by solving for the asymptotic behavior of the sound modes near the AdS boundary. In all our examples, the sound modes remain gapless but the excitations are described by branch cuts, instead of poles, which is typical of strongly coupled systems. Furthermore, we calculate the effective Hawking temperature of the dual field theory associated with the bulk acoustic horizon. Lastly, we investigate the near horizon properties and derive the superfluid velocity profile that can give rise to an infrared emergent quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to baryogenesis in $f(Q,L_{m})$ gravity and its cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an examination of the $f(Q,L_{m})$ gravity model, in which the functional form $f(Q,L_{m})=\alpha Q^{n}+\beta L_{m}$ is postulated and discuss its potential impact on cosmological dynamics and the phenomenon of gravitational baryogenesis. Combining observational insights from Hubble, BAO and phantom datasets, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to constrain the model's parameters and determine the baryon-to-entropy ratio $\frac{\eta_{B}}{s}$, providing valuable insights into the model's performance and cosmological implications. In the context of baryogenesis and generalized gravitational baryogenesis, we show that setting $n=\frac{1}{2}$ results in a zero baryon-to-entropy ratio, which is physically implausible. Through a detailed examination of the dependence of $\frac{\eta_{B}}{s}$ on $n$ and $\beta$, we demonstrate that our model predicts a baryon-to-entropy ratio that is both positive and consistent with the observational upper limit of $9.42\times10^{-11}$ for $1.32965&lt;n&lt;1.39252$ and appropriate of $\beta$ and $n$ with $\alpha\simeq-1.95084\times10^{86}$. The excellent agreement between our model's predictions and the phantom dataset demonstrates the model's capacity to accurately describe the physics of baryogenesis and its ability to reproduce the observed features of the cosmological data, showcasing its potential as a reliable tool for understanding the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Influence of GUP corrected Casimir energy on zero tidal force wormholes in modified teleparallel gravity with matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, the study of the Casimir effect in quantum field theory has garnered increasing attention because of its potential to be an ideal source of exotic matter needed for stabilizing traversable wormholes. It has been confirmed through experimental evidence that this phenomenon involves fluctuations in the vacuum field, leading to a negative energy density. Motivated by the above, we have investigated Casimir wormholes with corrections from the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of matter-coupled teleparallel gravity. Our analysis includes three well-known GUP models: the Kempf, Mangano, and Mann (KMM) model, the Detournay, Gabriel, and Spindel (DGS) model, and a third model called Model II. For a broader analysis, we have considered two well-known model functions for the teleparallel theory: a linear $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha T+\beta\mathcal{T}$ and a quadratic model $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\eta T^2+\chi\mathcal{T}$. The shape function solutions corresponding to both models are examined in the absence of tidal forces in spacetime. We also demonstrate the crucial role played by the parameters of the $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ models in the violation of the energy conditions. With the increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical objects, we have thoroughly discussed the perturbation of the wormhole solutions in the scalar, electromagnetic, axial gravitational, and Dirac field backgrounds. We employ the $3^{rd}$ order WKB expansion to find the complex frequencies associated with the quasinormal modes of energy dissipation. Additionally, we also calculate the active mass and total gravitational energy for the wormhole geometry. The amount of exotic matter involved in sustaining these wormholes is also found in this paper. Furthermore, the physical stability of such Casimir wormholes is examined using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: Efficient Evaluation of the Spectral EMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Energy Mover's Distance (EMD) has seen use in collider physics as a metric between events and as a geometric method of defining infrared and collinear safe observables. Recently, the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) has been proposed as a more analytically tractable alternative to the EMD. In this work, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Riemannian-like p = 2 SEMD metric between events, eliminating the need to numerically solve an optimal transport problem. Additionally, we show how the SEMD can be used to define event and jet shape observables by minimizing the distance between events and parameterized energy flows (similar to the EMD), and we obtain closed-form expressions for several of these observables. We also present the SPECTER framework, an efficient and highly parallelized implementation of the SEMD metric and SEMD-derived shape observables as an analogue of the previously-introduced SHAPER for EMD-based computations. We demonstrate that computing the SEMD with SPECTER can be up to a thousand times faster than computing the EMD with standard optimal transport libraries.</description>

      <title>Direct current memory effects in effective-one-body waveform models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct current (DC) memory is a non-oscillatory, hereditary component of the gravitational wave (GW) signal that represents one of the most peculiar manifestations of the nonlinear nature of GW emission and propagation. In this work, by transforming the results provided in Ebersold et al. [Phys.Rev.D 100 (2019) 8, 084043] in harmonic coordinates and quasi-Keplerian parametrization, we provide the DC memory in terms of the effective-one-body (EOB) phase-space variables, with a relative accuracy of 2.5PN and in an expansion for small eccentricity up to order six. Our results are then implemented in TEOBResumS-Dal\'i, thus providing the first EOB model with DC memory contributions. This model is then used to assess the impact on the waveform and the main features of the DC memory, also addressing its dependence on the eccentricity of the binary system at its formation.</description>

      <title>Error-Correcting Codes in TQFT on Multispheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFT) encode quantum correlations in topological features of spaces. In this work, we leverage this feature to explore how information encoded in TQFTs can be stored and retrieved in the presence of local decoherence affecting its physical carriers. TQFT states' inherent nonlocality, redundancy, and entanglement position them as natural error-correcting codes. We demonstrate that information recovery protocols can be derived from the principle that protected information must be uniformly distributed across the system and from interpreting correlations in terms of space connectivity. Specifically, we employ a topological framework to devise erasure error correction protocols, showing that information can be successfully recovered even when parts of the system are corrupted.</description>

      <title>Charged gravastar model in noncommutative geometry under $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of charged gravastars in torsion-based $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity in the presence of noncommutative geometry. We have taken the interior from noncommutative motivated space-time, noting that why, from a physical point of view, such a choice is justified, then we have taken the thin shell as stiff matter and taken three different exterior metrics (Reissner-Nordstrom (R-N), Bardeen and Ayon-Beato-Garcia (ABG) metric) to construct the gravastar model. We have studied the physical properties like proper length, entropy, energy, and EoS for these models, and we have also used Israel junction conditions to study the effective pressure, energy density, and potential of the thin shell. Finally, we comment on the stability of such a thin shell and the deflection angle caused by such a thin shell, which could, in principle, be tested by future radio telescopes like the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we explore the $f(Q,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu})$ gravity theory, building upon the foundations laid by the $f(Q)$ and $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories. Here, $Q$ represents non-metricity and $T_{\mu\nu}$ stands for the energy-momentum tensor. The proposed action encompasses an arbitrary function of both non-metricity $Q$ and the square of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically $T^2=T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu}$. We find the analytical solution for the barotropic fluid case $p=\omega \rho$ for the model $f(Q, T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) = Q + \eta(T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) $. We constrain parameters of the solution $H(z)$ utilizing CC, BAO, and latest Pantheon+SH0ES samples with the help of Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling technique along with Bayesian statistical analysis. Further, from the Om diagnostic test, we find that the assumed cosmological model favors the quintessence regime.</description>

Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, further crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behaviors at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality: effective (Abelian or nonAbelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge if gauge modes develop critical correlations, while more standard critical behaviors occur in the case they remain short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlators from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and nonAbelian gauge fields. We mainly focus on three-dimensional systems, and briefly discuss two-dimensional systems, whose equilibrium statistical properties are described by a classical partition function. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic Gravity supplements the Einstein-Hilbert action by terms quadratic in the spacetime curvature. This leads to a rich phase space of static, compact gravitating objects including the Schwarzschild black hole, wormholes, and naked singularities. For the first time, we study the collapse of a spherically symmetric star with uniform dust density in this setting. The symmetries of the problem make the interior solution insensitive to the Weyl-squared term, so that the interior dynamics is fully determined by $R$ and $R^2$. As our main result, we find that the collapse leads to the formation of a horizon, implying that the endpoint of a uniform dust collapse in Quadratic Gravity is not a horizonless spacetime. We also show that the curvature-squared contribution is responsible for making the collapse into a singularity faster than the standard Oppenheimer-Snyder scenario. Furthermore, the junction conditions connecting spacetime inside and outside the matter distribution are found to be significantly more constraining than their counterparts in General Relativity and we discuss key properties of any exterior solution matching to the spacetime inside the collapsing star.</description>

      <title>A way of decoupling the gravitational bulk field equations of braneworld black holes to suppress the bulk singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a methodology for decoupling the bulk gravitational field equations of braneworld black holes to suppress the bulk singularities. To achieve this, we apply a linear Minimal Geometric Deformation (MGD) with respect to a coupling constant \( \alpha \) to the $4D$ Minkowski spacetime embedded in an extra dimension. This results in a gravitational decoupling into a system \( \mathcal{A} \) with equations of motion of order \( \alpha^0 \) and a system \( \mathcal{B} \), related to the so-called Quasi-Einstein equations of order \( \alpha \). This methodology allows for the construction of a regular geometry everywhere. We outline the necessary constraints for eliminating singularities and provide a recipe for solving the equations of motion. Both the warp factor, the scalar field, and the potential obtained are smooth and free from Dirac delta singularities. A control parameter is introduced such that, in the limit \( b \to 0 \), the Randall-Sundrum (RS) setup is recovered, resulting in a transition from a thick brane to a thin brane. The asymptotic behavior of the curvature invariant \( \displaystyle \lim_{y \to \pm \infty} R_{5D}(r,y) \) is positive near the de Sitter core (for small \( r \)), asymptotically negative for finite \( r &gt; r_* \), and asymptotically flat at the $4D$ boundary as \( r \to \infty \). Although this work aims to suppress bulk singularities, it is expected that our methodology may be useful for future investigations related to the embedding of gravitational objects within other braneworld contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate perturbations in power-law monomial potentials within inflationary models driven by a single scalar field. By introducing a second term to the original potential, we study how this perturbation influences the slow-roll parameters and analyze the consequent changes in the spectral index, $n_s$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, treating the additional term as a correction to the monomial case. Comparing our numerical results with current cosmological data from the Planck satellite observations on $n_s$, $r$, and the clustering parameter, $\sigma_8$, we place significant constraints on the free parameter of our class of inflationary potentials. We found that the perturbative consistency method we analyze could be an interesting test to explore for more complex inflationary models, looking for features that better match the data that might highlight fundamental physics implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recent formalism developed for computing rapidity anomalous dimension of form factors using unitarity to the problem of high-energy near forward scattering. By combining the factorization of $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering in the effective field theory (EFT) for Glauber operators with definite signature amplitudes, we derive an expression that relates anomalous dimensions (including Regge trajectories) to cut amplitudes, leading to significant computational simplifications. We demonstrate this explicitly by computing the one and two-loop Regge trajectories. Our formalism can also be used to bootstrap anomalous dimensions of operators not related by symmetries. As an example, we show that the full anomalous dimensions (including both the Regge pole and cut pieces) of the two Glauber operator anti-symmetric octet operator, can be determined from the anomalous dimension of the single Glauber exchange operator. Many other such relations exist between other color channels at each order in $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Self interacting scalar field theory in general curved spacetimes at zero and finite temperature revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), its restoration and phase transition for a self interacting quantum scalar field in a general curved background, at zero and finite temperature. To the best of our knowledge, most of the earlier computations in this context have been done in the linear order in curvature, which may not be very suitable for the Ricci flat spacetimes. One of our objectives is to see whether the higher order terms can bring in qualitatively new physical effects, and thereby attempting to fill in this gap in the literature. We use the Bunch-Parker local momentum space representation of the Feynman propagator. We compute the renormalised, background spacetime curvature (up to quadratic order) and temperature dependent one loop effective potential for $\phi^4$ plus $\phi^3$ self interaction. In particular for the de Sitter spacetime, we have shown for $\phi^4$-theory that we can have SSB for a scalar even with a positive rest mass squared and non-minimal coupling, at zero temperature. This cannot be achieved by the linear curvature term alone and the result remains valid for a very large range of renormalisation scale. For a phase transition, we have computed the leading curvature correction to the critical temperature. At finite temperature, symmetry restoration is also demonstrated. We also extend some of the above results to two loop level. The symmetry breaking in de Sitter at two loop remains present. We have further motivated the necessity of treating this problem non-perturbatively in some instances.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Meets Quantum Chaos: Anomalous Relaxation and Mpemba Crossings in Dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MPE), named after a student who discovered the phenomenon during a classroom experiment, has intrigued scientists for decades. This effect challenges conventional wisdom by demonstrating that the hot milk can freeze faster than cold milk under certain conditions. Recently, similar effects have been found in integrable quantum systems. However, the key distinction between the classical MPE and its quantum analog is that the latter relies predominantly on the of the properties of the initial states rather than the cooling rate. In this paper, we explore the quench dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) systems coupled to thermal baths. We investigate three scenarios--an SYK system coupled with an SYK thermal bath, an SYK system coupled with two thermal baths at different temperatures, and a dissipative SYK system modeled by the Lindblad equation. In the regimes where the system and the baths are strongly coupled, we observe effective temperature oscillations and Mpemba crossings (MPCs)--an effect of temperature crossings which are absent in the equilibrium thermodynamic analysis--when the system is strongly coupled to SYK thermal baths. The emergence of the MPCs suggests the observation of a transient MPE in the cooling or heating process before the systems reach the steady states. The emergence of MPCs in quantum chaotic systems exhibits strong parallels with the classical MPE.</description>

      <title>Subtleties in the calculation of correlation functions for hot and dense systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss subtleties in the calculation of loop integrals in studies of hot and dense systems as they appear in both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches. To be specific, we address subtleties which appear in situations where the order of integration, differentiation, and limit processes plays a crucial role. For example, this applies to computations of the effective action and the computation of momentum-dependent correlation functions. In particular, the zero-temperature limit is delicate in systems with fermions because of the presence of discontinuities at the Fermi surface. We provide a general discussion of scenarios where the computation and evaluation of loop integrals in the context of relativistic theories requires particular attention as a change of the order of the involved mathematical operations may lead to a different result. Our general considerations are then illustrated with the aid of concrete examples, namely by the computation of screening masses from fully momentum-dependent correlation functions in the context of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive ``gluon'' of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and echoes of a double braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational quasinormal modes and the gravitational echoes of a double braneworld. The double braneworld is a kind of split thick brane, which is crucial for addressing the hierarchy problem in the thick brane scenarios. Using the Bernstein spectral method, direct integration method, and asymptotic iteration method, we calculate the quasinormal mode frequencies of the double brane. We find that the quasinormal spectrum is very different from that of the single brane model, especially the high overtone mode. We also perform numerical evolution to study the time-domain properties of the characteristic modes of the double brane. The results show that when the degree of brane splitting is large, gravitational echoes of oscillation attenuation between sub-branes will appear in the thick brane. Furthermore, different long-lived Kaluza-Klein modes interfere with each other, resulting in a beating effect. Compared to a single brane model, the phenomenon of the split double brane is richer, and the lifetime of the massive Kaluza-Klein graviton of the double brane is longer. These phenomena may have potential phenomenological interest. We hope to detect these extra-dimensional signals in future gravitational wave detectors or accelerators.</description>

      <title>Higgs-muon interactions at a multi-TeV muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a simple yet general parameterization of Higgs-muon interactions within the effective field theory frameworks, including both the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We investigate the potential of a muon collider, operating at center-of-mass energies of 3 and 10 TeV, to probe Higgs-muon interactions. All possible processes involving the direct production of multiple electroweak bosons ($W$, $Z$, and $H$) with up to five final-state particles are considered. Our findings indicate that a muon collider can achieve greater sensitivity than the high-luminosity LHC, especially considering the independence of the Higgs decay branching fraction to muons. Notably, a 10 TeV muon collider offers exceptional sensitivity to muon-Higgs interactions, surpassing the 3 TeV option. In particular, searches based on multi-Higgs production prove highly effective for probing these couplings.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the problem of canonical quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown that a consistent procedure of canonical quantization of the field can be carried out without taking into account the internal region of the black hole. We prove that there exists a unitary gauge, which can be viewed as a combination of the Coulomb and Poincare gauges and is compatible with the field equations. The solutions corresponding to the stationary one-particle states of the electromagnetic field are studied, the canonical commutation relations and the Hamiltonian of the quantized electromagnetic field are obtained.</description>

      <title>Unitarity and strong graded locality of holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras with central charge at most 24</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that all nice holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras (VOSAs) with central charge at most 24 and with non-trivial odd part are unitary, apart from the hypothetical ones arising as fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA or of the latter tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA. Furthermore, excluding the ones with central charge 24 of glueing type III and with no real free fermion, we show that they are all strongly graded-local. In particular, they naturally give rise to holomorphic graded-local conformal nets. In total, we are able to prove that 910 of the 969 nice holomorphic VOSAs with central charge 24 and with non-trivial odd part are strongly graded-local, without counting hypothetical fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA.</description>

Abstract: We used the Cartan formalism to construct fermionic models that are compatible with Galilean or Carrollian symmetry and rigid scaling symmetry. The free Carrollian fermion model exhibits conformal Carrollian symmetry which is isomorphic to the asymptotic symmetries for flat spacetime in three dimensions, namely the BMS$_3$ symmetry. We performed canonical quantization to this free BMS fermion model, discussed both the highest weight vacuum and the induced vacuum, calculated the correlation functions and the torus partition function. Finally we constructed $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric theories by combining the free fermion model and the free scalar model.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study compactifications of 6d $(1,0)$ SCFTs, in particular those of conformal matter type, on K\"ahler 4-manifolds. We show how this can be realized via wrapping M5 branes on 4-cycles of non-compact Calabi-Yau fourfolds with ADE singularity in the fiber. Such compactifications lead to domain walls in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories which flow to 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ SCFTs. We compute the central charges of such 2d CFTs via 6d anomaly polynomials by employing a particular topological twist along the 4-manifold. Moreover, we study compactifications on non-compact 4-manifolds leading to coupled 3d-2d systems. We show how these can be glued together consistently to reproduce the central charge and anomaly polynomial obtained in the compact case. Lastly, we study concrete CFT proposals for some special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently suggested that quantum theory may support a unification of the notions of space and time, as such, treating the spatial and temporal correlations equally. To be more precise, the partial transposition of the maximally entangled state of two quantum systems at one time exactly matches the temporal correlations of one quantum system that unitary evolved between two distinct moments of time. In this essay we consider this equivalence of spatial and temporal correlations in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. We argue that in the high temperature limit the thermofield double state is the equivalent of temporal correlation of a quantum theory unitary evolving at two times. Thus, on the gravity side, we imagine that the temporal correlations correspond to a black hole at one time connected behind the horizon to the same black hole at another time by an Einstein-Rosen bridge. We show that the correspondent spacetime of this temporal wormhole is the interior solution of AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. Implications of this correspondence are briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Universal rapidity scaling of entanglement entropy inside hadrons from conformal invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a hadron is probed at high energy, a nontrivial quantum entanglement entropy inside the hadron emerges due to the lack of complete information about the hadron wave function extracted from this measurement. In the high-energy limit, the hadron becomes a maximally entangled state, with a linear dependence of entanglement entropy on rapidity, as has been found in a recent analysis based on parton description. In this paper, we use an effective conformal field theoretic description of hadrons on the light cone to show that the linear dependence of the entanglement entropy on rapidity found in parton description is a general consequence of approximate conformal invariance and does not depend on the assumption of weak coupling. Our result also provides further evidence for a duality between the parton and string descriptions of hadrons.</description>

Abstract: We derive the quantum effective action and the respective quantum equations of motion from multi-graviton correlation functions in asymptotically safe quantum gravity. The fully momentum-dependent couplings of three- and four-graviton scatterings are computed within the functional renormalisation group approach and the effective action is reconstructed from these vertices. The resulting quantum equations of motion are solved numerically for quantum black hole geometries. Importantly, the black hole solutions show signatures of quantum gravity outside the classical horizon, which manifest in the behaviour of the temporal and radial components of the metric. Three different types of solutions with distinct causal structures are identified and the phase structure of the solution space is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05769v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present an algebraic and kinematical analysis of non-commutative $\kappa$-Minkowski spaces within Galilean (non-relativistic) and Carrollian (ultra-relativistic) regimes. Utilizing the theory of Wigner-In\"{o}nu contractions, we begin with a brief review of how one can apply these contractions to the well-known Poincar\'e algebra, yielding the corresponding Galilean (both massive and mass-less) and Carrollian algebras as $c \to \infty$ and $c\to 0$, respectively. Subsequently, we methodically apply these contractions to non-commutative $\kappa$-deformed spaces, revealing compelling insights into the interplay among the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$ (with $|a^\nu|$ being of the order of Planck length scale) and the speed of light $c$ as it approaches both infinity and zero. Our exploration predicts a sort of "branching" of the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$, leading to the emergence of a novel length scale and time scale in either limit. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the examination of curved momentum spaces and their geodesic distances in appropriate subspaces of the $\kappa$-deformed Newtonian and Carrollian space-times. We finally delve into the study of their deformed dispersion relations, arising from these deformed geodesic distances, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nature of these space-times.</description>

      <title>Relativity of the event: examples in JT gravity and linearized GR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observables in quantum gravity are famously defined asymptotically, at the boundary of AdS or Minkowski spaces. However, by gauge fixing a coordinate system or suitably dressing the field operators, an approximate, "quasi-local" approach is also possible, that can give account of the measurements performed by a set of observers living inside the spacetime. In particular, one can attach spatial coordinates to the worldlines of these observers and use their proper times as a time coordinate. Here we highlight that any such local formulation has to face the relativity of the event, in that changing frame (= set of observers) implies a reshuffling of the point-events and the way they are identified. As a consequence, coordinate transformations between different frames become probabilistic in quantum gravity. We give a concrete realization of this mechanism in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, where a point in the bulk can be defined operationally with geodesics anchored to the boundary. We describe different ways to do so, each corresponding to a different frame, and compute the variances of the transformations relating some of these frames. In particular, we compute the variance of the location of the black hole horizon, which appears smeared in most frames. We then suggest how to calculate this effect in Einstein gravity, assuming knowledge of the wavefunction of the metric. The idea is to expand the latter on a basis of semiclassical states. Each element of this basis enjoys standard/deterministic coordinate transformations and the result is thus obtained by superposition. As a divertissement, we sabotage the familiar Lorentz boosts by adding to Minkoswki spacetime a quantum superposition of gravitational waves and compute the probabilistic transformation to a boosted frame in linearized gravity. Finally, we attempt to translate the relativity of the event in the language of dressed operators.</description>

      <title>Firewalls at exponentially late times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a version of the typical state firewall setup recently reintroduced by Stanford and Yang, who found that wormholes may create firewalls. We examine a late-time double scaling limit in JT gravity in which one can resum the expansion in the number of wormholes, and we use this to study the exact distribution of interior slices at times exponential in the entropy. We consider a thermofield double with and without early perturbations on a boundary. These perturbations can appear on interior slices as dangerous high energy shocks. For exponentially late times, wormholes tend to teleport the particles created by perturbations and render the interior more dangerous. In states with many perturbations separated by large times, the probability of a safe interior is exponentially small. Such states thus almost certainly have firewalls at the horizon, even though they would be safe without wormholes. With perturbation, even in the safest state we conceive, the odds of encountering a firewall are fifty-fifty. One interpretation of the phenomena found here is that wormholes can change time-ordered contours into effective out-of-time-ordered folds, making shockwaves appear in unexpected places.</description>

      <title>Bulk Viscosity, Speed of Sound and Contact Structure at Intermediate Coupling</title>

Abstract: In the context of strongly coupled thermal QCD-like theories, the bulk viscosity($\zeta$)-to-shear viscosity($\eta$) ratio using the type IIA-theory dual of thermal QCD-like theories was shown to vary like $\frac{1}{3} - c_s^2$ (arXiv:1807.04713) ($c_s$ being the speed of sound), and the same ($\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$) at weak coupling using kinetic theory and finite temperature field theory, was shown and is known to vary like $\left(\frac{1}{3} - c_s^2\right)^2$ (arXiv:1807.04713). The novelties of the results of this paper are that we not only show for the first time from ${\cal M}$ theory that at intermediate coupling, with the inclusion of the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections, the result obtained for $\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$ interpolates between the strong and weak coupling results in a way consistent with lattice computations of $SU(3)$ Gluodynamics (arXiv:0710.3717 [hep-lat]) within statistical errors (and within the temperature range permissible by our ${\cal M}$-theory uplift), but also observe that this behavior is related to the existence of Contact 3-Structures that exist only at intermediate coupling effected by the intermediate-$N$ "MQGP" limit of (arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th]). We also obtain an explicit dependence of $\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$ on (fractional powers of) the temperature-dependent/running gauge coupling (and its temperature derivative), and verify that the weak-coupling result dominates at large temperatures. We further conjecture that the aforementioned fractional-power-dependence of $\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$ on the gauge coupling is related to the lack of ``$N$-connectedness'' in the parameter space of Contact 3-Structures (as shown in arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th]).</description>

Abstract: Previous work has given proof and evidence that BPS states in local Calabi-Yau 3-folds can be described and counted by exponential networks on the punctured plane, with the help of a suitable non-abelianization map to the mirror curve. This provides an appealing elementary depiction of moduli of special Lagrangian submanifolds, but so far only a handful of examples have been successfully worked out in detail. In this note, we exhibit an explicit correspondence between torus fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb C^2\subset\mathbb C^3$ and anomaly free exponential networks attached to the quadratically framed pair of pants. This description realizes an interesting, and seemingly novel, "age decomposition" of linear partitions. We also provide further details about the networks' perspective on the full D-brane moduli space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the application of the q-algebra in the glueballs spectrum. This algebra is implemented through Jackson derivatives in a Schr\"odinger-like equation resulting from the gravity fluctuations around the braneworld scenario in five dimensions. In our prescription, we consider a four-dimensional AdS$4$ brane, living in AdS$5$ bulk, that is also known for describing locally localized gravity via quasi-zero mode. At the appropriate limit, this background leads to confinement and allows us to find the shape of the $q$-deformed glueball spectrum in the AdS$5$/QCD$4$ correspondence. The introduction of the $q$-deformation provides us with a richer glueball spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider type IIB string theory with $N$ D3 branes and various configurations of sevenbranes, such that the string coupling $g_s$ is fixed to a constant finite value. These are the simplest realizations of F-theory, and are holographically dual to rank $N$ Argyres-Douglas conformal field theories (CFTs) with $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ flavor groups, and Minahan-Nemeschansky CFTs with $E_6, E_7$ and $E_8$ flavor groups. We use the Seiberg-Witten curves of these theories to compute the mass deformed sphere free energy $F(m)$ at large $N$ in terms of novel matrix models with non-polynomial potentials. We show how $F(m)$ can be used along with the analytic bootstrap to fix the large $N$ expansion of flavor multiplet correlators in these CFTs, which are dual to scattering of gluons on $AdS_5\times S^3$, and in the flat space limit determine the effective theory of sevenbranes in F-theory. As a first step in this program, we use the matrix models to compute the $\log N$ term in $F(m)$ and thereby fix the logarithmic threshold in the $AdS_5\times S^3$ holographic correlator, which matches the flat space prediction.</description>

Abstract: We present the proof of renormalization of the Horava theory, in the nonprojectable version. We obtain a form of the quantum action that exhibits a manifest BRST-symmetry structure. Previous analysis has shown that the divergences produced by irregular loops cancel completely between them. The remaining divergences are local. The renormalization is achieved by using the approach developed by Barvinsky et al. with the background-field formalism.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Black Bounce to Transversable Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a way for embedding a 4-dimensional geometry corresponding to the Simpson Visser (SV) spacetime which is capable of representing a traversable wormhole, a one-way wormhole, or a regular black hole into a Randall-Sundrum setup. To achieve this, we linearly deform the bulk geometry and the bulk matter distribution concerning a coupling constant. These deformations induce a transition from a $5D$ vacuum AdS state to an anisotropic matter distribution. The latter results in the induced geometry on the brane transitioning from a singular Schwarzschild spacetime to a regularized SV spacetime. Since there are no sources or matter fields on the brane, we can assert that the induced SV geometry on the brane arises from the influence of geometrical and matter deformations in the bulk. Thus, the central singularity is suppressed. We determine the cases where the energy conditions are either satisfied or violated. Our spacetime is asymptotically radial AdS, which is intriguing given the absence of a global AdS box that would prevent instability under larger wavelength perturbations. Therefore, it is no longer appropriate to claim that instability exists for very small perturbations near the AdS horizon. Thus, we propose that the stability of the solution can be analyzed by examining the speed of sound due to the presence of matter fields in the energy momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

Abstract: We propose a series representation for the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge. Two distinct, yet closely related formulas are needed for the cases $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ and $c &lt;1$. Our proposal for $c &lt;1$ agrees numerically with the fusion transformation of the four-point spherical conformal blocks, whereas our proposal for $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ agrees numerically with Ponsot and Teschner's integral formula for the fusion kernel. The case of the modular kernel is studied as a special case of the fusion kernel.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a definition of time that emerges in terms of the geometry of the configuration space of a dynamical system. We illustrate this, using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, in various examples: particle mechanics on a fixed energy surface; non-Abelian gauge theories for compact semi-simple Lie groups where the Gauss law presents new features; and General Relativity in $d+1$ dimensions with $d$ the dimension of space. The discussion in General Relativity is like the non-abelian gauge theory case except for the indefiniteness of the de Witt metric in the Einstein-Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which we discuss in some detail. We illustrate the general formula for the emergent time in various examples including de Sitter spacetime and asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04234v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hidden amplitude zeros discovered by Arkani-Hamed et al., which describe a non-trivial vanishing of scattering amplitudes on special external kinematics. We first prove that every type of hidden zero is equivalent to what we call a "subset" enhanced scaling under Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten shifts, for any rational function built from planar Lorentz invariants $X_{ij}{=}(p_i{+}p_{i+1}{+}\ldots{+}p_{j-1})^2$. This directly applies to Tr($\phi^3$), non-linear sigma model, or Yang-Mills-scalar amplitudes, revealing a novel type of enhanced UV scaling in these theories. We also use this observation to prove the conjecture that Tr($\phi^3$) amplitudes are uniquely fixed by the zeros, up to an overall normalization, when assuming an ordered and local propagator structure and trivial numerators. In the case of Yang-Mills theory, we conjecture the zeros, combined with the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson color-kinematic duality in the form of amplitude relations, uniquely fix the $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ distinct polarization structures of $n$-point gluon amplitudes. Our approach opens a new avenue for understanding previous similar uniqueness results, and also extending them beyond tree level for the first time.</description>

      <title>Global aspects of $3$-form gauge theory: implications for axion-Yang-Mills systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the proposition that axion-Yang-Mills systems are characterized by a $3$-form gauge theory in the deep infrared regime. This hypothesis is rigorously examined by initially developing a systematic framework for analyzing $3$-form gauge theory coupled to an axion, specifically focusing on its global properties. The theory consists of a BF term deformed by marginal and irrelevant operators and describes a network of vacua separated by domain walls converging at the junction of an axion string. It encompasses $0$- and $3$-form spontaneously broken global symmetries. Utilizing this framework, in conjunction with effective field theory techniques and 't Hooft anomaly-matching conditions, we argue that the $3$-form gauge theory faithfully captures the infrared physics of the axion-Yang-Mills system. The ultraviolet theory is an $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory endowed with a massless Dirac fermion coupled to a complex scalar and is characterized by chiral and genuine $\mathbb{Z}_m^{(1)}$ $1$-form center symmetries, with a mixed anomaly between them. It features two scales: the vev of the complex scalar, $v$, and the strong-coupling scale, $\Lambda$, with $\Lambda \ll v$. Below $v$, the fermion decouples and a $U(1)^{(2)}$ $2$-form winding symmetry emerge, while the $1$-form symmetry is enhanced to $\mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$. As we flow below $\Lambda$, matching the mixed anomaly necessitates introducing a dynamical $3$-form gauge field of $U(1)^{(2)}$, which appears as the incarnation of a long-range tail of the color field. The infrared theory possesses spontaneously broken chiral and emergent $3$-form global symmetries. It passes several checks, among which: it displays the expected restructuring in the hadronic sector upon transition between the vacua, and it is consistent under the gauging of the genuine $\mathbb Z_m^{(1)}\subset \mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the baby universe operator $\mathcal{B}_a$ in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model, which creates a baby universe of size $a$. We find that $\mathcal{B}_a$ is written in terms of the transfer matrix $T$, and vice versa. In particular, the identity operator on the chord Hilbert space is expanded as a linear combination of $\mathcal{B}_a$, which implies that the disk partition function of DSSYK is written as a linear combination of trumpets. We also find that the thermofield double state of DSSYK is generated by a pair of baby universe operators, which corresponds to a double trumpet. This can be thought of as a concrete realization of the idea of ER=EPR.</description>

Extending this to six dimensions, the six-dimensional 't Hooft symbols can be constructed using the isomorphism between the Lorentz group $Spin(6)$ and the unitary group $SU(4)$. We demonstrate that the six-dimensional self-dual structures governed by the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations can be elegantly organized using these generalized 't Hooft symbols. We also present a systematic method for constructing Hermitian Yang-Mills instantons from spin connections on six-dimensional manifolds using the generalized 't Hooft symbols. We provide a thorough analysis of the topological invariants such as instanton and Euler numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of Einstein gravity with vanishing cosmological constant subjected to conformal boundary conditions. Our focus is on comparing the series of subextensive terms to predictions from thermal effective field theory, with which we find agreement for the boundary theory on a spatial sphere, hyperbolic space, and flat space. We calculate the leading Wilson coefficients and observe that the first subextensive correction to the free energy is negative. This violates a conjectured bound on this coefficient in quantum field theory, which we interpret as a signal that gravity does not fully decouple in the putative boundary dual.</description>

Abstract: We construct a novel solution in the low energy limit of heterotic string theory describing accelerating charged and rotating black holes with NUT parameter. Some aspects of the new spacetime are discussed, such as locations of horizons, ergoregions, conic singularity, closed timelike curves, and area temperature product. We find some of the properties resemble the ones belong to accelerating Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT spacetime.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization from irrelevant deformations induced by the stress-energy tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal O$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, the deformations of Lagrangians for scalar field theories are performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on quantum decoherence during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.09949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since inflationary perturbations must generically couple to all degrees of freedom present in the early Universe, it is more realistic to view these fluctuations as an open quantum system interacting with an environment. Then, on very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad equation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system, as well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of curvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations constrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the interaction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes by the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths. Therefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur without altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify all scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the case in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show that this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the power spectrum is quasi scale invariant. In that case, the presence of the environment improves the fit to the data for some inflationary models but deteriorates it for others. This clearly demonstrates that decoherence is not only of theoretical importance but can also be crucial for astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: Using the relation between four manifolds and topological modular form (TMF) from the six dimensional approach, we exhibit fiber sum formulas for infinite families of smooth spin four manifolds associated to compactifications of free and interacting 6d (1,0) SCFTs. We find that even the free theories have nontrivial fiber sum formulas and their forms are sensitive to an individual theory and parameters of four-manifolds. Furthermore, we reinforce the conjecture of Stolz and Teichner by expanding its evidence.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum complexity of bosonic oscillator systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the pioneering work of Nielsen and collaborators, the length of the minimal geodesic in a geometric realization of a suitable operator space provides a measure of the quantum complexity of an operation. Compared with the original concept of complexity based on the minimal number of gates required to construct the desired operation as a product, this geometrical approach amounts to a more concrete and computable definition, but its evaluation is nontrivial in systems with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The geometrical formulation can more easily be evaluated by considering the geometry associated with a suitable finite-dimensional group generated by a small number of relevant operators of the system. In this way, the method has been applied in particular to the harmonic oscillator, which is also of interest in the present paper. However, subtle and previously unrecognized issues of group theory can lead to unforeseen complications, motivating a new formulation that remains on the level of the underlying Lie algebras for most of the required steps. Novel insights about complexity can thereby be found in a low-dimensional setting, with the potential of systematic extensions to higher dimensions as well as interactions. Specific examples include the quantum complexity of various target unitary operators associated with a harmonic oscillator, inverted harmonic oscillator, and coupled harmonic oscillators. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comment on the so-called negative-result experiments (also known as null measurements, interaction-free measurements, and so on) in quantum mechanics (QM), in the light of the new general understanding of the quantum-measurement processes, proposed recently. All experiments of this kind (null-measurements) can be understood as improper measurements with an intentionally biased detector set up, which introduces exclusion or selection of certain events. The prediction on the state of a microscopic system under study based on a null measurement, is sometimes dramatically described as ``wave-function collapse without any microsystem-detector interactions". Though certainly correct, such a prediction is just a consequence of the standard QM laws, not different from the situation in the so-called state-preparation procedure. Another closely related concept is the (first-class or) repeatable measurements. The verification of the prediction made by a null-measurement requires eventually a standard unbiased measurement involving the microsystem-macroscopic detector interactions, which are nonadiabatic, irreversible processes of signal amplification.</description>

      <title>The number of fundamental constants from a spacetime-based perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09249v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Duff, Okun, and Veneziano's divergent views on the number of fundamental constants and argue that the issue can be set to rest by having spacetime as the starting point. This procedure disentangles the resolution in what depends on the assumed spacetime (whether relativistic or not) from the theories built over it. By defining that the number of fundamental constants equals the minimal number of independent standards necessary to express all observables, as assumed by Duff, Okun, and Veneziano, it is shown that the same units fixed by the apparatuses used to construct the spacetimes are enough to express all observables of the physical laws defined over them. As a result, the number of fundamental constants equals two in Galilei spacetime and one in relativistic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Imprint of massive neutrinos on Persistent Homology of large-scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the Persistent Homology technique and its complementary representations,
  we examine the footprint of summed neutrino mass ($M_{\nu}$) in the various density fields simulated by the publicly available Quijote suite. The evolution of topological features by utilizing the super-level filtration on three-dimensional density fields at zero redshift, reveals a remarkable benchmark for constraining the cosmological parameters, particularly $M_{\nu}$ and $\sigma_8$. The abundance of independent closed surfaces (voids) compared to the connected components (clusters) and independent loops (filaments), is more sensitive to the presence of $M_{\nu}$ for $R=5$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ irrespective of whether using the total matter density field ($m$) or CDM+baryons field ($cb$). Reducing the degeneracy between $M_{\nu}$ and $\sigma_8$ is achieved via Persistent Homology for the $m$ field but not for the $cb$ field. The uncertainty of $M_{\nu}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence interval from the joint analysis of Persistent Homology vectorization for the $m$ and $cb$ fields smoothed by $R=5$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=0$ reaches $0.0152$ eV and $0.1242$ eV, respectively. Noticing the use of the 3-dimensional underlying density field at $z=0$, the mentioned uncertainties can be treated as the theoretical lower limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the high-energy behavior of the elastic scattering amplitude using two distinct unitarization schemes: the eikonal and the $U$-matrix. Our analysis begins with a formalism involving solely Pomerons, incorporating pion-loop insertions in the Pomeron trajectory representing the nearest singularity generated by $t$-channel unitarity. Subsequently, we explore a scenario that includes the presence of an Odderon. In our analyses, we explore the tension between the TOTEM and the ATLAS measurements for $\sigma_{tot}$ and $d\sigma/dt$ at 7, 8, and 13 TeV, and the subsequent implications for the properties of both the Pomeron and Odderon. Our results show that the Odderon phase factor $\xi_{\Bbb O}= -1$ is favored in both unitarization schemes, supporting an Odderon with a phase opposite to that of other crossing-odd components of the scattering amplitude. More interestingly, this specific phase factor stands as the sole one that aligns with results consistent with a non-zero Odderon coupling.</description>

      <title>Stability of f(Q,B) gravity via Dynamical System Approach: a Comprehensive Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the cosmological stability of $f(Q, B)$ gravity using a dynamical system approach, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar and $B$ represents the boundary term. We determine the model parameters of $f(Q, B)$ through Bayesian statistical analysis, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. This analysis incorporates numerical solutions and observational data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the extended Pantheon$^+$ dataset, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. Our findings reveal a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model, corresponding to the de Sitter phase, which is consistent with current observations of the Universe dominated by dark energy (DE) and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion. Additionally, we utilize Centre Manifold Theory to examine the stability of this critical point, providing deeper insights into the behavior of the model. The cosmological implications of $f(Q, B)$ gravity indicate a smooth transition in the deceleration parameters from deceleration to acceleration phase, underscoring the potential of the model to describe the evolution of the Universe. Our results suggest that the $f(Q, B)$ model presents a viable alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, effectively capturing the observed acceleration of the Universe and offering a robust framework for explaining the dynamics of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable states of quantum many-body systems with confinement offer a means to simulate false vacuum phenomenology, including non-equilibrium dynamical processes like decay by nucleation, in truncated limits. Recent work has examined the decay process in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spins and superfluids. In this paper, we study nucleation dynamics in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with Rydberg interactions, using both numerical simulations and analytic modeling. We apply a staggered local detuning field to generate the metastable and ground states. Our efforts focus on two dynamical regimes: decay and annealing. In the first, we corroborate the phenomenological decay rate scaling and determine the associated parameter range for the decay process; in the second, we uncover and elucidate a procedure to anneal the metastable state from the initial to the final system, with intermediate nucleation events. We further propose experimental protocols to prepare the required states and perform quenches on near-term neutral atom quantum simulators, examining the experimental feasibility of our proposed setup and parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: Metastable states arise in a range of quantum systems and can be observed in various dynamical scenarios, including decay, bubble nucleation, and long-lived oscillations. The phenomenology of metastable states has been examined in quantum many-body systems, notably in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spin systems and superfluids. In this paper, we study long-lived oscillations of metastable and ground states in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with long-range Rydberg interactions. We use a staggered local detuning field to achieve confinement. Using theoretical and numerical models, we identify novel spectral signatures of quasiparticle oscillations distinct to antiferromagnetic neutral atom systems and interpret them using a classical energy model of short-range meson repulsion. Finally, we evaluate the experimental accessibility of our proposed setup on current neutral-atom platforms and discuss experimental feasibility and constraints.</description>

      <title>The Renormalization Group for Large-Scale Structure: Origin of Galaxy Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group equations for large-scale structure (RG-LSS) describe how the bias and stochastic (noise) parameters -- both of matter and biased tracers such as galaxies -- evolve as a function of the cutoff $\Lambda$ of the effective field theory. In previous work, we derived the RG-LSS equations for the bias parameters using the Wilson-Polchinski framework. Here, we extend these results to include stochastic contributions, corresponding to terms in the effective action that are higher order in the current $J$. We derive the general local interaction terms that describe stochasticity at all orders in perturbations, and a closed set of nonlinear RG equations for their coefficients. These imply that a single nonlinear bias term generates all stochastic moments through RG evolution. Further, the evolution is controlled by a different, lower scale than the nonlinear scale. This has implications for the optimal choice of the renormalization scale when comparing the theory with data to obtain cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>Summing Gravitational Effects from Loops of Inflationary Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a procedure for re-summing the large logarithms induced in gravity by loops of inflationary scalars. We first show how the scalar can be integrated out of the field equations in the presence of constant graviton field. We then extend this result to a fully conserved form which explains the need for a finite renormalization of the cosmological constant which was previously inferred from explicit computation. A variant of the renormalization group turns out to explain the large logarithmic corrections revealed by explicit computation in the electric field strength of gravitational radiation and in the potentials which characterize the response to a point mass. The implications for graviton loops are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <title>Robustness of inflation to kinetic inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large inhomogeneities in both the inflaton field and its momentum. We find that in general, large kinetic perturbations reduce the number of e-folds of inflation. In particular, we observe that inflationary models with sub-Planckian characteristic scales are not robust even to kinetic energy densities that are sub-dominant to the potential energy density, unless the initial field configuration is sufficiently far from the minimum. This strengthens the results of our previous work. In inflationary models with super-Planckian characteristic scales, despite a reduction in the number of e-folds, inflation is robust even when the potential energy density is initially sub-dominant. For the cases we study, the robustness of inflation strongly depends on whether the inflaton field is driven into the reheating phase by the inhomogeneous scalar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Potential of the Polyakov Loop in SU(3) Quenched Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we study for the first time the effective potential of the Polyakov loop $\langle P \rangle$ at finite temperature, i.e., the thermodynamic potential, in the field-theoretical way. In the framework of the reweighting method in lattice QCD, we express the effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(\langle P \rangle)$ using the expectation value without a source term. In particular, we consider the most difficult and interesting case of vacuum coexistence at the critical temperature $T_c$. We adopt SU(3) quenched lattice QCD on $48^3 \times 6$ at $\beta$= 5.89379, which corresponds exactly to the critical temperature $T_c$ of the deconfinement phase transition, and use 200,000 Monte Carlo configurations. After categorizing the gauge configurations into one $Z_3$-symmetric and three $Z_3$-broken vacua each, we perform a vacuum-associated reweighting method, using the gauge configurations around each vacuum separately. Finally, we obtain the Polyakov-loop effective potential, which is well depicted around the $Z_3$-symmetric and $Z_3$-broken vacua.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity by introducing an arbitrary coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and matter Lagrangian $L_m$ in the Lagrangian density $f$ of the theory, which thus leads to the $f\left(Q,L_m\right)$ theory. This generalisation encompasses Coincident General Relativity (CGR), and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR (STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the theory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study of the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the presence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are investigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this direction, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for several choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, and $f(Q,L_m)=- \alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, respectively. Comparative analyses with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the observational implications of the models are investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Three Generations and a Trio of Trialities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the Standard Model's $\mathfrak{su}(3)\oplus \mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)$ internal symmetries within the triality symmetries $\mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{H}) \oplus \mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{O})$. From here, the corresponding Standard Model group action is applied to the triality triple $\left( \Psi_+, \Psi_-,V\right)$ for $\Psi_+, \Psi_-, V \in \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$. Together, $\Psi_+$ and $\Psi_-$ provide the correct irreducible representations for two generations. Owing to a certain Cartan Factorization, which we define, $V$ provides the irreducible representations for a third generation. Said more explicitly in another way, division algebraic multiplication merges a third generation of spinor representations into a set of scalar bosons. This set of scalar bosons includes the familiar Standard Model Higgs representation.</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove an SPT-LSM theorem: any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</description>
