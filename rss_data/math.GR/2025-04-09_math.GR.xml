      <title>Normal subgroups and permutation characters: a correction to a proof of Klingen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. For subgroups $U$ and $V$ let $1_U^G$ and $1_V^G$ be the permutation characters for the action of $G$ on the right cosets of $U$ and $V$, respectively. Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Norbert Klingen, in his book, shows that if $1_U^G=1_V^G$, then $1_{NU}^G=1_{NV}^G$. We give a counterexample to an argument in his proof and we give a new proof of this statement.</description>

Abstract: P. Das, A. Ghosh and T. Aziz has given in \cite[Theorem 3.15]{ADG} a result on statistically characterized subgroups of the circle group $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$, which answers, together with \cite[Corollary 2.4]{DG24}, questions of \cite{DDB} and \cite{DG25}. Here we give a completely different and much shorter proof of these results.</description>

      <title>A spine for the decorated Teichm\"uller space of a punctured non-orientable surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on work of Harer \cite{Ha86}, we construct a spine for the decorated Teichm\"uller space of a non-orientable surface with at least one puncture and negative Euler characteristic. We compute its dimension, and show that the deformation retraction onto this spine is equivariant with respect to the pure mapping class group of the non-orientable surface. As a consequence, we obtain a model for the classifying space for proper actions of the pure mapping class group of a punctured non-orientable surface, which is of minimal dimension in the case there is a single puncture.</description>

      <title>Group Order is in QCMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that verifying the order of a finite group given as a black-box is in the complexity class QCMA. This solves an open problem asked by Watrous in 2000 in his seminal paper on quantum proofs and directly implies that the Group Non-Membership problem is also in the class QCMA, which further proves a conjecture proposed by Aaronson and Kuperberg in 2006. Our techniques also give improved quantum upper bounds on the complexity of many other group-theoretical problems, such as group isomorphism in black-box groups.</description>

      <title>Finiteness properties of asymptotically rigid handlebody groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce asymptotically rigid mapping class groups of handlebodies and determine their finiteness properties, which vary depending on the space of ends of the underlying handlebody. As it turns out, in some cases, the homology of these groups coincides with the stable homology of handlebody groups, as studied by Hatcher and Wahl.</description>

      <title>New cosystolic high-dimensional expanders from KMS groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosystolic expansion is a high-dimensional generalization of the Cheeger constant for simplicial complexes. Originally, this notion was motivated by the fact that it implies the topological overlapping property, but more recently it was shown to be connected to problems in theoretical computer science such as list agreement expansion and agreement expansion in the low soundness regime.
  There are only a few constructions of high-dimensional cosystolic expanders and, in dimension larger than $2$, the only known constructions prior to our work were (co-dimension 1)-skeletons of quotients of affine buildings. In this paper, we give the first coset complex construction of cosystolic expanders for an arbitrary dimension. Our construction is more symmetric and arguably more elementary than the previous constructions relying on quotients of affine buildings.
  The coset complexes we consider arise from finite quotients of Kac--Moody--Steinberg (KMS) groups and are known as KMS complexes. KMS complexes were introduced in recent work by Grave de Peralta and Valentiner-Branth where it was shown that they are local-spectral expanders. Our result is that KMS complexes, satisfying some minor condition, give rise to infinite families of bounded degree cosystolic expanders of arbitrary dimension and for any finitely generated Abelian coefficient group.
  This result is achieved by observing that proper links of KMS complexes are joins of opposition complexes in spherical buildings. In order to show that these opposition complexes are coboundary expanders, we develop a new method for constructing cone functions by iteratively adding sets of vertices. Hence we show that the links of KMS complexes are coboundary expanders. Using the prior local-to-global results, we obtain cosystolic expansion for the (co-dimension 1)-skeletons of the KMS complexes.</description>

      <title>Geometries with trialities arising from linear spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A triality is a sort of super-symmetry that exchanges the types of the elements of an incidence geometry in cycles of length three. Although geometries with trialities exhibit fascinating behaviors, their construction is challenging, making them rare in the literature. To understand trialities more deeply, it is crucial to have a wide variety of examples at hand. In this article, we introduce a general method for constructing various rank-three incidence systems with trialities. Specifically, for any rank two incidence system $\Gamma$, we define its triangle complex $\Delta(\Gamma)$, a rank three incidence system whose elements consist of three copies of the flags (pairs of incident elements) of $\Gamma$. This triangle complex always admits a triality that cyclically permutes the three copies. We then explore in detail the properties of the triangle complex when $\Gamma$ is a linear space, including flag-transitivity, the existence of dualities, and connectivity properties. As a consequence of our work, this construction yields the first infinite family of thick, flag-transitive and residually connected geometries with trialities but no dualities.</description>

      <title>Positive 3-braids, Khovanov homology and Garside theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Khovanov homology is a powerful invariant of oriented links that categorifies the Jones polynomial. Nevertheless, computing Khovanov homology of a given link remains challenging in general with current techniques. In this work we focus on links that are the closure of positive 3-braids. Starting with a classification of conjugacy classes of 3-braids arising from the Garside structure of braid groups, we compute, for any closed positive 3-braid, the first four columns (homological degree) and the three lowest rows (quantum degree) of the associated Khovanov homology table. Moreover, the number of rows and columns we can describe increases with the infimum of the positive braid (a Garside theoretical notion). We will show how to increase the infimum of a 3-braid to its maximal possible value by a conjugation, maximizing the number of cells in the Khovanov homology of its closure that can be determined, and show that this can be done in linear time.</description>

      <title>On the homology of special unitary groups over polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we answer the homotopy invariance question for the ''smallest'' non-isotrivial group-scheme over $\mathbb{P}^1$, obtaining a result, which is not contained in previous works due to Knudson and Wendt. More explicitly, let $\mathcal{G}=\mathrm{SU}_{3,\mathbb{P}^1}$ be the (non-isotrivial) non-split group-scheme over $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined from the standard (isotropic) hermitian form in three variables. In this article, we prove that there exists a natural homomorphism $\mathrm{PGL}_2(F) \to \mathcal{G}(F[t])$ that induces isomorphisms $H_*(\mathrm{PGL}_2(F), \mathbb{Z}) \to H_*(\mathcal{G}(F[t]), \mathbb{Z})$. Then we study the rational homology of $\mathcal{G}(F[t,t^{-1}])$, by previously describing suitable fundamental domains for certain arithmetic subgroups of $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise an explicit method for computing combinatorial formulae for Hadamard products of certain rational generating functions. The latter arise naturally when studying so-called ask zeta functions of direct sums of modules of matrices or class- and orbit-counting zeta functions of direct products of nilpotent groups. Our method relies on shuffle compatibility of coloured permutation statistics and coloured quasisymmetric functions, extending recent work of Gessel and Zhuang.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Relation Classification of the Isomorphism Types of Absolutely Indecomposable (resp. Absolutely Simple) Modules in Finite Group Modular Representation Theory with a Green Theory Invariants "Compatibility"</title>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, let $F$ be a field of prime $p$ order and let $\bar{F}$ be an algebraic closure of $F$. In this context, we develop an equivalence relation on the set of isomorphic types of indecomposable (resp. simple) $\bar{F}G$-modules. Note that here all indecomposable (resp. simple) modules are absolutely indecomposable (resp. simple). Also we show that members of the same equivalence have related Green Theory invariants. This work completes and extends previous results of the author.</description>

      <title>Solenoids of Split Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solenoids induced by split sequences are introduced, as the inverse limit object of a sequence of fold maps. The topology of a solenoid is explored, and it is established that solenoids have naturally arising singular foliated structures. Our main goal is to answer the question: ``When is a solenoid minimal, both in a topological sense, and a measure theoretic sense?" To aid this, we introduce the notions of leaves, partial leaves and transversals of a solenoid and explore their properties. A combinatorial criterion for topological minimality of a solenoid, is introduced. The primary tool we construct to study dynamics of solenoids is contained in the following theorem: When a given solenoid $X$ doesn't contain finite partial leaves, the space of transverse measures of $X$, denoted $TM(X)$, is equal to the inverse limit of a certain sequence of linear maps on convex cones. We use this machinery to show that $TM(X)$ is a finite dimensional cone, and then to provide a combinatorial criterion called ``Semi-Normality" that allows us to recognize a wide class of uniquely ergodic solenoids.</description>
