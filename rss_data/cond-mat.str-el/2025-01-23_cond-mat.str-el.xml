      <title>Field-induced phase transitions in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model: A sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study and possible application to $\alpha$-RuCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frustrated magnet $\alpha$-RuCl3 is one of the prime candidates for realizing a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). However, the existence of a field-induced intermediate QSL phase in this material remains under debate. Here, we employ sign-free numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) model on the honeycomb lattice with $K=-2J$ under an applied magnetic field along the z-direction. Our findings reveal that the system undergoes a direct quantum phase transition from a zigzag magnetically ordered phase to a spin-polarized phase at zero temperature, which belongs to the 3D XY universality class. At finite temperatures, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition line separates the spin-polarized phase from a quasi-long-range ordered state, eventually terminating at the quantum critical point. Our results convincingly show that there is no intermediate QSL phase in the KH model with a z-direction magnetic field, which we believe will shed important light on understanding experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl3.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Spin-Triplet Excitonic Insulator in the Ultra-Quantum Limit of HfTe5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than fifty years ago, excitonic insulators, formed by the pairing of electrons and holes due to Coulomb interactions, were first predicted. Since then, excitonic insulators have been observed in various classes of materials, including quantum Hall bilayers, graphite, transition metal chalcogenides, and more recently in moire superlattices. In these excitonic insulators, an electron and a hole with the same spin bind together and the resulting exciton is a spin singlet. Here, we report the experimental observation of a spin-triplet exciton insulator in the ultra-quantum limit of a three-dimensional topological material HfTe5. We observe that the spin-polarized zeroth Landau bands, dispersing along the field direction, cross each other beyond a characteristic magnetic field in HfTe5, forming the one-dimensional Weyl mode. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of a gap of about 250 {\mu}eV when the field surpasses a critical threshold. By performing the material-specific modeling, we identify this gap as a consequence of a spin-triplet exciton formation, where electrons and holes with opposite spin form bound states, and the translational symmetry is preserved. The system reaches charge neutrality following the gap opening, as evidenced by the zero Hall conductivity over a wide magnetic field range (10 - 72 T). Our finding of the spin-triplet excitonic insulator paves the way for studying novel spin transport including spin superfluidity, spin Josephson currents, and Coulomb drag of spin currents in analogy to the transport properties associated with the layer pseudospin in quantum Hall bilayers.</description>

      <title>Tensor cross interpolation approach for quantum impurity problems based on the weak-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm to solve equilibrium quantum impurity problems with high precision based on the weak-coupling expansion. The TCI algorithm, a kind of active learning method, factorizes high-dimensional integrals that appear in the perturbative expansion into a product of low-dimensional ones, enabling us to evaluate higher-order terms efficiently. This method is free from the sign problem which quantum Monte Carlo methods sometimes suffer from, and allows one to directly calculate the free energy. We benchmark the TCI impurity solver on an exactly solvable impurity model, and find good agreement with the exact solutions. We also incorporate the TCI impurity solver into the dynamical mean-field theory to solve the Hubbard model, and show that the metal-to-Mott insulator transition is correctly described with comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo methods. Behind the effectiveness of the TCI approach for quantum impurity problems lies the fact that the integrands in the weak-coupling expansion naturally have a low-rank structure in the tensor-train representation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Lattice Effect Originated Metal-Insulator Transition in FeSe$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electrical transport, and magnetic properties of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ ($\it{x}$ = 1.14, 1.18, 1.23, 1.28, and 1.32) to unravel the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition observed in these systems. For this, we systematically evaluated the structural parameters of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ as a function of Se concentration and temperature. We observe increased lattice constants and cell volume with increased Se concentration. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent XRD studies suggest unusual lattice change around the metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature of the respective compositions. This remarkable observation suggests that the anomalous lattice effect originates the MI transition in these systems. Additionally, our density of states (DOS) calculations on FeSe$_{1.14}$ qualitatively explain the MI transition, as the low-temperature (50 K) structure DOS suggests a metallic nature and the high-temperature (300 K) structure DOS shows a gap near the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Correlation between magnetism and the Verwey transition in magnetite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seeking to unravel the enigmatic Verwey transition and its interplay with magnetism, we have conducted comprehensive measurements on the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and magnetic moment of stoichiometric and doped-magnetite single crystals at temperatures reaching 1000 K. These investigations have allowed us to identify the Curie temperature, $T_C$, and other characteristic temperatures of the electrical resistivity. Remarkably, we have identified correlations between these temperatures and the Verwey temperature, $T_V$, indicating that the electrical transport properties and the mechanism of the Verwey transition are closely related to the magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Fully-frustrated octahedral antiferromagnet: emergent complexity in external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.</description>

      <title>Bound states and deconfined spinons in the dynamical structure factor of the $J_1 - J_2$ spin-1 chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach, we study the dynamical structure factor of the $J_1 - J_2$ spin-1 chain. As $J_2$ increases, the magnon mode develops incommensurability. The system undergoes a first-order transition at $J_2 = 0.76 J_1$, and at that point, domain walls lead to a continuum of fractional quasi-particles or spinons. By studying small variations in $J_2$ around the transition point, we observe the confinement of spinons into bound states in the spectral function and find a smooth evolution of the spectrum into magnon modes away from the phase transition. We employ the single-mode approximation to accurately account for the dispersion of the magnon mode away from the phase transition and describe the associated continua and bound states. We extend the single-mode approximation to describe the dispersion of a spinon at the phase transition point and obtain its dispersion throughout the Brillouin zone. This allows us to relate the incommensurability at and around the transition point to the competition between a negative nearest-neighbour hopping amplitude and a positive next-nearest-neighbour one for the domain wall.</description>

      <title>Eliashberg Theory and Superfluid Stiffness of Band-Off-Diagonal Pairing in Twisted Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, band-off-diagonal superconductivity has been proposed [Nat. Commun. 14, 7134 (2023)] as a candidate pairing state for twisted graphene systems. Based on mean-field theory, it was shown that it not only naturally emerges from both intervalley electron-phonon coupling and fluctuations of the nearby correlated insulator, but also exhibits nodal and gapped regimes as indicated by scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. Here we study band-off-diagonal pairing within Eliashberg theory. We show that despite the additional frequency dependence, the leading-order description of both intervalley coherent fluctuations or intervalley phonons exhibits a symmetry prohibiting admixture of an intraband component to the interband pairing state. It is found that even- and odd-frequency pairing mix, which originates from the reduced number of flavor degrees of freedom in the normal state. From analytic continuation, we obtain the electronic spectral function showing that, also within Eliashberg theory, the interband nature leads to an enhanced spectral weight below the order-parameter energy compared to band-diagonal pairing. Finally, we also study the superfluid stiffness of band-off-diagonal pairing, taking into account multi-band and quantum geometry effects. It is shown that for $s$-wave and chiral momentum dependencies, conventionally leading to fully gapped phases, an interband structure reduces the temperature scale below which the stiffness saturates. Depending on parameters, for the chiral state, this scale can even be suppressed all the way to zero temperature leading to a complex competition of multiple dispersive and geometrical contributions. Our results show that interband pairing might also be able to explain more recent stiffness measurements in the superconducting state of twisted multilayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new results on classical, Machian, fractons. For fractons of strictly bounded Machian range, we show that local clusters do not exhibit chaos while the global state breaks ergodicity. We show that the many fracton evolution characteristically exhibits a central time or Janus point and thus a generic non-equilibrium arrow of time as discussed previously in the context of classical Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning electronic structure: millielectron volt accuracy for sub-million-atom moir\'e semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of density functional theory (DFT) with machine learning enables efficient \textit{ab initio} electronic structure calculations for ultra-large systems. In this work, we develop a transfer learning framework tailored for long-wavelength moir\'e systems. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we adopt a two-step transfer learning strategy: (1) the model is pre-trained on a large dataset of computationally inexpensive non-twisted structures until convergence, and (2) the network is then fine-tuned using a small set of computationally expensive twisted structures. Applying this method to twisted MoTe$_2$, the neural network model generates the resulting Hamiltonian for a 1000-atom system in 200 seconds, achieving a mean absolute error below 0.1 meV. To demonstrate $O(N)$ scalability, we model nanoribbon systems with up to 0.25 million atoms ($\sim9$ million orbitals), accurately capturing edge states consistent with predicted Chern numbers. This approach addresses the challenges of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, offering a viable alternative to conventional DFT and enabling the exploration of electronic topology in large scale moir\'e systems towards simulating realistic device architectures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase diagram of cuprates and universal scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider the magnetic field phase diagram of hole-doped high-$T_c$ cuprates, which has been given much less attention than the temperature diagram. In the framework of the {\it pairon model}, we show that the two characteristic energies, the pair binding energy (the gap $\Delta_p$) and the condensation energy ($\beta_c$) resulting from pair correlations, give rise to two major magnetic fields, the upper critical field $B_{c2}$ and a second field, $B_{pg}$, associated with the pseudogap (PG). The latter implies a second length scale in addition to the coherence length, characteristic of incoherent pairs. Universal scaling laws for both $B_{c2}$ and $B_{pg}$ are derived: $B_{c2}$ scales with the critical temperature, $B_{c2}/T_c\simeq 1.65$ T/K, in agreement with many experiments, and $B_{pg}$ has a similar scaling with respect to $T^*$. Finally, Fermi arcs centered on the nodal directions are predicted to appear as a function of magnetic field, an effect testable experimentally.</description>

      <title>A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sunny is a Julia package designed to serve the needs of the quantum magnetism community. It supports the specification of a very broad class of spin models and a diverse suite of numerical solvers. These include powerful methods for simulating spin dynamics both in and out of equilibrium. Uniquely, it features a broad generalization of classical and semiclassical approaches to SU(N) coherent states, which is useful for studying systems exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling or local entanglement effects. Sunny also offers a well-developed framework for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor, enabling direct comparison with scattering experiments. Ease of use is a priority, with tools for symmetry-guided modeling and interactive visualization.</description>

      <title>Symmetry fractionalization, mixed-anomalies and dualities in quantum spin models with generalized symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gauging of higher-form finite Abelian symmetries and their sub-groups in quantum spin models in spatial dimensions $d=2$ and 3. Doing so, we naturally uncover gauged models with dual higher-group symmetries and potential mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We demonstrate that the mixed anomalies manifest as the symmetry fractionalization of higher-form symmetries participating in the mixed anomaly. Gauging is realized as an isomorphism or duality between the bond algebras that generate the space of quantum spin models with the dual generalized symmetry structures. We explore the mapping of gapped phases under such gauging related dualities for 0-form and 1-form symmetries in spatial dimension $d=2$ and 3. In $d=2$, these include several non-trivial dualities between short-range entangled gapped phases with 0-form symmetries and 0-form symmetry enriched Higgs and (twisted) deconfined phases of the gauged theory with possible symmetry fractionalizations. Such dualities also imply strong constraints on several unconventional, i.e., deconfined or topological transitions. In $d=3$, among others, we find, dualities between topological orders via gauging of 1-form symmetries. Hamiltonians self-dual under gauging of 1-form symmetries host emergent non-invertible symmetries, realizing higher-categorical generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev honeycomb model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We microscopically construct an abelian mutual Chern-Simons lattice gauge theory for magnetic field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev model and obtain a complete characterization of the phases, including their quasiparticles. At low fields for both ferro and antiferromagnetic (FM(AFM)) Kitaev interactions, we demonstrate nonabelian Ising topological order (ITO), and explicitly construct the Majorana anyon as an intrinsic excitation -- a twist defect in our \textit{abelian} gauge theory. For the AFM case, an abelian chiral phase appears at intermediate fields with trivial topological order and fermionic bulk excitations. Remarkably, both the ITO phase and the intermediate phase have the same chiral central charge $c=1/2,$ implying no change in the quantized thermal Hall response across the transition. For the FM case, there is a direct transition from ITO to a partially polarized nontopological phase. Our study completes the proof of Kitaev's original proposal of the low-field ITO with $c=1/2$ going beyond his mean-field arguments by including the crucial effect of the gauge fluctuations, and provides a resolution of the debate surrounding the intermediate field phase in the AFM case.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <title>Dipole representation of composite fermions in graphene quantum Hall systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect has been experimentally observed in graphene in the fourth Landau level ($n = 3$). This paper is motivated by recent studies regarding the possibility of pairing and the nature of the ground state in this system. By extending the dipole representation of composite fermions, we adapt this framework to the context of graphene's quantum Hall systems, with a focus on half-filled Landau levels. We derive an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the key symmetry of half-filled Landau levels, particularly particle-hole symmetry. At the Fermi level, the energetic instability of the dipole state is influenced by the interplay between topology and symmetry, driving the system towards a critical state. We explore the possibility that this critical state stabilizes into one of the paired states with well-defined pairing solutions. However, our results demonstrate that the regularized state which satisfies boost invariance at Fermi level and lacks well-defined pairing instabilities emerges as energetically more favorable. Therefore, we find no well-defined pairing instabilities of composite fermions in the dipole representation in the half-filled fourth Landau level ($ n = 3 $) of electrons in graphene. Although the theory of composite fermions has its limitations, further research is required to investigate other possible configurations. We discuss the consistency of our results with experimental and numerical studies, and their relevance for future research efforts.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical and dynamical properties of the XXZ bilayer with long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z&lt;1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>

Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

Abstract: Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories, discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories arising in the Standard Model, have become important platforms for exploring non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. Recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model, including its spectral properties, structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing double-logarithmic-in-time growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within numerically accessible system sizes.</description>

      <title>UV complete local field theory of persistent symmetry breaking in 2+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking can persist at all temperatures in certain biconical $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vector models when the underlying field theories are ultraviolet complete. So far, the existence of such theories has been established in fractional dimensions for local but nonunitary models or in 2+1 dimensions but for nonlocal models. Here, we study local models at zero and finite temperature directly in 2+1 dimensions employing functional methods. At zero temperature, we establish that our approach describes the quantum critical behaviour with high accuracy for all $N\geq 2$. We then exhibit the mechanism of discrete symmetry breaking from $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2\to \mathrm{O}(N)$ for increasing temperature near the biconical critical point when $N$ is finite but large. We calculate the corresponding finite-temperature phase diagram and further show that the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem is fully respected within this approach, i.e., symmetry breaking only occurs in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector. Finally, we determine the critical $N$ above which this phenomenon can be observed to be $N_c \approx 15$.</description>
