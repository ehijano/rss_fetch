      <title>Mean-field analysis for cognitively-grounded opinion dynamics with confirmation bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how individuals' beliefs and attitudes evolve within a population is crucial for explaining social phenomena such as polarization and consensus formation. We explore a persuasive arguments model incorporating confirmation bias, where individuals preferentially accept information aligning with their existing beliefs. By employing a mean-field approach, widely used in statistical physics, we simplify complex processes of argument exchange within the population. Our analysis proceeds by projecting the model onto continuous opinion dynamics and further reducing it through mean-field reasoning. The findings highlight the robustness of mean-field predictions and their compatibility with agent-based simulations, capturing the transition from consensus to polarization induced by confirmation bias.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in the Kuramoto model with external forcing and higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is an important phenomenon in a wide variety of systems comprising interacting oscillatory units, whether natural (like neurons, biochemical reactions, cardiac cells) or artificial (like metronomes, power grids, Josephson junctions). The Kuramoto model provides a simple description of these systems and has been useful in their mathematical exploration. Here we investigate this model combining two common features that have been observed in many systems: external periodic forcing and higher-order interactions among the elements. We show that the combination of these ingredients leads to a very rich bifurcation scenario that produces 11 different asymptotic states of the system, with competition between forced and spontaneous synchronization. We found, in particular, that saddle-node, Hopf and homoclinic manifolds are duplicated in regions of parameter space where the unforced system displays bi-stability.</description>

      <title>Revisiting institutional punishment in the $N$-person prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conflict between individual and collective interests makes fostering cooperation in human societies a challenging task, requiring drastic measures such as the establishment of sanctioning institutions. These institutions are costly because they have to be maintained regardless of the presence or absence of offenders. Here we revisit some improvements to the standard $N$-person prisoner's dilemma formulation with institutional punishment in a well-mixed population, namely the elimination of overpunishment, the requirement of a minimum number of contributors to establish the sanctioning institution, and the sharing of its maintenance costs once this minimum number is reached. In addition, we focus on large groups or communities for which sanctioning institutions are ubiquitous. Using the replicator equation framework for an infinite population, we find that by sufficiently fining players who fail to contribute either to the public good or to the sanctioning institution, a population of contributors immune to invasion by these free riders can be established, provided that the contributors are sufficiently numerous. In a finite population, we use finite-size scaling to show that, for some parameter settings, demographic noise helps to fixate the strategy that contributes to the public good but not to the sanctioning institution even for infinitely large populations when, somewhat counterintuitively, its proportion in the initial population vanishes with a small power of the population size.</description>
