      <title>Inverse bubbles from broken supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the recent findings regarding inverse phase transitions in the early universe, we present the first natural realisation of this phenomenon within a supersymmetry-breaking sector. We demonstrate that inverse hydrodynamics, which is characterized by the fluid being aspired by the bubble wall rather than being pushed or dragged, is actually not limited to a phase of (re)heating but can also occur within the standard cooling cosmology. Through a numerical analysis of the phase transition, we establish a simple and generic criterion to determine its hydrodynamics based on the generalised pseudo-trace. Our results provide a proof of principle highlighting the need to account for these new fluid solutions when considering cosmological phase transitions and their phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Two-loop renormalisation of quark and gluon fields in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the contributions of CP-conserving operators in the dimension-six SMEFT to the two-loop renormalisation constants of quark and gluon fields in the $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$-scheme. Specifically, we consider the top-quark chromomagnetic operator and the triple gluon operator. We work with the background-field method, which allows us to extract the contribution of these operators to the two-loop running of the top mass and the strong coupling constant. We discuss in detail the mixing with the unphysical operators required for the renormalisation, and we present analytic results for the renormalisation constants of all relevant operators.</description>

      <title>Curvature Perturbations from First-Order Phase Transitions: Implications to Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a covariant formalism to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations during a first-order phase transition, addressing in particular their gauge dependence that have been overlooked so far. Our results reveal that non-covariant treatments employed in previous studies can substantially overestimate the production of primordial black holes and scalar-induced gravitational waves. Once gauge dependencies are properly accounted for, we find that both effects occur at significantly lower levels than previously estimated.</description>

      <title>LHC Signatures of the Generic Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector-boson fusion production of new Higgs bosons decaying into pairs of electroweak gauge bosons ($W^\pm W^\pm$, $WZ$ and $ZZ$) is a smoking-gun signature of the Georgi-Machacek (GM) Model. Notably, ATLAS has observed a $3.3\sigma$ excess in $W^\pm W^\pm$ at $\approx 450\,$GeV and a $2.8\sigma$ excess in the $WZ$ channel at $\approx 375\,$GeV, while CMS reported weaker-than-expected limits at these masses. However, the canonical custodial-symmetric GM Model cannot accommodate these signals, as it predicts mass degeneracy among the new gauge-philic Higgs bosons. To overcome this obstacle, we consider a generalized version of the GM Model without the custodial $SU(2)_C$ symmetry in the scalar potential. In the limit of small mixing among the Higgs bosons, the $W^\pm W^\pm$ and $WZ$ excesses can be explained by the doubly and singly-charged Higgs bosons originating primarily from the $Y=1$ triplet, while respecting the bounds from $ZZ$ searches. Furthermore, the neutral Higgs boson mostly contained in the $Y=0$ triplet can account for the excess at $\approx 152\,$GeV in associated di-photon production, while being consistent with constraints from vacuum stability and the Standard Model Higgs signal strength measurements.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Current in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical background electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter space. We show that having a constant electric field in de Sitter requires the photon to have a tachyonic mass proportional to the Hubble scale. This has physical implications for the induced Schwinger current which affect its IR behaviour. To study this we recompute the Schwinger current in de Sitter space for charged fermions and minimally coupled scalars imposing a physically consistent renormalization condition. We find a finite and positive Schwinger current even in the massless limit. This is in contrast to previous calculations in the literature which found a negative IR divergence. We also obtain the first result of the Schwinger current for a non-minimally coupled scalar, including for a conformally coupled scalar which we find has very similar behaviour to the fermion current. Our results may have physical implications for both magnetogenesis and inflationary dark matter production.</description>

      <title>Momentum Flow and Forces on Quarks in the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum conservation in the nucleon is examined in terms of continuous flow of the momentum density current (or in short, momentum flow), which receives contributions from both kinetic motion and interacting forces involving quarks and gluons. While quarks conduct momentum flow through their kinetic motion and the gluon scalar (anomaly) contributes via pure interactions, the gluon stress tensor has both effects. The quarks momentum flow encodes the information of the force density on them, and the momentum conservation allows to trace its origin to the gluon tensor and anomaly ("negative pressure"). From state-of-the-art lattice calculations and experimental fits on the form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, we exhibit pictures of the momentum flow and forces on the quarks in the nucleon. In particular, the anomaly contributes a critical attractive force with a strength similar to that of a QCD confinement potential.</description>

      <title>Production of doubly heavy baryon at the Muon-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study forecasts the production of doubly heavy baryons, $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Xi_{bc}$, and $\Xi_{bb}$, within the nonrelativistic QCD framework at the Muon-Ion Collider (MuIC). It examines two production mechanisms: photon-gluon fusion ($\gamma + g \to (QQ')[n] +\bar{Q} +\bar{Q'}$) and extrinsic heavy quark channels ($\gamma + Q \to (QQ')[n] + \bar{Q'}$), where $Q$ and $Q'$ denote heavy quarks ($c$ or $b$) and $(QQ')[n]$ represents a diquark in specific spin-color configurations. The diquark fragments into $\Xi_{QQ'}$ baryons with high probability. For $\Xi_{cc}$ and $\Xi_{bb}$, the relevant configurations are $[^1S_0]_{\textbf{6}}$ (spin-singlet and color-sextuplet) and $[^3S_1]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}}$ (spin-triplet and color-antitriplet). For $\Xi_{bc}$, the configurations are $[^1S_0]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}}$, $[^1S_0]_{\textbf{6}}$, $[^3S_1]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}}$, and $[^3S_1]_{\textbf{6}}$. The study compares total and differential cross-sections for these channels, highlighting their uncertainties. The results indicate that the extrinsic heavy quark channel, particularly the $[^3S_1]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}}$ configuration, dominates $\Xi_{QQ'}$ production, though other diquark states also contribute significantly. Using quark masses $m_c = 1.80 \pm 0.10$ GeV and $m_b = 5.1 \pm 0.20$ GeV, the study estimates annual event yields at MuIC ($\sqrt{s} = 1$ TeV, luminosity ${\mathcal L}\simeq 40$ ${\rm fb}^{-1}$) of $(3.67^{+1.29}_{-0.91}) \times 10^9$ for $\Xi_{cc}$, $(2.24^{+0.28}_{-0.20}) \times 10^8$ for $\Xi_{bc}$, and $(3.00^{+0.64}_{-0.56}) \times 10^6$ for $\Xi_{bb}$. These findings suggest that MuIC will significantly enhance our understanding of doubly heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Role of $a_0(980)$ in the decays $D^{0} \rightarrow K^{+} K^{-} \eta$ and $\pi^{+} \pi^{-} \eta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In present work, we study the reactions $D^{0} \rightarrow K^{+} K^{-} \eta$ and $D^0 \rightarrow \pi^{+} \pi^{-} \eta$, and find that the $a_0(980)$ state plays a dominant role. At the quark level, the external and internal $W$-emission mechanisms are taken into account, which can hadronize into the final states, and then the $a_0(980)$ state is generated from the final state interaction. Besides, the contributions of other intermediate resonances, such as $\rho(770)$ and $\phi(1020)$, are also considered. We make a combined fit of the invariant mass spectra measured by the Belle and BESIII Collaborations, where the results are in good agreement with the experiments, and the signal of the $a_0(980)$ shows great significance. Besides, the antisymmetry data for the production of the $a_0(980)^+$ and $a_0(980)^-$ is described well in the combined fit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of all available data on cross sections and spin-dependent observables for the $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0(1385)$, $\gamma n \to K^+ \Sigma^-(1385)$, and $\pi^+ p \to K^+ \Sigma^+(1385)$ reactions is performed within an effective Lagrangian framework. In addition to the $s$-channel $N$ exchange, $t$-channel $K$ and $K^\ast$ exchanges, $u$-channel $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$, and $\Sigma^\ast$ exchanges, and the interaction current, the $s$-channel contributions from a minimal set of $N$ and $\Delta$ resonances are included in constructing the reaction amplitudes to describe the data. The analysis reveals that all available data for both photon- and hadron-induced $K\Sigma(1385)$ production reactions can be simultaneously and satisfactorily reproduced when the contribution of the $s$-channel $\Delta(1930){5/2}^-$ resonance is taken into account. The reaction mechanisms, particularly the resonance contributions in each considered reaction, are thoroughly analyzed and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Reexamination of eccentricity scaling of elliptic flow and incomplete thermalization scenario in heavy-ion collisions at energies available at CERN Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we reexamine the formulation for extraction of Knudsen number ($K$), the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density ($\eta/s$), within the incomplete thermalization scenario, using eccentricity scaling of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of final state hadrons. Data on centrality dependence of charged hadron $v_{2}$ in Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions, measured by ALICE and CMS collaborations at LHC are analyzed for this purpose. Results have been compared using two different models of collision namely Glauber Monte Carlo and TRENTO. The measured $v_{2}$, even for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV most central Pb-Pb collisions is found to be below the ideal hydrodynamic limit by at least $15 \%$. Extracted $\eta/s$ of the medium exhibit heavy dependence on the employed initial conditions. Impact of the Pade approximants based alternative formulation of the functional relation between $v_{2}$ and $K$ are also investigated in detail. Our studies reconfirm the importance of clarifying the initial state configuration as well as the inbuilt ambiguities in employing the transport approach based on incomplete equilibrium in a strongly coupled regime at LHC.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Lorentz invariance violation in reactor neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reactor neutrino oscillation experiments reported precision measurements of $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ under the standard 3$\nu$ oscillation framework. However, inter-experiment consistency checks through the parameter goodness-of-fit test reveals proximity to the tension boundary, with the Double Chooz, RENO, and Daya Bay ensemble yielding $p_\text{PG}=0.14$ vs threshold $\alpha=0.1$. Anisotropic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can accommodate this tension by introducing a location-dependent angle $\theta^\text{LIV}$ relative to the earth's axis. It is found that anisotropic LIV improve the fit to data up to 1.9$\sigma$ confidence level significance, with the coefficient $\mathcal{A}^{C(0)}_{31} = 2.43\times 10^{-17}\text{ MeV}$ yielding the best fit, while Parameter Goodness-of-fit (PG) is significantly improved within the LIV formalism.</description>

      <title>A common origin of two accelerating universes: inflation and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum theory of inflaton and its decay product of various gauge boson pairs to investigate the preheating towards thermalized universe. The inflaton decay into gauge-boson pairs is shown to be inevitably accompanied by tachyon-mass-like correction to inflation potential that ultimately leads to an inflaton escape out of trapped local potential minimum towards the field infinity. This gives rise to a conversion mechanism of early inflationary acceleration to a quintessence dark energy acceleration at late stages of cosmic evolution. The success of the escape depends on how standard particles are incorporated into a scheme of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. New types of super-radiance mechanism that enhance the ending of preheating are identified and compared with the Dicke model.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $ q\bar q\to Z^* \to hA \to4\tau$ process within the lepton-specific 2HDM at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse light Higgs scalar and pseudoscalar associated hadro-production in the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-X (or lepton-specific) within the parameter space allowed by theoretical self-consistency requirements as well as the latest experimental constraints from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), precision data and $B$ physics. Over the viable regions of such a scenario, the Standard Model-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC in 2012 is the heavier CP-even state $H$. Furthermore, in the Type-X scenario, due to large $\tan\beta$, the lighter Higgs scalar $h$ and the pseudoscalar $A$ mainly decay into two $\tau$ leptons. Therefore, we concentrate on analysing the signal process $pp\to Z^{*} \to hA\to \tau^{+}\tau^{-}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to \ell \nu_\ell \ell \nu_\ell \tau_h \tau_h$ (where $\ell= e, \mu$ whereas $\tau_h$ represents the hadronic decay of the $\tau$) and explore the feasibility of conducting such a search at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}~=$ 14 TeV and a luminosity of $L~=~300~fb^{-1}$. To suppress the huge SM background, we confine ourselves to consider the fraction of signal events with two same-sign $\tau$ leptons further decaying into same-sign leptons while the other two $\tau$ leptons decay hadronically. We find that a combination of kinematical selection and machine learning (ML) analysis will yields significant sensitivity to this process at the end of the LHC Run 3.</description>

      <title>Timelike Compton scattering on a spin-0 target with kinematic twist-4 precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the kinematic twist-3 and 4 corrections to the leading order amplitude of timelike Compton scattering (TCS) on a (pseudo-)scalar target, in the recently developed framework based on the conformal operator-product expansion. This allows us to compute the complete set of helicity amplitudes of the process, in particular those that vanish at leading twist. We compare the effects of higher twist contributions to TCS with those in deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). Our estimates, based on a $\pi$-meson GPD model, indicate that these contributions are sizeable and will play a crucial role in the interpretation of data from current and forthcoming experiments.</description>

Abstract: We report a novel neutron interferometry scheme aimed at probing the potential existence of mirror neutrons, which have been proposed as viable dark matter candidates. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that if mirror neutrons exist, ordinary neutrons would acquire a measurable geometric phase as a result of their mixing with these mirror counterparts.</description>

      <title>Constraints on 1-0 texture through neutrino phenomenology and dark matter in minimal inverse seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we have realized texture zero structures of neutrino mass matrix through our study of neutrino phenomenology and dark matter. For analysing these processes, we have constructed a model in minimal inverse seesaw, ISS(2,3) by using $A_4$ discrete symmetry. The particle content of ISS(2.3) has been augmented by a scalar triplet $\eta=(\eta_1,\eta_2,\eta_3)$. The probable dark matter candidates for this model are the neutral components of $\eta$. The three mass matices of ISS(2,3), $M_D$, $M_{NS}$ and $M_S$ contribute to the structure of light neutrino mass matrix $m_\nu$. Here we try to examine the impact on texture structures of $m_\nu$ due to different possible 2-0 structures of $M_D$. To examine further possible contraints, we have evaluated the neutrino parameters and calculated relic density of dark matter for the favourable cases. From our analysis we find that out of the fifteen possible 2-0 structures, only two of them ($M_{D3}$ and $M_{D6}$) successfully generates all the mixing angles in the allowed ranges.</description>

      <title>Testing Lepton Flavor Universality at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of $b\to c\tau^-\bar\nu_\tau$ transitions at colliders are highly motivated for testing lepton flavor universality (LFU), a cornerstone hypothesis of the Standard Model (SM). Potential observations of LFU violation could provide significant evidence for physics beyond the SM (BSM). The substantial production of $b$-hadrons at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) would highlight its potential to support LFU testing and complement studies conducted at other experimental facilities. In this paper, we study the production of $b$-hadrons in deep inelastic scattering processes at the EIC with $\sqrt{s}=100\,\rm GeV$. We estimate the $b$-hadron yields at the EIC to reach $\mathcal O(10^9)$ with an integrated luminosity of up to $10^3\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$. Furthermore, we perform a systematic study on various $b$-hadron decays, exploring the sensitivities of LFU-violating observables, including $R_{J/\psi}$, $R_{D_s^{(\ast)}}$ and $R_{\Lambda_c}$. Detailed strategies for track-based event reconstruction are investigated for these observables. We also include a discussion of the annihilation process $B_c^+ \to \tau^+\nu_\tau$. Finally, we provide a theoretical interpretation of the projected sensitivities within the framework of low energy effective field theory (LEFT). Our analysis indicates that the EIC has the potential to constrain the relevant Wilson coefficients at $\mathcal O(0.1)$, offering complementary insights to other measurements.</description>

      <title>WIMP-FIMP option and neutrino masses via a novel anomaly-free B-L symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel $U(1)_{B-L}$ model with singlet dark matter fermions composed of WIMP and FIMP, which is anomaly-free without a need for introducing right-handed neutrinos. Fermion dark matter masses are generated after the $U(1)_{B-L}$ is broken spontaneously, so the Yukawa couplings for WIMP and FIMP components can be distinguished by the hierarchical values of the vacuum expectation values of the single scalar fields. Moreover, the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson receives a TeV-scale mass for a tiny extra gauge coupling, so it goes out of equilibrium from the rest of the model content in the early Universe. Both the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson and FIMP component are produced from the decays of the bath particles, and the former can decay into FIMP DM and/or WIMP DM before BBN. The WIMP component can reside in the resonance region of the Higgs bosons or dominantly annihilate into a pair of singlet-like scalars. Thus, there is a flexibility to choose a small mixing between the visible and dark sectors, thereby evading all the current direct and indirect detection bounds. Furthermore, we show that WIMP and FIMP components can coexist in suitable fractions, depending on the choice of model parameters, allowing for additional protection for WIMP DM against various experimental bounds. Finally, we identify the dimension-6 and dimension-7 operators for Majorana neutrino masses in our model, being consistent with the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry, and provide a possibility of extending the model with additional singlet fermions for neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Tripletino-like WIMP Dark Matter in the Supersymmetric Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Supersymmetric Custodial Triplet Model (SCTM), a Supersymmetric generalization of the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, is constructed by extending the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by three triplet chiral Superfields with hypercharge $Y=0,\pm 1$, in order to maintain the holomorphy of the Superpotential and satisfy the requirements of anomaly cancellation. The global $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetry has to be respected for the Superpotential and soft Supersymmetry breaking sector, where the former will only be broken by the Yukawa couplings and the latter one will be broken spontaneously to the custodial $SU(2)_V$ symmetry after Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking similar as the GM model. The ensuing complicated spectrum not only gives rich collider phenomenology but also provides more available Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) Dark Matter (DM) candidates. In this paper, we explore the viability of WIMP solutions for DM in the SCTM, by considering the increasingly stringent constraints from direct detection DM experiments. Our numerical simulations show that a significant portion of the SCTM parameter space remains viable despite these constraints and will be fully tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>The Electron-Ion Collider as A Prospective Facility for Pentaquark Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider provides a groundbreaking opportunity to study heavy pentaquarks with unprecedented precision, leveraging its high collision energy and beam spin polarization capabilities. As a representative case, we analyze electroproduction cross sections of Pc (4312) under different spin-parity hypotheses using the vector meson dominance model. To ensure a parameter-free approach and minimize ambiguity, we incorporate results from the LHCb and GlueX experiments. To characterize the spin and the parity of Pc (4312), we propose measuring the beam spin asymmetry and decay kinematic polarization, quantities that can be accurately determined by the ePIC detector. Our approach can be extended to investigate other heavy pentaquarks produced in electron-proton and electron-deuteron collisions, as well as to study their interactions with nuclear matter in electron-heavy ion collisions. We strongly encourage the EIC community to explore this potential and integrate pentaquark studies as a critical element of the scientific mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical effects on strangeness and light nuclei production in high energy collisions are investigated, with a particular focus on low multiplicity events observed in small collision systems at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and also in low energy collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We analyzed the yields of various particles, such as pions, protons, lambdas, multi-strange hadrons and light nuclei, and their dependencies on the produced charged particle multiplicities using the Statistical Hadronization Model (SHM). Our findings indicate that the canonical treatment of strange and baryon quantum numbers are essential for describing the particle production in these collisions, particularly in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Interference Effects on Higgs-boson Searches in the Di-top Final State at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The di-top final state is an important search channel for additional Higgs bosons at the LHC. In this channel, large signal--background interference contributions can strongly distort a resonance peak as it would be expected from a pure signal contribution. Moreover, signal--signal interference effects can have a significant impact if more than one additional scalar particle is present. In this work, we perform a comprehensive model-independent analysis of the various interference contributions considering two additional heavy scalars that can mix with each other. We point out the importance of taking into account loop-level mixing between the scalars. A proper treatment of these mixing effects, which has not been previously carried out for the di-top final state, introduces additional relative phases between different parts of the amplitudes entering the interference contributions which we find to have a strong impact on the di-top invariant mass distribution. We study the interference effects both in an idealistic setting as well as taking into account experimental limitations using Monte-Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that the emerging experimental signatures can be unexpected and difficult to interpret. In particular, we point out that an experimental signature manifesting itself as an excess near the $t \bar t$ threshold may actually be caused by new scalar particles with much higher masses. We comment in this context on the recent excess that has been observed by the CMS collaboration near the $t \bar t$ threshold in their searches in the di-top final state.</description>

      <title>Precision phenomenology of the PDF-BSM interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) is one of the most successful theories ever conceived, representing a triumph of human intellect and collaboration. The SM provides a very good description of visible matter, with the proton being a central part of this understanding. The structure of the proton can be parametrised in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), essential inputs for theoretical predictions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which cannot be computed from first principles and must be obtained from fits to experimental data.
  Despite the remarkable success of the SM, many fundamental questions remain unanswered, motivating the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). These searches often rely on precise comparisons between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. However, a significant challenge arises because PDFs are typically determined under SM assumptions. This approach can introduce potential biases and inconsistencies in BSM searches. Additionally, signals of BSM physics may be absorbed by the PDFs during the fitting procedure, further complicating the interpretation of the results.
  This PhD thesis explores the interplay between PDFs and BSM physics. We introduce the open-source release of SIMUnet, a deep learning framework designed to perform simultaneous fits of PDFs and BSM parameters, as well as to assess the potential absorption of BSM signals by the PDFs. We study the PDF-BSM interplay in the top sector and in a global dataset, and assess the absorption of BSM physics in widely used models. Additionally, we explore how BSM effects can alter the evolution of PDFs, and demonstrate the potential of interpretable machine learning techniques in symbolic regression for collider physics in general.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave cosmology in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) gravity, we systematically study gravitational waves (GWs), first produced by remote compact astrophysical sources and then propagating through the flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe at cosmic distances before arriving at detectors. Assuming that the speed $c_T$ of the spin-2 graviton is the same as that of photons, we find explicitly the stability conditions of the theory and then obtain the severest observational constraint found so far. In particular, all these conditions and constraints are satisfied, provided that $0 \leq \alpha\dot{f}(\phi_0) \lesssim 8.97 \times 10^{-24}$ (km), where $\alpha{f}(\phi)$ denotes the coupling strength between the scalar field $\phi$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term, an over-dot represents the derivative with respect to the cosmic time, and $\phi_0$ is the present value of $\phi$. The trajectories for both spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons and the amplitudes of GWs along the trajectories are explicitly obtained. The amplitude of a spin-2 GW is practically indistinguishable from that of GR, while the spin-0 GWs remain almost constant during radiation- and matter-dominated epochs, and in the dark energy-dominated epoch it is proportional to the physical distance between the source and the observer. A careful analysis shows that the latter is due to the assumption $c_T = 1$. When $c_T \not= 1$ to the extent that is consistent with the stability conditions and observational constraints, the above behavior disappears.</description>

      <title>Cuscuton Bounce Beyond the Linear Regime: Bispectrum and Strong Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cuscuton Gravity is characterized as a scalar field that can be added to general relativity without introducing any new dynamical degrees of freedom on a cosmological background. Yet, it modifies gravity such that spacetime singularities can be avoided. This has led to the Cuscuton bounce, a nonsingular cosmology that has been shown to be linearly stable, which is a rare feat. Upon introducing mechanisms known to generate a near-scale-invariant power spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in the prebounce contracting phase, we perform an extensive linear analysis of all scalar perturbations as they evolve through the Cuscuton bounce, both analytically and numerically. Then, after deriving the third-order perturbed action for our theory, we compare the magnitude of its terms (on shell) to those in the second-order action. We show that perturbativity is maintained in the infrared throughout the evolution, including through the bounce. In the ultraviolet, we show that a hierarchy of scales is maintained, with the strong coupling scale well above the relevant background energy scale at all times. We reconfirm these results by computing the three-point functions in various limits and demonstrate that the models do not have any strong coupling problems and furthermore that there is negligible non-Gaussianities on observable scales. Consequently, the primary potential source of observable non-Gaussianities may only arise from the conversion of isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations. The whole scenario is thus a robust, stable, weakly coupled nonsingular cosmological model, consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</description>

      <title>Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Supercooled Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions (1stOPTs) are said to be strongly supercooled when the nucleation temperature is much smaller than the critical temperature. These are often encountered in theories that admit a nearly scale-invariant potential, for which the bounce action decreases only logarithmically with temperature. During supercooled 1stOPTs the equation of state of the universe undergoes a rapid and drastic change, transitioning from vacuum-domination to radiation-domination. The statistical variations in bubble nucleation histories imply that distinct causal patches percolate at slightly different times. Patches which percolate the latest undergo the longest vacuum-domination stage and as a consequence develop large over-densities triggering their collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs). We derive an analytical approximation for the probability of a patch to collapse into a PBH as a function of the 1stOPT duration, $\beta^{-1}$, and deduce the expected PBH abundance. We find that 1stOPTs which take more than $15\%$ of a Hubble time to complete ($\beta/H \lesssim 7$) produce observable PBHs. Their abundance is independent of the duration of the supercooling phase, in agreement with the de Sitter no hair conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the interaction of leading jet partons within a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) medium, using the effective dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM). The DQPM offers a description of the sQGP's non-perturbative nature at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ through a propagator representation of massive off-shell partons (quarks and gluons). These partons are characterized by spectral functions with $T,\mu_B$ dependent masses and widths, adjusted to reproduce the lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (lQCD) equation-of-state (EoS) for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. Our focus lies on examining the jet transport coefficients by elastic scattering in sQGP, specifically the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit length denoted as $\hat{q}$, within the QGP. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of these coefficients on both the medium temperature $T$ and the jet parton energy. By studying the jet transport coefficients and their relationship to temperature and parton energy, we aim to gain insights into the dynamics of jet propagation in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma medium.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Conformal Higgs</title>

Abstract: Scale-invariant extensions of the electroweak theory are not only attractive because they can dynamically generate the weak scale, but also due to their role in facilitating supercooled first-order phase transitions. We study the minimal scale-invariant $U(1)_{\rm D}$ extension of the standard model and show that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can be abundantly produced. The mass of these PBHs is bounded from above by that of the moon due to QCD catalysis limiting the amount of supercooling. Lunar-mass PBHs, which are produced for dark Higgs vev $v_\phi\simeq 20~\rm TeV$, correspond to the best likelihood to explain the HSC lensing anomaly. For $v_\phi\gtrsim 400~\rm TeV$, the model can explain hundred per cent of dark matter. At even larger hierarchy of scales, it can contribute to the $511~\rm keV$ line. While the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by the HSC anomaly interpretation is large and detectable by LISA above astrophysical foreground, the dark matter interpretation in terms of PBHs can not be entirely probed by future GW detection. This is due to the dilution of the signal by the entropy injected during the decay of the long-lived $U(1)_{\rm D}$ scalar. This extended lifetime is a natural consequence of the large hierarchy of scales.</description>

Abstract: Basing on Mellin-Barnes representations and Miller's transformation, we present the Gel'fand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) hypergeometric systems of 4-loop vacuum Feynman integrals with arbitrary masses. Through the GKZ hypergeometric systems, the analytical hypergeometric solutions of 4-loop vacuum Feynman integrals with arbitrary masses can be obtained in neighborhoods of origin including infinity. The analytical expressions of Feynman integrals can be formulated as a linear combination of the fundamental solution systems in certain convergent region, which the combination coefficients can be determined by the integral at some regular singularities, the Mellin-Barnes representation of the integral, or some mathematical methods.</description>

      <title>Influence of the chiral magnetic effect on particle-pair elliptic anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive, azimuthal correlator difference $\Delta\gamma$ between opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) charged hadron pairs is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle elliptic anisotropy ($v_2$). The CME signal, on the other hand, contributes to the difference in the pair elliptic anisotropies between OS and SS pairs ($\Delta v_{2,\rm pair}$). We investigate $\Delta v_{2,\rm pair}$ and found its sensitivity to CME to be similar to that of the $\Delta\gamma$ observable.</description>

Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between strong azimuthal correlations, known as alignment, in families of hadrons and photons observed in cosmic ray experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. The results show that the high degree of alignment can appear in nucleus-nucleus interactions at reasonable values of the transverse momentum disbalance of most energetic detected particles.</description>

      <title>Gluon Sivers function from forward exclusive $\chi_{c1}$ photoproduction on unpolarized protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exclusive production of a $\chi_{c1}$ axial vector quarkonia in photon-proton scattering at high energies requires a $C$-odd $t$-channel exchange. In the limit of vanishing momentum transfer this occurs either via the exchange of a photon, the Primakoff process, where the spin of the proton does not change. For axial-vector meson production, as a consequence of the Landau-Yang theorem, the Primakoff cross section is finite as $t \to 0$. Alternatively, a $C$-odd spin dependent Odderon can be exchanged, which involves a spin flip of the proton. The resulting cross section is related to the square of the collinear trigluon correlator or the $k_\perp$-moment of the gluon Sivers function. Using two models for the gluon Sivers function from the literature we compute the ratio of Sivers to Primakoff cross sections and the angular coefficient $\lambda_\theta$ governing the angular distribution of the $\chi_{c1} \to J/\psi + \gamma$ decay as functions of $x$. We point out that these observables constrain the magnitude of the gluon Sivers function at small $x$ which could be accessed in electron-proton scattering and ultraperipheral proton-proton and nucleus-proton collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leptoquarks (LQs) can contribute to the magnetic and electric dipole moments of charged leptons, which the current experiments have measured with good accuracy. We revisit the parameter spaces of TeV-scale vector LQs that contribute to these observables and study how these models fare against the LHC bounds. We show that significant portions of the parameter space are excluded when the current LHC data is utilised effectively. We find that only $U_1$ and $V_2$ can explain the observed positive shift in $(a_\mu^{\rm exp} - a_\mu^{\rm SM})$ through a lepton chirality-flipping contribution with $\mathcal O(1)$ LQ-quark-lepton coupling. We also see how these two LQs can fit the electron dipole moment and atomic parity violation measurements. We find that the current electric dipole moment measurements of the muon cannot restrain the LQ-quark-lepton couplings within perturbative regions.</description>

      <title>Fast multilabel classification of HEP constraints with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shortcomings of the Standard Model (SM) motivate its extension to accommodate new expected phenomena, such as dark matter and neutrino masses. However, such extensions are generally more complex due to the presence of a large number of free parameters and additional phenomenology. Understanding how theoretical and experimental limits affect the parameter spaces of new models, individually and collectively, is of utmost importance for conducting model status analysis, motivating precise computations, or model-building aimed at solving certain issues. However, checking the constraints usually require a large amount of time using a chain of physics tools. We demonstrate, for the first time, the application of deep learning (DL) for the multilabel classification (MLC) of a group of theoretical and experimental constraints in the dark doublet phase of the next-to-two-Higgs-doublet model (DDP-N2HDM), as a representative 9-dimensional parameter space. We analyze the issue of class imbalance and the ability of the classifier to learn joint class distributions. We demonstrate the time advantage compared to physics tools, with the classifier achieving orders of magnitude faster checks on groups of constraints and strong performance. The classifier performed strongly in terms of identifying regions where all constraints are valid or invalid, as well as regions where one or more of the constraints are valid or invalid simultaneously. This approach can be applied to any extension beyond the SM with the potential to aid HEP tools or act as a surrogate for fast model status checks. To that end, we provide a python tool \texttt{HEPMLC} for generating and investigating multilabel classifiers for SM extensions.</description>

      <title>More is Different: Multi-Axion Dynamics Changes Topological Defect Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study topological defects in multi-axion models arising from multiple Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalars. Using a simplified two-axion system, we reveal fundamental differences in the evolution of these defects compared to single-axion scenarios. This finding is particularly significant because, despite the fact that integrating out heavier axions reduces these models to an effective single PQ scalar theory at low energies, the actual physical behavior of topological defects differs markedly from single-axion predictions. Unlike single-axion models where conventional cosmic strings form, multi-axion scenarios with post-inflationary or mixed initial conditions generically produce networks of strings interconnected by high-tension domain walls. This results in a severe cosmological domain wall problem. We determine string-wall network instability conditions and discuss cosmological implications including the application to the QCD axion and gravitational wave generation. Our findings highlight that multi-axion dynamics can lead to qualitatively different outcomes for topological defects, challenging the conventional picture of cosmic evolution of topological defects based on single-axion models.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the influence of \(\kappa\) Minkowski-type quantum spacetime on neutrino oscillations, revealing that spacetime fluctuations introduce a unique energy-dependent power law, \(E^{-4}\), in the decoherence effect for relic neutrinos. This effect is particularly pronounced for low-energy neutrinos, such as those from the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results indicate the potential for new models of low-energy quantum gravity-induced decoherence, which could pave the way for future experiments, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, to further constrain the deformation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a beyond Standard Model (SM) featuring five new fields. Four fields encompassing three distinct spin states - scalar ($ S $), spinor ($ \psi^{1,2} $), and vector ($ V_{\mu} $) - together form the multi-component dark matter (DM), while the fifth (scalar) field ($ \phi $) carries a unit charge under a dark $ U_{D}(1) $ gauge symmetry, enabling SM-DM interactions via the Higgs portal. Although the model maintains classical scale invariance, loop effects break electroweak symmetry. The parameter space is constrained by scale invariance, DM relic density, and direct detection results. Our study aims to identify feasible model regions and evaluate detectability in future experiments. We analyze processes like DM annihilations, semi-annihilations, and conversions, integrating them into Boltzmann equations to calculate DM abundances. Random parameter scans reveal regions compatible with current data, including constraints from direct detection experiments like XENONnT and PandaX-4T . Our results show the model's viability across a broad range of DM masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the precise measurement of the largest leptonic mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ through the analysis of neutrino oscillation data samples. Our findings indicate that, contrary to common understanding, the ${\nu}_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow {\nu}_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e})$ appearance samples, rather than the ${\nu}_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow \nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})$ disappearance samples, are sensitive to test the hypothesis of maximal mixing $\theta_{23}=\pi/4$, particularly if $\theta_{23}$ resides in the higher octant and $\sin^2\theta_{23}&lt;0.54$. The former serves as the primary source for determining the octant of the $\theta_{23}$ mixing angle; however, the latter remains relevant if $\theta_{23}$ is indeed in the lower octant with $\sin^2\theta_{23}&lt;0.42$. In a joint T2HK and DUNE analysis, utilizing only appearance sub-samples can exclude the maximal-mixing and determine the actual octant for about 60\% of the currently allowed range of the $\theta_{23}$ angle. We argue that, despite the presence of parameter degeneracy, the precise measurement of $\theta_{23}$ exhibits minimal dependence on other unknown factors, including the CP-violation phase and neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of supersymmetric models where the strong CP problem is solved through spontaneous CP violation, carried out by a complex scalar field that determines the Yukawa couplings of the theory. Assuming that one real component of this field - the CPon - is light, we examine the conditions under which it provides a viable Dark Matter candidate. The CPon couplings to fermions are largely determined by the field-dependent Yukawa interactions, and induce couplings to gauge bosons at 1-loop. All couplings are suppressed by an undetermined UV scale, which needs to exceed $10^{12}$ GeV in order to satisfy constraints on excessive stellar cooling and rare kaon decays. The CPon mass is limited from below by 5th force experiments and from above by X-ray telescopes looking for CPon decays to photons, leaving a range roughly between 10 meV and 1 MeV. Everywhere in the allowed parameter space the CPon can saturate the observed Dark Matter abundance through an appropriate balance of misalignment and freeze-in production from heavy SM fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between quark-antiquark pairs is essential for elucidating quark confinement within the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the field distribution patterns that arise between these pairs by employing advanced machine learning techniques, namely multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN), to analyze data obtained from lattice QCD simulations. The models developed through this training are then applied to calculate the string tension and width associated with chromo flux tubes, and these results are rigorously compared to those derived from lattice QCD. Moreover, we introduce a preliminary analytical expression that characterizes the field distribution as a function of quark separation, utilizing the KAN methodology. Our comprehensive quantitative analysis underscores the potential of integrating machine learning approaches into conventional QCD research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the production of charmonium $2P$ states via the $e^+e^-\to \gamma D\bar{D}$ process at $\sqrt{s} = 4.23$ GeV. Using the measured cross-section data for $e^+e^-\to \gamma X(3872)$ as a reference, we calculate the cross sections for $e^+e^-\to \gamma \chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $e^+e^-\to \gamma \chi_{c2}(2P)$. Since the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ states predominantly decay into $D\bar{D}$ final states, we also predict the corresponding $D\bar{D}$ invariant mass spectrum for the $e^+e^-\to \gamma D\bar{D}$ process. Our results indicate that $e^+e^-\to \gamma D\bar{D}$ is an ideal process for identifying the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ states, analogous to the $\gamma\gamma\to D\bar{D}$ and $B^+\to D^+D^-K^+$ processes. This study highlights the discovery potential of charmonium $2P$ states at BESIII and Belle II.</description>

      <title>Five dimensional $SU(5) \times U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a grand unified model in five dimensions that addresses the strong CP problem. In this framework, the boundary conditions that break the unified gauge group into the Standard Model gauge group simultaneously explain the mass splitting of the new matter content required for gauge coupling unification and the emergence of the QCD axion as the $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ gauge field. The quality of the axion solution is inherently ensured by the gauge symmetry of the model. We further investigate the implications of this setup, including its predictions for the proton decay rate, the detectability of axion dark matter, and its cosmological impact. Notably, the model predicts a proton decay signal within the sensitivity of upcoming experiments, a result driven by the trade-off between the unification scale and the reheating temperature. In our scenario, the scales of grand unification and the axion decay constant are naturally unified.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV, making the test of neutrino seesaw a great challenge. A striking fact is that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. Through the neutrino seesaw mechanism, fluctuations of the Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays, contributing to the curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrino seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Signatures of Neutrino Seesaw Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this work, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos. After inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field which act as the source of curvature perturbations. We demonstrate that this modulation produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures, which can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Exploring jet transport coefficients by elastic scattering in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of leading jet partons in a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) medium based on the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM). The DQPM describes the non-perturbative nature of the sQGP at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ based on a propagator representation of massive off-shell partons (quarks and gluons) whose properties (characterized by spectral functions with $T,\mu_B$ dependent masses and widths) are adjusted to reproduce the lQCD EoS for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. We present the results for the jet transport coefficients, i.e. the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit length $\hat{q}$ as well as the energy loss per unit length $\Delta E =dE/dx$, in the QGP and investigate their dependence on the temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ as well as on jet properties such as the leading jet parton momentum, mass, flavor, and the choice of the strong coupling constant. In this first study only elastic scattering processes of a leading jet parton with the sQGP partons are explored discarding presently the radiative processes (such as gluon Bremsstrahlung). We present a comparison of our results for the elastic energy loss in the sQGP medium with the pQCD results obtained by the BAMPS and LBT models as well as with other theoretical approaches such as lattice QCD and the LO-HTL and also with estimates of $\hat{q}/T^3$ by the color string percolation model (CSPM) and the JET and JETSCAPE Collaborations based on a comparison of hydrodynamical calculations with experimental heavy-ion data.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the effect of the population model uncertainty on the strong lensing Bayes factor using nonparametric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong lensing of gravitational waves can produce several detectable images as repeated events in the upcoming observing runs, which can be detected with the posterior overlap analysis (Bayes factor). The choice of the binary black hole population plays an important role in the analysis as two gravitational-wave events could be similar either because of lensing or astrophysical coincidence. In this study, we investigate the biases induced by different population models on the Bayes factor. We build up a mock catalog of gravitational-wave events following a benchmark population and reconstruct it using both nonparametric and parametric methods. Using these reconstructions, we compute the Bayes factor for lensed pair events by utilizing both models and compare the results with a benchmark model. We show that the use of a nonparametric population model gives a smaller bias than parametric population models. Therefore, our study demonstrates the importance of choosing a sufficiently agnostic population model for strong lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely established that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>Every Poincar\'e gauge theory is conformal: a compelling case for dynamical vector torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT) of gravity provides a viable formulation of general relativity (Einstein-Cartan theory), and a popular model-building framework for modified gravity with torsion. Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.</description>

      <title>Quantum integration of decay rates at second order in perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first quantum computation of a total decay rate in high-energy physics at second order in perturbative quantum field theory. This work underscores the confluence of two recent cutting-edge advances. On the one hand, the quantum integration algorithm Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which efficiently decomposes the target function into its Fourier series through a quantum neural network before quantumly integrating the corresponding Fourier components. On the other hand, causal unitary in the loop-tree duality (LTD), which exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in LTD to coherently generate all contributions with different numbers of final-state particles to a scattering or decay process, leading to singularity-free integrands that are well suited for Fourier decomposition. We test the performance of the quantum algorithm with benchmark decay rates in a quantum simulator and in quantum hardware, and find accurate theoretical predictions in both settings.</description>

      <title>Meson spectroscopy in the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory with three antisymmetric fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the results of an extensive numerical study of the $Sp(4)$ lattice gauge theory with three (Dirac) flavors of fermion in the two-index antisymmetric representation. In the presence of (degenerate) fermion masses, the theory has an enhanced global $SU(6)$ symmetry, broken explicitly and spontaneously to its $SO(6)$ subgroup. This symmetry breaking pattern makes the theory interesting for applications in the context of composite Higgs models, as well as for the implementation of top partial compositeness. It can also provide a dynamical realisation of the strongly interacting massive particle paradigm for the origin of dark matter. We adopt the standard plaquette gauge action with the Wilson-Dirac formulation for the fermions and apply the (rational) hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in our ensemble generation process. We monitor the autocorrelation and topology of the ensembles. We explore the bare parameter space, and identify the weak and strong coupling regimes separated by a line of first-order bulk phase transitions.
  We measure two-point correlation functions between meson operators that transform as non-trivial representations of $SO(6)$, and extract the ground-state masses and the decay constants, in all accessible spin and parity channels. In addition, we measure the mass of the first excited state for the vector meson by solving a generalised eigenvalue problem. Spectral quantities show a mass dependence that is compatible with the expectation that, at long distances, the theory undergoes confinement, accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of the approximate global symmetries acting on the matter fields. Finally, we discuss the continuum and massless extrapolations, after setting the physical scale using the gradient flow method, and compare the results to those of existing studies in the quenched approximation, as well as to the literature on closely related theories.</description>

      <title>Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and the K-identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models with phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. We show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as ~10^51 erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Our results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, we predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. We find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.</description>
