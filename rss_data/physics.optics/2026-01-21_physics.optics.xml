      <title>Gouy phase-assisted Zeno effect for protecting light structure in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying physical mechanisms that protect the information carried by various forms of structured light is one of the cornerstones of today's classical and quantum communications. Here we show that the purity of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes can be protected against degradation in random media by leveraging two fundamental features of their own Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian dynamics, namely, Zeno effect -- frequent observations slow down the evolution -- , and Gouy phase -- the back-action of the observation. Repeated, OAM-dependent Gouy phase kicks imparted along the disturbing path by simple imaging systems trigger the optical Zeno effect that protects the input OAM mode against mode cross-talk that would broaden the OAM spectrum. Given the universality of the mechanism, the Gouy phase-assisted Zeno effect would protect propagation modes other than those of OAM, and the diverse forms of structured light built with them.</description>

      <title>Ultra-broadband Mid to Long-wave Infrared Spintronic Poisson Bolometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared detectors have traditionally been divided into two fundamental classes, mid-wave (MWIR, 3-5 um) and long-wave (LWIR, 8-14 um). Integrating MWIR and LWIR within a single device is challenging due to distinct materials, cooling needs, and detection mechanisms, while such integration is critical for improved object recognition, temperature estimation, and environmental sensing. In this work, we demonstrate a Spintronic Poisson (SP) bolometer enabling room-temperature ultra-broadband sensing across 3-14 um. Unlike conventional bolometers that rely on continuous analog signals, the SP bolometer implements a Poisson-counting detection paradigm, encoding temperature in discrete stochastic events, which turns thermal noise from a limitation into the basis of the estimator itself. We fabricate the SP bolometer using a spintronic transduction layer integrated with a plasmonic nanoantenna array to enhance broadband infrared absorption. Using spintronic transduction, the device achieves the noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD, thermal sensitivity metric) of 80-100 mK at 300 K, surpassing uncooled detectors and approaching cooled technologies. This work establishes a statistical detection paradigm for room-temperature infrared sensing with broad application potential.</description>

      <title>A 25 THz bandwidth THz spectroscopy system exploiting BNA crystals and a tunable single-ring-fiber pulse compressor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system which accesses a broadband spectrum, efficiently covering the so-called "new THz gap" between 5 and 15 THz and extending beyond 25 THz. The system exploits nonlinear interactions within the organic crystal BNA (N-benzyl-2-methyl-4-nitroaniline) to generate and detect THz radiation upon excitation by a near-infrared (NIR) pulse centered at 1.03 $\mu$m. To enable broadband THz spectral monitoring, the NIR pulse from a Yb-based solid-state laser undergoes spectral broadening in a gas-filled single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fiber, followed by a pulse compression to achieve durations as short as 31 fs. This approach paves the way for broadband spectroscopy in hard-to-access THz regions using widely available near-infrared ultrafast sources.</description>

      <title>A wafer-scale ultrasensitive programmable chiroptical sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiroptical enantioselective sensing is gaining traction across various applications. However, intrinsic molecular chiroptical responses are weak, and existing amplification approaches add synthesis, manufacturing, or operational complexity that limits sensitivity, scalability, and dynamic control. Here, we present a fundamentally new sensing paradigm merging adsorption-driven chirality induction with wafer-scale optical transduction in a programmable heterostructure containing twisted aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and phase change materials (PCMs). Chiral molecules adsorb onto CNTs to form chiroptically active composites that are macroscopically assembled by alignment and rotational stacking, yielding large ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD). We resolve molecule concentration and handedness in a single device without lithography, hotspot delivery, or differential protocols, achieving sub-$\mu$M sensitivity for CD-silent glucose and chiral amino acids enabled by $&gt;10^5\,\mathrm{M^{-1}}$ adsorption constants. We validate adsorption using molecular dynamics simulations, reproduce experimental results using chiral transfer matrix simulations, and realize sensor programmability by tuning the PCM layer. This platform enables cost-effective in-situ enantiomer monitoring in aqueous environments.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler rubidium atom cooling using a programmable agile integrated PZT-on-SiN resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmability and precise control of laser frequency are essential for quantum experiments and applications such as atomic clocks, quantum computers, and cold-atom sensors. Current systems use bulky, power-hungry modulators and frequency shifters which are difficult to integrate and limit portability and scalability. We report an electrically controllable, agile optical frequency source based on a semiconductor laser stabilized to a photonic-integrated, lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-actuated resonator cavity. We demonstrate this approach with precision programmable frequency control of a 780-nm laser that can periodically reference to rubidium spectroscopy followed by fast, programmable, arbitrary frequency tuning sequences for quantum control. We use this approach to demonstrate sub-Doppler cooling of rubidium-87 without any external modulators, achieving atom-cloud temperatures as low as 16 $\mu$K. The device achieves a tuning strength up to 1 GHz/V with 11 MHz modulation bandwidth while consuming only 10 nW of electrical power. This work establishes a route toward compact, low-power, and chip-scale laser systems for next-generation quantum and atomic sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Integrated nano electro-optomechanical spiking neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers a pathway toward energy-efficient processing of data, yet hardware platforms combining nanoscale integration and multimodal functionality remain scarce. Here we demonstrate a gallium-phosphide electro-optomechanical spiking neuron that integrates optical and electromechanical interfaces within a single nanostructure on a silicon photonic chip operating at telecommunication wavelengths (1550 nm) and exploiting a 3 gigahertz-frequency mechanical mode. Our device displays excitable dynamics, generating optical spikes at its output, as in the spiking activity of neurons and cardiac cells and defined by the calibrated all-or-none response to external perturbations. This dynamic is consistent with the saddle-node on invariant circle scenario and associated features are demonstrated including control of excitable threshold, temporal summation and refractory period. Our device compact footprint and its CMOS-compatible platform make it well suited for edge-computing applications requiring low latency and establish a foundation for versatile brain-inspired optomechanical computing and advanced on-chip optical pulse sources.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Bi-Cavity Nanostructure for Efficient Light Collection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) typically relies on high-NA excitation to generate a strong axial field at the tip apex, which shortens the working distance and constrains sample geometries. We show that a plasmonic bi-cavity tip, the plasmon-tunable tip pyramid (PTTP), co-tuned in nanopyramid length L and plateau length W, supports a hybrid antenna-cavity mode that funnels energy to the apex under radially polarized, on-axis excitation, even with a dry objective of NA = 0.75. Finite-element simulations identify W as a design-critical parameter that sets an in-plane surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) Fabry-P\'erot-like resonance; co-tuning (L,W) yields a periodic series of maximal apex |E|^2. Experiments on monolayer graphene confirm near-field enhancement and reproduce the characteristic annular TERS point spread function (PSF) with NA = 0.75. Relaxing the NA requirement increases working distance and compatibility with constrained environments, pointing to practical, deployment-ready nano-Raman instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Revealing the long-range coupling for multi-dimensional metasurface multiplexer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface coupling constitutes a fundamental yet intricate electromagnetic interaction that occurs within a lattice of artificial subwavelength unit cells. Despite its prevalence, such coupling is typically ignored in conventional metasurface design frameworks due to the high characterization complexity, leading to suboptimal device performance. Here, we reveal a distinctive long-range coupling that exceeds an order of magnitude compared with the interaction range of evanescent waves, substantially enriching the metasurface design landscapes. This coupling exhibits pronounced graph topological features, and we design a graph neural network (GNN) to accurately abstract its inherent physics. Through strategic enhancement of the coupling effects, the discrete metasurface responses are transformed into continuous states, thereby unlocking diverse multiplexing channels. By further integrating the GNN into an inverse design agent, we tailor the multi-channel global response of metasurface to support simultaneous multiplexing across angle, frequency, and polarization domains. Experimentally, we demonstrate a compact metasurface multiplexer with eight independent channels, showcasing its potential for next-generation vehicular networks. This work establishes a new paradigm for highly integrated multifunctional metasurfaces, with promising prospects for high-density optical storage, information encryption, and high-capacity wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Broadband silicon polarization beam splitter based on Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broadband silicon polarization beam splitter (PBS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on Floquet-engineered directional couplers. The total length of the coupling structure is 20 um . By periodically modulating the waveguide width of the directional couplers, the power exchange between the two waveguides for the transverse-electric (TE) mode is suppressed, whereas the power coupling for the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode is enhanced. The fabricated PBS exhibits polarization extinction ratios (PERs) &gt; 20 dB for both polarizations over a broad wavelength range of 1483 nm-1620 nm. Additionally, the measured insertion losses (ILs) are 0.15 dB and 1.2 dB at 1550 nm for TE and TM polarizations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Temporal Beam Self-Cleaning in Second-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial-temporal beam quality of laser sources is crucial for applications such as nonlinear spectroscopy and master oscillator power amplification systems. However, the temporal stability remains challenged by issues like line-width broadening and high-power demand in efforts to improve it. In this work, we investigate the effect of the second-harmonic generation process on the laser characteristics under three longitudinal mode regimes: single-longitudinal-mode, dual-longitudinal-mode, and multi-longitudinal-mode. The results demonstrate that the second-harmonic generation process effectively stabilizes the temporal characteristics of the laser and enhances its correlation, leading to a temporally clean output beam. The physical mechanism of the observed temporal stabilization effect can be attributed to a high-peak-pulse attenuation effect, jointly induced by nonuniform longitudinal-mode depletion and phase preservation in the residual fundamental wave. Statistical analysis indicates that at the maximum fundamental-wave power in the multi-longitudinal-mode regime, the standard deviation and peak-to-valley values derived from the normalized temporal profile decrease from 0.6122 and 5.6846 for the fundamental wave to 0.189 and 0.8847 for the residual fundamental wave. Meanwhile, the background level of the intensity auto-correlation function rises from ~0.72 to ~0.96, revealing its evolution toward a more coherent state. To the best of our knowledge, this research presents the first demonstration of laser temporal stabilization and correlation enhancement via second-harmonic generation. It not only deepens the comprehension of second-harmonic generation mechanisms, but also opens up a new avenue for realizing temporal beam self-cleaning of light.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional video imaging via generative deep learning and a diffuser-encoded image sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light carries rich information across space, spectrum, polarization, and time, yet conventional cameras capture only a narrow projection of this multidimensional structure. A thin diffuser encodes wavelength-dependent information into single-shot scatterograms, captured by a polarization-resolving CMOS sensor that simultaneously measures four linear polarization states. We use 4DCam to image a live Betta splendens fish, uncovering polarization-dependent color modulations that remain invisible to conventional cameras. We experimentally show that the 4D information encoded in the scatterograms markedly improves material discrimination, achieving 96% accuracy for textile classification and 90% for camouflage detection, compared with 70% and 80%, respectively, using 3D hyperspectral imaging alone. Built entirely from passive optics, 4DCam seamlessly integrates physical encoding, generative decoding, and direct inference, enabling real-time, information-complete optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Bio-Inspired Photonic Spectral Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact spectrometers promise to revolutionize sensing applications, offering a unique pathway to laboratory-grade analysis within a miniaturized footprint. Central to their performance is the encoding strategy to unknown spectra, which determines the efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability of spectral reconstruction. However, the absence of a unified spectral encoding framework has hindered the realization of optimal, high-performance compact spectrometers. We propose a transformative approach: an information-theoretic framework grounded in bio-inspired Bayesian expected information gain that defines the first generic light encoder for computational spectrometers. By optimizing three fundamental attributes at the lowest level of physical hierarchy, (1) orthogonality, (2) completeness, and (3) sparsity, we establish a design paradigm that transcends conventional encoding hardware limitations. We validate this paradigm with the first generic encoder capable of dynamically reconfiguring its response matrices. Experiments show superior reconstruction fidelity across diverse spectral regimes, enabling tunable spectral encoding tailored to varied input features. An ultra-high resolution of 6 pm and a broad measurable bandwidth of 30 nm are experimentally validated. By bridging the gap between theoretical encoding principles and reconfigurable hardware, our framework defines a coherent basis for future advances in compact spectrometry.</description>

      <title>Optical Self-Trapping and Nonlinear Light-Matter Interactions in Biological Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-scattering, deep-penetration light transport in biological media remains a pivotal challenge for biophotonic technologies, including biomedical imaging, optical diagnostics, and photodynamic therapy. This review builds upon and extends our earlier studies of nonlinear optical self-trapping and optically induced waveguiding in biological suspensions, such as human erythrocytes and cyanobacteria, where light-matter coupling is governed by optical-force-mediated particle redistribution. Recent progress has revealed increasingly rich and complex regimes, including the propagation and nonlinear self-action of structured (vortex) beams in biological environments, as well as nonlinear responses dominated by thermally driven mechanisms in absorptive biomolecular solutions (e.g., heme and chlorophyll). We place particular emphasis on distinctive nonlinear phenomena observed in these systems, including spatial self-phase modulation, optical-force-induced sculpturing of effective energy landscapes, and quasi-waveguide formation in soft, heterogeneous biological media. We conclude by highlighting emerging opportunities to harness these nonlinear behaviors for deep-tissue imaging, label-free biosensing, and the realization of biocompatible photonic structures and devices assembled directly from living or hybrid biological matter.</description>

      <title>Bridging Photon Statistics and Phase Transitions in Random Fiber Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems exhibit rich equilibrium states, yet the universal principles governing these systems remain unrevealed, motivating the search for novel experimental platforms. Random fiber lasers (RFLs), which generate partially-coherent light-wave through feedback from Rayleigh scattering, provide a photonic realization of such systems. Here we report a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation of photon statistics for RFLs based on classical second-order temporal correlation function \( g^{(2)}(\tau) \), revealing unique statistical properties and introduce a two-dimensional framework for controlling photon statistics. Remarkably, we establish a unified landscape between photon correlation, intensity statistics governed by Levy statistics, and phase transitions with replica symmetry breaking. This multifaceted relationship, observed for the first time, bridges disordered photonics with statistical physics of complex system. Our results offer new pathways for engineering laser emission with controllable photon statistics, and more broadly, this work positions RFLs as a fertile land for exploring emergent behaviors in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Saturable absorption in NV-doped diamond studied by femtosecond Z-scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear optical absorption in diamond crystals containing high densities of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers using open-aperture Z-scan measurements with 230 fs laser pulses at 1032 nm, within the transparency window of diamond. While high-purity electronic-grade diamond exhibits third-order nonlinear absorption, NV-doped samples display pronounced saturable absorption that strengthens with increasing defect concentration. Linear transmission spectroscopy reveals that, in addition to NV centers, the crystals host significant populations of H2 (NVN-) defect complexes whose absorption band partially overlaps the excitation wavelength. By correlating spectroscopic data with nonlinear measurements and modeling the response using an effective two-level system, we show that the observed saturation cannot be attributed solely to NV centers but arises from the combined contribution of NV-related and H2 defects. For the highly doped sample, we determine an effective linear absorption coefficient of alpha0 = 6.52 cm-1 and a saturation intensity of Is = 40.0 GW/cm2. These findings highlight the critical role of the complex defect landscape in governing the nonlinear optical response of NV-doped diamond and underscore the necessity of accounting for ancillary defect species in the design of diamond-based nonlinear and quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Mixtenna: A Self-Biased Nonlinear Patch Antenna for Passive Third-Harmonic Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear rectangular patch antenna (RPA) is presented in which back-to-back Schottky diodes are embedded at high-field regions to enable passive, bias-free harmonic generation. The self-biased diodes introduce a power-dependent impedance that drives efficient frequency up-conversion and selective third-harmonic radiation. A tailored matching network enhances third-harmonic excitation and coupling while preserving radiation efficiency at the fundamental frequency. Analytical modeling combined with SPICE-assisted full-wave time-domain simulations predicts strong odd-harmonic content, and measurements on RPA prototypes employing SMS7630 diodes confirm these results. Simulated and measured S-parameters and far-field patterns at 925 MHz and 2.775 GHz show excellent agreement. The demonstrated approach establishes nonlinear loading as an effective mechanism for passive harmonic control in compact radiators, enabling frequency-agile and spectrum-efficient antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing van der Waals NbOI2 by SiO2 encapsulation for Photonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium oxide diiodide (NbOI2) is an emerging material for photonics and electronics, distinguished by its exceptional second-order nonlinearity and pronounced in-plane ferroelectricity, both originating from its highly anisotropic ABC-stacked crystal structure. Its broken inversion symmetry enables its optical nonlinear efficiency to scale with thickness, making multilayer NbOI2 highly promising for nonlinear frequency conversion like second harmonic generation or and spontaneous parametric down-conversion in bulk or waveguides. However, under ambient conditions NbOI2 degrades into an amorphous oxide within weeks, severely diminishing its nonlinear response. To overcome this, we investigate SiO2 encapsulation via physical vapor deposition to protect NbOI2 multilayers from environmental degradation. Our systematic study reveals that encapsulation preserves structural integrity and nonlinear optical performance, establishing NbOI2 as a stable candidate for heterogeneous integration in foundry-compatible photonic platforms and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Minimal-footprint photonic crystal nanolasers for biointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystals allow unprecedented control over how light is confined, propagates, and interacts with matter. Their development has had a transformative impact on optics and physics, and they remain the central platform for both fundamental discoveries and practical photonic technologies. However, the relatively large footprint and substrate-bound nature of photonic crystal structures have so far strongly limited their use as miniature optical devices or biointegrated sensors. Here, we overcome these limitations by identifying the minimal size of a 2D photonic crystal array needed to achieve lasing and describe the fabrication of substrate-less hexagonal laser particles with an active area as small as 30 {\mu}m2. Massively parallel fabrication, robust detachment, and integration of the nanolaser particles into live cells is demonstrated. Crucially, by engineering spatial and spectral mode characteristics, we designed NIR-II probes with mode volumes on the order of tens of attolitres, an order of magnitude smaller than whispering gallery probes of similar dimensions. Such high light localization is comparable in scale to different organelles of eucaryotic cells. In the future, we expect that chemical or plasmonic functionalization of the device will enable label-free sensing of nanoscale intracellular processes, and that it shall serve as a miniature platform to exploit developments in optical and quantum sensing for chemical and biological applications.</description>

      <title>Purely equatorial lasing in spherical liquid crystal polymer microlasers with engineered refractive index gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal whispering gallery mode microlasers show high sensitivity to external stimuli and distinct spectral features, rendering them ideally suited for various sensing applications. They also offer intrinsic anisotropic optical properties, which can be used to shape and manipulate light even inside spatially highly symmetric structures. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed optical characterization of a spherical bipolar liquid crystal polymer microlaser that tightly confines the optical path of whispering gallery modes to the equatorial plane. By controlled anchoring of the liquid crystal mesogens followed by polymerization, a fixed refractive index gradient is formed within the spherical microcavity. Consequently, only transverse electric (TE) modes oscillating in the equatorial plane experience the high extraordinary refractive index, allowing to confine lasing into a single plane. Furthermore, we observe that the refractive index gradient causes a characteristic splitting of the TE modes. By combining hyperspectral imaging and analytical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed splitting is caused by lifting of the energy degeneracy of higher order azimuthal laser modes, enabling direct insights into the complex interplay of refractive index gradients and resulting whispering gallery mode confinement. In addition, the unique ability to confine lasing of a spherical microbead into only a single plane makes these microlasers independent of the exact position of the pump beam, which allows consistent localized sensing especially in combination with fast point scanning microscopes or inside highly dynamic biological environments.</description>

      <title>An efficient numerical method for simulating two-dimensional non-periodic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are extremely useful for controlling and manipulating electromagnetic waves. Full-wave numerical simulation is highly desired for their design and optimization, but it is notoriously difficult, even for two-dimensional metasurfaces, when they comprise a huge number of subwavelength elements. This paper focuses on two-dimensional non-periodic metasurfaces that contain only a relatively small number of distinct subwavelength elements. We develop an efficient numerical method based on Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators, the finite element method and local function expansions. Our method drastically reduces the total number of unknowns and is capable of simulating two-dimensional metasurfaces with $10^{5}$ subwavelength elements on a personal computer. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method maintains high accuracy while offering significant advantages in both computational time and memory usage compared to the classical full-domain finite element method, making it particularly suited for the analysis of large metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Twisting harmonics: Transfer of orbital angular momentum in solid-state high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although solid-state platforms underpin modern electronics, little is known about how intense ultrashort light pulses carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) interact with solids. This gap persists even though, for more conventional light-matter interactions, the complex underlying electron dynamics can often be confined to a single Brillouin zone and described well within the dipole approximation. Previous studies were restricted to nonlinear, perturbative regimes, largely because the generation of intense ultrashort vortex pulses, particularly in the mid-infrared spectral regime, has remained a long-standing challenge. Consequently, the role of structured light in driving nonlinear, non-perturbative processes in solids, and the associated transfer of angular momentum during these interactions, has not been systematically explored. Here, we investigate solid-state high-harmonic generation (HHG) driven by intense ultrashort structured light using a versatile experimental approach applicable to different materials and geometries. We demonstrate that the OAM of the driving field is coherently transferred to the emitted harmonics. In particular, we show that the OAM is conserved independently of the crystal symmetry, the range of electronic interactions, and the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. These results establish OAM-resolved HHG as a robust framework for characterizing and controlling angular momentum transfer in solid-state HHG and open new avenues for structured-light-driven quantum technologies and topological materials investigations.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Second-Order Topological Phases and Bipolar Skin Effect in Photonic Kagome Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian photonics provides a fertile platform for exploring phenomena with no Hermitian counterparts, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, with direct relevance for integrated photonic technologies. In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory. Our findings establish a general framework for non-Hermitian higher-order photonic systems and open avenues toward tailorable topological photonic devices exploiting non-Hermitian enhanced localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser hardening of metals occurs under the influence of a shock wave, which changes the distribution and density of one-dimensional defects - dislocations. There is a relationship between the density of dislocations, the grain size and the resistance of a single crystal to shear loading. The mechanism of hardening processes continues to be intensively studied, and the dynamics of defects plays a central role here. In this paper, the dislocation entropy is analyzed from a combinatorial point of view and from the point of view of a physical oscillator with a given energy reserve. Both contributions play an important role in describing the free energy of a one-dimensional ensemble of dislocations, and are necessary to take into account the dynamic processes inside the grain of a polycrystalline structure.

      <title>Measured group birefringence and group velocity dispersion of elliptical-core ZBLAN fibres for mid-infrared supercontinuum generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarisation-maintaining ZBLAN optical fibres with small elliptical cores are attractive for nonlinear frequency conversion, for example in supercontinuum generation (SCG), and for dispersion management in ultrafast fibre laser systems operating in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral region. Accurate characterisation of group birefringence and group velocity dispersion (GVD) is essential for modelling ultrafast pulse propagation in such fibres, yet experimental data remain scarce. Here, we present broadband measurements of group birefringence and GVD in four elliptical-core ZBLAN fibres, selected for their potential for low-noise MIR SCG, over the wavelength range 1.4 to 4.3 $\mu$m. Using polarisation-resolved white-light spectral interferometry, we quantify the dispersion characteristics of both fundamental modes in each fibre. Measurement uncertainties are evaluated using a standard deviation analysis to ensure reliability. This work aims to support the development of MIR supercontinuum sources and to facilitate the understanding of nonlinear optical phenomena in ZBLAN fibres.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Q-BIC-like Optical Filters with High Throughput Direct-Write Multilayer Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer metasurfaces provide substantially greater spectral design freedom than single-layer devices, yet their implementation in the visible and near-infrared remains limited by the complexity, cost, and low throughput of conventional nanofabrication. Here, we establish a recently proposed direct-write electron-beam lithography approach as a high-throughput fabrication platform for multilayer resonant metasurfaces, based on an antimony precursor that decomposes in situ into high-index antimony sulfide. This method eliminates deposition-etch cycles and reduces each layer to only two fabrication steps, enabling efficient realization of multilayer architectures. Using this platform, we demonstrate multilayer q-BIC-derived metasurfaces with independently tunable resonance wavelengths and linewidths, allowing the construction of compact multi-resonant filters with spectrally decoupled layers. We experimentally demonstrate three-layer devices supporting three resonances and show independent control of resonance wavelength and Q factor across layers. Leveraging this capability, we generate decorrelated filter arrays for compressive sensing and hyperspectral reconstruction, achieving sets of 9 and 36 filters with average absolute Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.11 and 0.21, surpassing prior metasurface and photonic-crystal implementations. These results establish a practical route toward scalable multilayer resonant metasurfaces for spectral filtering, on-chip spectroscopy, and computational imaging.</description>

      <title>Holographic Mapping of Orbital Angular Momentum Using a Terahertz Diffractive Optical Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the terahertz (THz) range provides a new degree of freedom for communication and imaging systems. This study presents a compact diffractive optical neural network designed to recognize discrete and superposed OAM states at THz frequencies. The network consists of six diffractive layers trained to spatially separate nine OAM modes with topological charges from 1 to 9. Each mode is projected to a distinct position on the output plane, enabling direct recognition of its state. The structure was fabricated through low-cost 3D printing techniques with high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), allowing for scalable and practical implementations. Experimental validation at 0.3 THz demonstrates good fidelity of mode discrimination and mapping. The proposed approach offers a robust and economical pathway for OAM decoding, offering new opportunities for beam manipulation through THz systems based on diffractive optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Review of Measures Used for Evaluating Color Difference Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We made a detailed review of the difference measures which have been used to judge the differences between experimentally determined color differences and theoretically defined ones, so-called line elements, for the human visual system. To eliminate the statistical errors due to variable and usually arbitrary sampling of the directions in a color point, we integrate the measures over a complete ellipsoid/ellipse. It turns out that in the limit for small deviations from circularity all proposed measures ($V_{AB}$, $\gamma-1$, $CV$ and $\mathrm{STRESS}$) are equivalent. For greater deviations the measures become distinct with $\gamma-1$ the most sensitive and $\mathrm{STRESS}$ the least. Ideally a difference measure should be coordinate independent and then it is advantageous to apply an affine transformation to both sets, e.g. turning the theoretical one into the unit ball. Although MacAdam already used this method but sampled the transformed ellipse, we integrate over the ellipsoid/ellipse. Comparing the results with the base measures we show that only $\mathrm{STRESS}$ is coordinate independent. Judging whether a single ellipsoid/ellipse resembles a unit ball can easily be done by comparing the eigenvalues with one and we show that our previously proposed error measure $d_{ev}$ (Candry e.a. Optics Express, 30, 36307, 2022) is the eigenvalue version of $\gamma-1$. We show why the short lived correlation coefficient $r$ was justly abandoned, being very coordinate dependent, but that Pant's recent geometric measure $1-R$ on the other hand is coordinate independent. All measures are routinely made scale invariant by the introduction of a scaling parameter, to be optimized. Lastly we show that from all measures the $\gamma-1$ ones are the only ones permitting the simple derivation of the globally optimized difference measure from the locally defined ones.</description>

      <title>A unified multiscale 3D printer combining single-photon Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing and Two-Photon Polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing enables cost-effective, high-speed fabrication of complex 3D structures but is constrained by a trade-off between resolution and printing speed. Single-photon polymerization ensures rapid polymerization of centimeter-scale structures with features on the order of tens of micrometers, whereas 2PP provides sub-micrometer features at sub-millimeter scales. Here, we introduce a hybrid unified 3D printer that leverages the complementary strengths of both printing mechanisms to bridge this scale-resolution gap. We propose integrating 2PP for high-resolution, localized spatial control with single-photon TVAM for enabling rapid, high-throughput 3D fabrication. In this approach, TVAM first forms millimeter-scale volumetric structures attached on a glass rod, via overprinting, which is then accessible for subsequent high-resolution 2PP. Without needing to change the photoresin or introducing intermediate post-processing steps, we demonstrate finely printed structures via 2PP using a tightly focused femtosecond laser beam, fabricated both inside and on the surface of the millimeter-scale 3D objects printed with TVAM. Here, TVAM contributes by generating a pre-polymerized volume that facilitates subsequent 2PP and by directly driving volumetric polymerization in designated regions within seconds. We experimentally demonstrate that this dual-mode strategy provides a scalable approach for rapidly fabricating millimeter-scale 3D structures featuring sub-micrometer details. For applications like bioscaffolds and tissue engineering, tens of micrometer-scale features are sufficient across the majority of the volume with higher resolution confined to localized functional regions. For optical component manufacturing, the distinct refractive indices of the 2PP and TVAM regions can be exploited for light propagation and other micro-optical functionalities.</description>

      <title>Programmable branched flow of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic control of branched flow of light using anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. By sculpting the director field via photoalignment, we create spatially programmable optical potentials that govern light scattering and propagation. This platform enables configurable, anisotropic branched flow of light and reveals a universal scaling law for its characteristic features, directly connecting disordered photonics with mesoscopic wave transport. Under extreme anisotropy, we observe a pronounced directional channeling effect, driven by anomalous symmetry-breaking velocity diffusion, which concentrates light propagation along preferential directions while suppressing transverse spreading. These findings establish a tunable material platform for harnessing branched flow of light, opening pathways toward on-chip photonic circuits that exploit disorder-guided transport, scattering-resilient endoscopic imaging, and adaptive optical interfaces in complex media.</description>

      <title>Electrical detection of high-order optical orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light provides an infinite orthogonal basis for information capacity in optical communications and high-dimensional quantum processing. However, harnessing this potential in integrated systems is hindered by the lack of compact devices capable of direct electrical readout of high-order OAM modes. Here, we report an on-chip silicon-based integrated photodetector that directly converts optical OAM into distinguishable electrical signals without bulky interferometric or imaging optics. By leveraging a momentum-matched plasmonic coupling mechanism, the device maps vortex beams onto surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) with OAM-dependent splitting angles, thereby generating photocurrents that uniquely encode the topological charge. The incorporation of a surface dielectric lens and a split-electrode architecture further enhances mode resolution and enables chirality discrimination. The device demonstrates a wide topological charge detection range from m = -9 to 9 and achieves a record-high average OAM responsivity of 226 nA/W. By bridging the gap between vortex beams and electronic readout on a scalable platform, this work paves the way for on-chip OAM direct detection for next-generation high-capacity optical networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Coherent Detection Ghost Imaging Lidar and Vibration-Mode Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent detection ghost imaging lidar (CD-GI lidar) integrates ghost imaging with coherent detection, thereby achieving enhanced anti-interference and phase-resolved imaging capability. Here, we propose a bucket-detector-based multi-mode coherent detection scheme for CD-GI lidar, where the reflected multi-mode light fields are coherently mixed with a single-mode local oscillator (LO) at the bucket detector photosensitive plane. The bucket-detector-based multi-mode CD-GI lidar system breaks the constraints of Siegman antenna theorem by utilizing field correlation to decouple the reflected multi-mode light fields and reconstructs the spatial distribution of targets' vibration modes. Theoretical analysis of the bucket-detector-based multi-mode CD-GI lidar system is presented in this work, and its feasibility is verified through a series of experiments.</description>

      <title>Carrier-Envelope-Offset Frequency Stabilization of a High Peak and Average Power Thin-Disk Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate carrier-envelope-offset (CEO) frequency stabilization of a Kerr-lens mode-locked thin-disk oscillator delivering 180 W average power, 80 MW output peak power, and &gt;500 MW intra-cavity peak power, the highest peak power achieved in any stabilized thin-disk oscillator system. The CEO frequency detection is performed with an f-2f interferometer based on supercontinuum generation in a YAG crystal. Intra-cavity loss modulation using an acousto-optic modulator, that simultaneously provides the Kerr lens, yields 50 mrad of residual phase noise with a 250 kHz control bandwidth. After pulse compression to 0.9 GW peak power in a dual-stage multipass cell, the system directly enables high harmonic generation in noble gases. These results represent a significant step in realizing a compact and robust high-repetition-rate driver system suitable for vacuum ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Modulating Retroreflectors for CubeSat Optical Inter Satellite Links: Modeling, Optimization, and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulating retroreflectors (MRRs) offer a promising pathway to low-complexity and energy efficient asymmetric optical inter-satellite link (OISL) for small spacecrafts, such as CubeSats. In this paper, we develop a unified statistical channel model for an on off keying modulated, retroreflector-enabled OISL. The model captures both stochastic and deterministic pointing losses, as well as signal-dependent noise. Stochastic channel distributions are approximated via Monte Carlo simulation, and system optimization is carried out under CubeSat constraints using the achievable information rate as the primary metric. In addition, we derive bit-error ratio and outage probability to evaluate communication reliability. The proposed architecture is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art CubeSat laser terminals, i.e., NASA's Optical Communications and Sensors Demonstration (OCSD), DLR's OSIRIS4CubeSat, and NASA's CLICK BC. Results indicate that an optimized MRR-based transmitter can outperform OCSD and achieve performance comparable to OSIRIS4CubeSat at ranges below 500 km, while consuming only 2.5 W of power during transmission, significantly less than conventional CubeSat optical terminals.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Distributed Optical Fiber Sensing in Transportation Infrastructures: Research Progress, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS), along with its capabilities of long-range coverage, multi-parameter monitoring, and completely passive detection, emerges as one of the most promising non-destructive detection techniques for structural health monitoring (SHM) and operational assessment of linear transportation infrastructures. In this paper, we provide a state-of-the-art review on DOFS applications across typical linear infrastructure systems, encompassing highways, long-span bridges, rail transit networks, airport runways, and analogous linear structures. The comprehensive discussion consists of four critical research dimensions: 1) optical fiber selection for multi-parameter sensing and robust cable packaging techniques, 2) distributed sensing principles and signal processing algorithms, 3) diverse application scenarios in SHM and related fields, and 4) anomaly detection and event classification methodologies. Building upon the foundational introduction of DOFS technical principles and monitoring solutions for intelligent transportation infrastructure, this paper elaborates on system design approaches, sensing data analytics algorithms, and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Understanding Optical Anisotropy in Multilayer {\gamma}-InSe and {\epsilon}-GaSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional media have exhibited optical anisotropy that is unachievable in traditional 3D media due to the asymmetry of their strong, in-plane covalent bonds and weak out-of-plane van der Waals interactions. As a result, 2D media are promising building blocks for ultrathin devices such as polarimeters, polarized light sources, and active polarizers. III-VI semiconductors possess a rare property in the class of multilayered semiconductors, which is that their fundamental excitons are oriented out-of-plane. This allows them to exhibit phenomena such as transparency in the visible range while also being emissive in the visible and near-infrared ranges. Here, we report the first experimental values for the anisotropic refractive indices of {\gamma}-InSe and {\epsilon}-GaSe, and we observe the effects of the out-of-plane excitons on the c-axis refractive index. It is found that both materials exhibit moderate optical anisotropy for multilayered semiconductors. The complex, anisotropic refractive index of {\gamma}-InSe and {\epsilon}-GaSe enables the accurate simulation of these media, allowing for the design of high-performance, ultra-compact optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) combines Raman spectroscopy with scanning probe microscopy to overcome the spatial resolution limitation imposed by light diffraction, offering a primary optical technique for the comprehensive study of two-dimensional (2D) materials. In this work, we investigate an anomalous decay profile of the TERS intensity of the graphene 2D band as the tip-sample separation changes, observations enabled by high TERS efficiency and accuracy in tip-approach and tip-retract procedures. The anomalous results can be properly described by the addition of an ad hoc deformation to the effective tip-sample distance, rationalized here as due to the presence of a liquid meniscus formed via capillary forces.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a robust methodology for the 3D volumetric reconstruction of native Chileanpollen grains, specifically Gevuina avellana (hazel),Conium maculatum (hemloc) and Anthemis cotula (chamomile). Using a lens-free Digital In-line Holographic Microscopy (DLHM) system, we capture complex interference patterns that are numerically reconstructed using the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz transform. Our results demonstrate that this label-free approach provides high-fidelity morphological characterization and nanometric precision in biophysical parameter extraction, offering a scalable alternative for automated melissopalynology and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many protocols within quantum cryptography, communications, and computing require the ability to generate entangled states as well as spectral qudits. Nonlinear interferometry is a viable way to engineer these complex quantum states of light. However, it is difficult to achieve a high level of control over spectral correlations. Here, we present a protocol utilizing a nonlinear interferometer with linear spectral phases that can generate both high-dimensional spectral qudits and high-dimensional entangled states. We model the effect of loss and loss of overlap on interference visibility and thereby on the states generated.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of quantum correlations in qubit-qutrit axially symmetric states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum correlations in a hybrid qubit-qutrit system subject to both axial and planar single-ion anisotropies, dipolar spin-spin interactions, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) coupling. Using Negativity, Measurement-Induced Non-locality (MIN), Uncertainty-Induced Nonlocality (UIN), and Bell nonlocality (as quantified by the CHSH inequality) as measures, we analyze the interplay between anisotropy parameters, magnetic fields, and temperature on the survival of quantum correlations. Our results demonstrate that Bell nonlocality and entanglement (Negativity) are highly sensitive to temperature and anisotropy, exhibiting sudden death under thermal noise, whereas MIN and UIN are significantly more robust. In particular, these discord-like and information-theoretic measures provide the largest baseline and persist even in parameter regions where entanglement vanishes, highlighting their suitability as a quantumness witness in realistic conditions. Notably, our Bell nonlocality study is tailored to the asymmetric qubit-qutrit setting by exploiting a recently developed qubit-qudit CHSH maximization framework. However, Bell nonlocality is confirmed to be the most fragile, surviving only in narrow parameter windows at low temperature. A key finding of this work is that we observe the fragility hierarchy: Bell nonlocality &lt; Negativity &lt; UIN(MIN) in the qubit-qutrit setting. These results provide deeper insight into the relative robustness of distinct quantum resources in anisotropic qubit-qutrit models, suggesting that quantum discord-like measures, such as MIN and UIN, may serve as more practical resources than entanglement for quantum information tasks in thermally active spin systems.</description>

      <title>Countable basis for free electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polychromatic electromagnetic fields are typically expanded as integrals over monochromatic fields, such as plane waves, multipolar fields, or Bessel beams. However, monochromatic fields do not belong to the Hilbert space of free Maxwell fields, since their norms diverge. Moreover, the continuous frequency integrals involved in such expansions complicate the treatment of light--matter interactions via the scattering operator. Here, we identify and study a polychromatic basis for free Maxwell fields whose basis vectors belong to the Hilbert space. These vectors are defined as simultaneous eigenstates of four commuting operators with integer eigenvalues. As a consequence, the basis set is countable, and the Hilbert space is separable and isomorphic to $\ell^2$, the Hilbert space of square-summable sequences. Each basis vector represents a polychromatic single-photon wave with quantized energy and a wavelet--like temporal dependence. Three versions of this basis are defined: Regular, incoming, and outgoing. The fields of the regular basis are smooth in both space and time. The incoming and outgoing fields are likewise smooth, except at the spatial origin. These results support and motivate the use of countable bases for both the theoretical description and the practical computation of light--matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Non-Invasive Diagnosis for Clubroot Using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy and Physics-Constrained Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clubroot, a major soilborne disease affecting canola and other cruciferous crops, is characterized by the development of large galls on the roots of susceptible hosts. In this study, we present the first application of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) as a non-invasive diagnosis tool in plant pathology. Compared with conventional molecular, spectroscopic, and immunoassay-based methods, THz-TDS offers distinct advantages, including non-contact, non-destructive, and preparation-free measurement, enabling rapid in situ screening of plant and soil samples. Our results demonstrate that THz-TDS can differentiate between healthy and clubroot-infected tissues by detecting both structural and biochemical alterations. Specifically, infected roots exhibit a blue shift in the refractive index in the low-frequency THz range, along with distinct peaks-indicative of disruptions in water transport and altered metabolic activity in both roots and leaves. Interestingly, the characteristic root swelling observed in infected plants reflects internal tissue disorganization rather than an actual increase in water content. Furthermore, a physics-constrained neural network is proposed to extract the main feature in THz-TDS. A comprehensive evaluation, including time-domain signals, amplitude and phase images, refractive index and absorption coefficient maps, and principal component analysis, provides enhanced contrast and spatial resolution compared to raw time-domain or frequency signals. These findings suggest that THz-TDS holds significant potential for early, non-destructive detection of plant diseases and may serve as a valuable tool to limit their spread in agricultural systems.</description>

      <title>Polychronous Wave Computing: Timing-Native Address Selection in Spiking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spike timing offers a combinatorial address space, suggesting that timing-based spiking inference can be executed as lookup and routing rather than as dense multiply--accumulate. Yet most neuromorphic and photonic systems still digitize events into timestamps, bins, or rates and then perform selection in clocked logic. We introduce Polychronous Wave Computing (PWC), a timing-native address-selection primitive that maps relative spike latencies directly to a discrete output route in the wave domain. Spike times are phase-encoded in a rotating frame and processed by a programmable multiport interferometer that evaluates K template correlations in parallel; a driven--dissipative winner-take-all stage then performs a physical argmax, emitting a one-hot output port. We derive the operating envelope imposed by phase wrapping and mutual coherence, and collapse timing jitter, static phase mismatch, and dephasing into a single effective phase-noise budget whose induced winner--runner-up margin predicts boundary-first failures and provides an intensity-only calibration target. Simulations show that nonlinear competition improves routing fidelity compared with noisy linear intensity readout, and that hardware-in-the-loop phase tuning rescues a temporal-order gate from 55.9% to 97.2% accuracy under strong static mismatch. PWC provides a fast routing coprocessor for LUT-style spiking networks and sparse top-1 gates (e.g., mixture-of-experts routing) across polaritonic, photonic, and oscillator platforms.</description>

      <title>Noncontextual versus contextual interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman famously said that single-particle interference is ``a phenomenon which is impossible to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics.'' In this paper we show that some of the phenomenology of interference can be reproduced in a ``classical'' way, by reproducing the Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester (including their improved version) using an extension of the quantum simulation logic (QSL) formalism. Our result improves and simplifies a previous result by Catani \emph{et al}, which relies on a much more complicated extension involving a ``toy field theory.'' We also show that not all single-particle interference can be explained by such a simple extension (including that of Catani et al), by showing that Hofmann's three-path interferometer is ``nonclassical'' in a very specific sense: it violates a Kochen-Specker-noncontextual inequality. Given that both our extension of QSL and Catani et al's extension are \emph{noncontextual} -- so do not reproduce the contextual behaviour of Hofmann's three-path interferometer -- the behaviour of that interferometer is a proper example of a phenomenon that has in it the heart of quantum mechanics, according to Feynman.</description>

      <title>High Field Diamond Magnetometry Towards Tokamak Diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centres (NVC) in diamond have been widely used for near-dc magnetometry. The intrinsic properties of diamonds make them potential candidates for tokamak fusion power diagnostics, where radiation-hard magnetometers will be essential for efficient control. An NVC magnetometer placed in a tokamak will need to operate within a $\geq$ 1 T magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate fibre-coupled ensemble NVC optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and magnetometry measurements at magnetic fields up to 1.2 T. Sensitivities of approximately 240 to 600 nT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ and 110 nT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ are achieved in a (10-150) Hz frequency range, for non-degenerate and near-$\langle$111$\rangle$ field alignments respectively.</description>

      <title>Real-time visualization of plasmonic nanoparticle growth dynamics by high-speed atomic force microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoparticles generate strongly localized and enhanced light field through localized surface plasmon resonance, thereby playing a central role in plasmonics and nanophotonics. Because the optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles are highly sensitive to their size and shape, nanoscale visualization of nanoparticle growth is crucial for detailed understanding of growth mechanisms and precise control of particle geometry. However, it is not possible to visualize the rapid growth dynamics using conventional imaging techniques. In this study, we demonstrate in-situ real-time observation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) growth dynamics at the single-particle level using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). We employed a photoreduction method, which enables reliable control of AgNP formation by laser irradiation. By integrating a stand-alone tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical setup for photoreduction, we successfully captured real-time movies showing the nucleation and subsequent growth of AgNPs at the single-particle level. Furthermore, quantitative single-particle analysis revealed particle-to-particle variations in growth dynamics. The growth dynamics were further studied at different laser intensities, revealing intensity-dependent growth rates and the balance between nucleation and growth. This study establishes HS-AFM as a novel microscopic platform for in-situ visualization of plasmonic nanoparticle growth and will contribute to advances in plasmonics and materials science.</description>

      <title>Efficient local classification of parity-based material topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the classification of crystalline materials can be generally handled by momentum-space-based approaches, topological classification of aperiodic materials remains an outstanding challenge, as the absence of translational symmetry renders such conventional approaches inapplicable. Here, we present a numerically efficient real-space framework for classifying parity-based $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology in aperiodic systems based on the spectral localizer framework and the direct computation of the sign of a Pfaffian associated with a large sparse skew-symmetric matrix. Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal. Overall, our results demonstrate that the spectral localizer, combined with efficient sparse numerical methods, provides a unified and robust tool for diagnosing parity-based topological phases in aperiodic electronic, photonic, and acoustic materials where conventional band-theoretic indexes are inapplicable.</description>

      <title>Bright Heralded Single-Photon Superradiance in a High-Density Thin Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance is a hallmark of cooperative quantum emission, where radiative decay is collectively enhanced by coherence among emitters. Here, extending superradiant effects to photon pair generation from multi-level atoms, two-photon process offers a pathway to novel quantum light sources and a useful case for practical superradiance. We report bright heralded single-photon superradiance via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1-mm-long, high-density cesium vapor cell. By reducing the average distance between atoms in the atomic vapor to 0.29 times the idler photon wavelength, we observe a dramatic narrowing of the temporal two-photon wavefunction. This compression of temporal two-photon wavefunction evidences the superradiance of heralded photons in the collective two-photon emission dynamics. Furthermore, our heralded single-photon superradiance is accompanied by a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 200 and the detected photon-pair counting exceeding 10^6 pairs/s. These findings establish dense thin atomic vapors as a practical, robust medium for realizing superradiant photon sources, with immediate relevance for quantum optics and the development of efficient photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, constitute a fundamental resource for quantum technologies, enabling enhanced performance in quantum metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum communications. The practical deployment of such technologies requires squeezed-light sources that are compact, efficient, low-cost, and robust. Here we report a compact narrowband source of two-mode squeezed light at 795 nm based on four-wave mixing in hot 85Rb atomic vapor. The source is implemented in a small, modular architecture featuring a single fiber-coupled input, an electro-optic phase modulator combined with a single Fabry-Perot etalon for probe generation, and two free-space output modes corresponding to the signal and conjugate fields. Optimized for low pump power, the system achieves up to -8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing at an analysis frequency of 0.8 MHz with a pump power of only 300 mW. The intrinsic narrowband character of the generated quantum states makes this source particularly well suited for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking, including interfaces with atomic quantum memories. Our results establish a versatile and portable platform for low-SWaP squeezed-light generation, paving the way toward deployable quantum-enhanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Tripartite quantum correlations obtained by post-selection from twin beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially-resolved photon counting of a twin beam performed by an iCCD camera allows for versatile tailoring the properties of the beams formed by parts of the original twin beam. Dividing the idler beam of the twin beam into three equally-intense parts and post-selecting by detecting a given number of photocounts in the whole signal beam we arrive at the idler fields exhibiting high degrees of nonclassicality and being endowed with tripartite quantum correlations. Nonclassicality is analyzed with the help of suitable nonclassicality witnesses and their corresponding nonclassicality depths. Suitable parameters are introduced to quantify quantum correlations. These parameters are analyzed as they depend on the field intensity. The experimental photocount histograms are reconstructed by the maximum-likelihood approach and the obtained photon-number distributions are compared with a suitable model in which the original twin beam is approximated by an appropriate multi-mode Gaussian field and undergoes the corresponding beams' transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach for determining the binding energies of charged particles, such as ions and electrons, on dielectric surfaces in cryogenic liquids is introduced. The experimental technique outlined in this paper is employed to observe the buildup of charged particles on nonconductive surfaces using the electro-optic Kerr effect. The initial results of binding energy measurements on surfaces of deuterated tetraphenyl butadiene (dTPB)-coated and uncoated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in liquid nitrogen are presented. Under these conditions, the ions or electrons displayed binding energies of less than 1 meV. Although these findings were obtained in liquid nitrogen, the methodology is not limited to cryogenic liquids and is applicable to a wide variety of fluids, with no essential dependence on temperature.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the reactive power and spin of instantaneous Poynting vector in the bulk of gyromagnetic medium. It is shown that the gyromagnetic medium introduces a spin in the Poynting vector. The spin of the instantaneous Poynting vector and the relative strengths of the real and reactive power components are quantified using the Stokes plot method. Using this technique we investigate the presence of backward power propagation in a ferrite-filled waveguide. We present an analytical expression to locate the crossover point separating the forward and backward power propagation, where the real power propagation has a null. We further show that this backward power propagation leads to corresponding opposing surface currents on a waveguide plate of the ferrite-filled waveguide, while the potential difference between the two plates remain symmetric.</description>

      <title>Orders-of-magnitude reduction in photonic mode volume by nano-sculpting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving strong light-matter interaction is important for studying and exploiting several physics phenomena. The light-matter interaction strength depends on the optical field intensity in the interaction region, often measured by the Purcell factor, which for a single emitter is proportional to the spectral confinement, quantified by the cavity quality factor $Q$, and inversely proportional to the spatial localization of light, quantified by the optical model volume $V$, $F \propto \frac{Q}{V}$. While plasmonic (metallic) devices can support extreme spatial light confinement, ohmic losses reduce the cavity lifetime, thereby limiting the achievable spectral confinement. It is therefore of both practical and fundamental interest to explore the potential for achieving extreme spatial light confinement in (near) loss-less dielectric environments. Employing topology optimization we explore the limits of spatial light confinement in dielectric environments when allowing for three-dimensional sculpted dielectric nanostructures. Here we discover structures supporting optical modes that are concentrated in material (air) with mode volumes that are three (four) orders of magnitude below the so-called diffraction limit, $V_{\textbf{r}_0} \approx 4 \cdot 10^{-4} \left[\lambda/(2 n)\right]^3 \left( V_{\textbf{r}_0} \approx 3 \cdot 10^{-5} \left[\lambda/2\right]^3\right)$. Remarkably, we further discover that encapsulating the nanostructure by ellipsoidal shells enables seemingly unbounded enhancement of the mode quality factor ($Q &gt; 10^8$ demonstrated numerically) leading to theoretical Purcell factor enhancement above $10^{11}$. It is established how $V_{\textbf{r}_0}$ and $Q$ depend on the choice of material platform, device volume, minimum feature size and the number of shells. Finally a study of sensitivity towards geometric variations is presented, revealing robust behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling an emitter to a Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity can provide a coherent and strong light-matter interface whose performance in a variety of applications depends critically on the emitter-photon coupling strength. Altering the typically spherical profiles of the cavity mirrors can improve this coupling strength, but directly optimising the mirror shape is numerically challenging as the multidimensional parameter space features many local optima. Here, we develop a two-step method to optimise mirror surface profiles while avoiding these issues. First, we optimise the target cavity eigenmode for the chosen application directly, and second, we construct the mirror surfaces to retroreflect this optimised target mode at both ends of the cavity. We apply our procedure to different emitter-cavity coupling scenarios. We show that mirror shaping can increase the cooperativity of coupling to a central emitter by a factor of approximately 3 across a wide range of geometries, and that, for coupling two or more emitters to a single cavity mode, the improvement factors can far exceed an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: This work describes a self-mixing-assisted optomechanical platform for transferring information between near- and mid-infrared radiation. In particular, the self-mixing signal of a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser is used to detect the oscillation of a membrane driven by light-induced forces exerted by a near-infrared excitation beam, which is amplitude-modulated at the membrane resonance frequency. This technique benefits from spectral broadness and, therefore, can link different spectral regions from both the excitation and probe sides. This versatility can pave the way for future applications of this self-mixing-assisted optomechanical platform in communication and advanced sensing systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac vortices, originally studied in quantum field theories to predict localized zero-energy modes, were recently realized in photonics, leading to Dirac vortex cavities. With topological protection, Dirac vortex cavities offer robust single-mode large-area localized modes appealing for high-performance micro-lasers and other applications. As a spectrally-isolated single mode, the radiation of a Dirac vortex cavity mode was believed as having vanishing orbital angular momentum due to time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report the direct observation of orbital angular momentum radiation of a Dirac vortex cavity through spin-resolved measurements. Remarkably, we confirm the spin-orbital angular momentum locking in such radiation due to the spin-valley locking and inter-valley couplings. We demonstrate that the spin-orbital angular momentum locking is controlled by the chirality of the Kekul\'e modulation and propose design schemes for arbitrary-order single-mode OAM radiation.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based Terahertz Three-dimensional Holography Enabled by Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence, an emerging, powerful and efficient computational tool, has played a crucial role in the design of optical devices. For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided foundation model for universal speckle removal in ultrathin multimode fiber imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrathin multimode fibers (MMFs) promise endoscopes with hair-scale diameters for accessing sub-millimeter anatomy, but in MMF far-field imaging the required small collection aperture drives speckle-dominated measurements that rapidly degrade image fidelity. Here we present Speckle Clean Network (SCNet), a physics-guided foundation model for universal speckle removal that makes photon-limited, single-fiber collection compatible with high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse scattering conditions without target-specific retraining. SCNet combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with material-aware routing, wavelet-based frequency decomposition to separate structure from speckle across sub-bands, and a curriculum-style optimization that progressively enforces spectral consistency before spatial fidelity. Using an ultrathin dual-fiber holographic probe, we deliver wavefront-shaped illumination through one MMF and collect backscattered photons through a parallel MMF. We validate SCNet on 3D plastic objects over varying working distances, resolve 5.66 lp/mm on a paper USAF target, and restore fine structures on leaves and metal surfaces. On rabbit heart and kidney tissues, SCNet improves recovery of low-contrast anatomical texture under the same ultrathin collection constraint. We further compress SCNet through multi-teacher distillation to reduce computation while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling inference at 60 FPS. This work effectively decouples image quality from probe size, establishing a speckle-free ultrathin endoscopy for stand-off imaging in confined spaces.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Gauge-steerable Edge Modes In Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper Model</title>

Abstract: We identify steerable exponentially localized in-gap mode in a quasiperiodic non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain with a spatially fluctuating, zero-mean imaginary gauge field. Under open boundary conditions, the system is exactly related to the Hermitian AAH model by a nonunitary gauge transformation: the OBC spectrum and Lyapunov exponents are unchanged, while eigenstates acquire a gauge-dependent envelope. In a parameter region with spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we find two exponentially localized in-gap modes with sharply different responses to the imaginary gauge field. One remains boundary pinned, but the other is gauge-steerable: it stays exponentially localized while its probability maximum shifts as the gauge field is changed, with its eigenenergy unchanged. We further show that weak on-site gain, applied at a single site chosen once and then kept fixed, can dynamically prepare this steerable mode from a generic bulk wave packet. Changing the gauge field then yields exponentially localized states at different locations.</description>

      <title>Light-enhanced nonlinear Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18038v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a nontrivial Chern number results in quantized Hall conductance. What is less known is that, generically, the Hall response can be dramatically different from its quantized value in materials with broken inversion symmetry. This stems from the leading Hall contribution beyond the linear order, known as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). While the BCD is in principle always present, it is typically very small outside of a narrow window close to a topological transition and is thus experimentally elusive without careful tuning of external fields, temperature, or impurities. In this work, we transcend this challenge by devising optical driving and quench protocols that enable practical and direct access to large BCD and nonlinear Hall responses. Varying the amplitude of an incident circularly polarized laser drives a topological transition between normal and Chern insulator phases, and importantly allows the precise unlocking of nonlinear Hall currents comparable to or larger than the linear Hall contributions. This strong BCD engineering is even more versatile with our two-parameter quench protocol, as demonstrated in our experimental proposal. Our predictions are expected to hold qualitatively across a broad range of Hall materials, thereby paving the way for the controlled engineering of nonlinear electronic properties in diverse media.</description>

      <title>Anomalous quantized nonlinear Thouless pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed that a soliton resulting from nonlinearity can be pumped across an integer or fractional number of unit cells as a system parameter is slowly varied over a pump period. Nonlinear Thouless pumping is now understood as the flow of instantaneous Wannier functions, ruling out the possibility of pumping a soliton across a nonzero number of unit cells over one cycle when a corresponding Wannier function does not exhibit any flow, i.e., when the corresponding Bloch band that the soliton bifurcates from is topologically trivial. Here we surprisingly find an anomalous nonlinear Thouless pump where the displacement of a soliton over one cycle differs from the Chern number of the Bloch band from which the soliton comes. We develop a general theory showing that this anomalous behavior arises from a transition of a soliton between different Wannier functions by passing through an intersite-soliton (or dipole-soliton) state. Furthermore, we find a nonlinearity-induced integer quantized Thouless pump of a soliton, allowing a soliton to travel across one unit cell during a pump period, even when the corresponding band is topologically trivial. Our results open the door to studying nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Schr\"odinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael et al. [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75-91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode - an explicitly open quantum system - are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-Point-Induced Nonequilibrium Entanglement Dynamics in Bosonic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), arising in non-Hermitian systems, have garnered significant attention in recent years, enabling advancements in sensing, wave manipulation, and mode selectivity. However, their role in quantum systems, particularly in influencing quantum correlations, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate how EPs control multimode entanglement in bosonic chains. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework to describe the Heisenberg equations, we identify EPs of varying orders and uncover spectral transitions between purely real, purely imaginary, and mixed eigenvalue spectra. These spectral regions, divided by EPs, correspond to three distinct entanglement dynamics: oscillatory, exponential, and hybrid. Remarkably, we demonstrate that higher-order EPs, realized by non-integer-pi hopping phases or nonuniform interaction strengths, significantly enhance the degree of multimode entanglement compared to second-order EPs. Our findings provide a pathway to leveraging EPs for entanglement control and exhibit the potential of non-Hermitian physics in advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a twisted electron wave packet perturbed by an inhomogeneous electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) wave packets, known for their vortex structure and nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), are of great interest in various scientific fields. Here we study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a spatially-localized electron LG wave packet interacting with an inhomogeneous external electric field that violates the axial symmetry of the initial wave function. We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its qualitative form. We demonstrate that due to the interaction with the external field, the degenerate zeros of the initial wave function located on the $z$ axis split into multiple nondegenerate nodes in the transverse plane representing separate single-charge vortices. This mechanism resembles the analogous effects known in topological optics. These findings provide new insights into controlling and manipulating twisted matter beams and into their possible instabilities.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized light scattering imaging of a cancerous layer creeping under a healthy layer for the diagnosis of early-stage cervical cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significance: Cervical cancer progresses through cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which are precursor lesions of cervical cancer. In low-grade CIN, atypical cells generate inside the squamous epithelium, which causes the accuracy of cytodiagnosis for cervical cancer not to be very high. The grade of CIN can be estimated by the depth of atypical cell infiltration from the basal layer to the surface, rather than the abnormality of cells. Therefore, a non-invasive method is required to evaluate the depths of abnormal cells hidden at depths. Aim: Cancerous tissues beneath healthy tissues were experimentally identified by using circularly polarized light scattering (CiPLS). This method enabled the changes in the size of the cell nuclei within the penetration depth in tissue to be investigated. Approach: Artificial unexposed cancerous tissues were prepared that consisted of healthy/cancerous/healthy layers with various thicknesses of the topmost healthy layer and the cancerous layer. A polarization imaging camera with a quarter-wave plate was used to create distribution images of the circular polarization of the scattered light. Results: CiPLS images indicated that the thickness variation of the top healthy layer (the depth of the cancerous layer) caused significant changes in the degree of circular polarization. Conclusions: The depth of unexposed cancer lying within the optical penetration depth can be evaluated using a circular polarization imaging system based on the CiPLS method. These findings will lead to the development of a non-invasive optical diagnostic method for early-stage cervical cancer, potentially improving early detection and treatment outcomes.</description>

      <title>Multi-color XFEL pulses with variable color separation and time delay for multi-frame diffraction imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) of high brightness have opened new opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamical processes in matter, enabling imaging and movies of single molecules and particles at atomic resolution. In this paper, we present a straightforward method for multi-frame diffraction imaging, using the same electron beam to generate four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The optical klystron scheme is introduced to enhance FEL intensity and reduce the total length of undulators. The time delay is tuned via a magnetic chicane between the undulators with various colors. Using parameters of SHINE, start-to-end simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and tunability of our method, achieving representative results such as time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL pulses spanning 1.8 to 2.7 nm with 0.3 nm intervals. The proposed scheme enables the recording of multi-frame diffraction images in a single exposure, providing a new perspective for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Transparency-Absorption and Normal-Anomalous Dispersion Characteristics of ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ Medium or Any J-Type Configuration Atomic Vapors Subject to a Vector Magnetic Field and a Weak Resonant Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>DC response of an interferometer topology with an L-shaped cavity: a tabletop study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.</description>
