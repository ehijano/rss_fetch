      <title>A Longitudinal Analysis of Experiences with Semaglutide Across Twitter User Subpopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User experience significantly impacts pharmaceutical drug effectiveness. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter (now X), have become prominent venues for individuals to share medication-related experiences. This is especially true for semaglutide, a widely marketed drug that has sparked substantial public discourse. Despite the volume of conversation, a comprehensive understanding of how different user subpopulations engage with these discussions remains limited. Understanding such nuanced reactions is crucial for identifying public concerns, addressing misconceptions, and improving health communication. We analyzed 859,751 semaglutide-related tweets collected from July 2021 to April 2024, using sentiment and topic modeling to explore how the drug is perceived across user groups. We applied advanced analytical tools, including RoBERTa and BERTopic, to uncover trends and insights. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive sentiment and topic modeling analysis of semaglutide discourse on Twitter. Findings reveal significant sentiment differences across subpopulations: organizational accounts expressed less negative sentiment (mean -0.014) than individuals (-0.24), especially regarding efficacy and regulatory issues. Sentiment declined notably from Nov 2022 to Jan 2023, coinciding with regulatory alerts. Negativity clustered around access and side effects; positivity stemmed from success stories and endorsements. Female users engaged more with celebrity/political discussions (19.24% vs. 14.6% for males), while males showed slightly higher positivity overall. These insights inform healthcare communication and pharmacovigilance. All data were public and anonymized to ensure privacy and ethical compliance.</description>

      <title>Exploring temporal dynamics in digital trace data: mining user-sequences for communication research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication is commonly considered a process that is dynamically situated in a temporal context. However, there remains a disconnection between such theoretical dynamicality and the non-dynamical character of communication scholars' preferred methodologies. In this paper, we argue for a new research framework that uses computational approaches to leverage the fine-grained timestamps recorded in digital trace data. In particular, we propose to maintain the hyper-longitudinal information in the trace data and analyze time-evolving 'user-sequences,' which provide rich information about user activity with high temporal resolution. To illustrate our proposed framework, we present a case study that applied six approaches (e.g., sequence analysis, process mining, and language-based models) to real-world user-sequences containing 1,262,775 timestamped traces from 309 unique users, gathered via data donations. Overall, our study suggests a conceptual reorientation towards a better understanding of the temporal dimension in communication processes, resting on the exploding supply of digital trace data and the technical advances in analytical approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimal Intervention for Self-triggering Spatial Networks with Application to Urban Crime Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many network systems, events at one node trigger further activity at other nodes, e.g., social media users reacting to each other's posts or the clustering of criminal activity in urban environments. These systems are typically referred to as self-exciting networks. In such systems, targeted intervention at critical nodes can be an effective strategy for mitigating undesirable consequences such as further propagation of criminal activity or the spreading of misinformation on social media. In our work, we develop an optimal network intervention model to explore how targeted interventions at critical nodes can mitigate cascading effects throughout a Spatiotemporal Hawkes network. Similar models have been studied previously in the literature in purely temporal Hawkes networks, but in our work, we extend them to a spatiotemporal setup and demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by comparing the post-intervention reduction in intensity to other heuristic strategies in simulated networks. Subsequently, we use our method on crime data from the LA police department database to find neighborhoods for strategic intervention to demonstrate an application in predictive policing.</description>

      <title>Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</description>

      <title>Homophily Enhanced Graph Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20089v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. In this paper, we highlight the significance of graph homophily, a pivotal factor for graph domain alignment, which, however, has long been overlooked in existing approaches. Specifically, our analysis first reveals that homophily discrepancies exist in benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that homophily discrepancies degrade GDA performance from both empirical and theoretical aspects, which further underscores the importance of homophily alignment in GDA. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel homophily alignment algorithm that employs mixed filters to smooth graph signals, thereby effectively capturing and mitigating homophily discrepancies between graphs. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Sentiment spreads, but topics do not, in COVID-19 discussions within the Belgian Reddit community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how topics and sentiments on COVID-19 mitigation measures -- specifically lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccinations -- spread through the Belgian Reddit community. We explore 655,642 posts created between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2022. In line with previous studies for other countries and platforms, we find that the volume of posts on these topics can be tied to important external events, but not within-Reddit interactions. Sentiment, however, is influenced by the sentiment of previous posts, resulting in homophily and polarisation. We define a homophily measure and find values of 0.228, 0.198, and 0.133 for lockdowns, masks and vaccination, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a novel bounded confidence model that estimates internal sentiment of users from their expressed sentiment. The Wasserstein metric between the predicted and the observed sentiments takes values between 0.493 (vaccination) and 0.607 (lockdown). These results yield insight into the way the Belgian Reddit community experienced the pandemic, and which aspects influenced the topics discussed and their associated sentiment.</description>

      <title>Chi-Square Wavelet Graph Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) in heterogeneous networks presents unique challenges due to node and edge heterogeneity. Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods primarily focus on homogeneous GAD and thus fail to address three key issues: (C1) Capturing abnormal signal and rich semantics across diverse meta-paths; (C2) Retaining high-frequency content in HIN dimension alignment; and (C3) Learning effectively from difficult anomaly samples with class imbalance. To overcome these, we propose ChiGAD, a spectral GNN framework based on a novel Chi-Square filter, inspired by the wavelet effectiveness in diverse domains. Specifically, ChiGAD consists of: (1) Multi-Graph Chi-Square Filter, which captures anomalous information via applying dedicated Chi-Square filters to each meta-path graph; (2) Interactive Meta-Graph Convolution, which aligns features while preserving high-frequency information and incorporates heterogeneous messages by a unified Chi-Square Filter; and (3) Contribution-Informed Cross-Entropy Loss, which prioritizes difficult anomalies to address class imbalance. Extensive experiments on public and industrial datasets show that ChiGAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics. Additionally, its homogeneous variant, ChiGNN, excels on seven GAD datasets, validating the effectiveness of Chi-Square filters.

      <title>A Graph Perspective to Probe Structural Patterns of Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19286v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability. However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge. Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior performance.</description>

      <title>Estimating Online Influence Needs Causal Modeling! Counterfactual Analysis of Social Media Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding true influence in social media requires distinguishing correlation from causation--particularly when analyzing misinformation spread. While existing approaches focus on exposure metrics and network structures, they often fail to capture the causal mechanisms by which external temporal signals trigger engagement. We introduce a novel joint treatment-outcome framework that leverages existing sequential models to simultaneously adapt to both policy timing and engagement effects. Our approach adapts causal inference techniques from healthcare to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATE) within the sequential nature of social media interactions, tackling challenges from external confounding signals. Through our experiments on real-world misinformation and disinformation datasets, we show that our models outperform existing benchmarks by 15--22% in predicting engagement across diverse counterfactual scenarios, including exposure adjustment, timing shifts, and varied intervention durations. Case studies on 492 social media users show our causal effect measure aligns strongly with the gold standard in influence estimation, the expert-based empirical influence.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Social Media Influence Experimentation via an Agentic Reinforcement Learning Large Language Model Bot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of public opinion evolution on online social platforms is crucial for understanding influence mechanisms and the provenance of information. Traditional influence analysis is typically divided into qualitative assessments of personal attributes (e.g., psychology of influence) and quantitative evaluations of influence power mechanisms (e.g., social network analysis). One challenge faced by researchers is the ethics of real-world experimentation and the lack of social influence data. In this study, we provide a novel simulated environment that combines agentic intelligence with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test topic-specific influence mechanisms ethically. Our framework contains agents that generate posts, form opinions on specific topics, and socially follow/unfollow each other based on the outcome of discussions. This simulation allows researchers to observe the evolution of how opinions form and how influence leaders emerge. Using our own framework, we design an opinion leader that utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adapt its linguistic interaction with the community to maximize its influence and followers over time. Our current findings reveal that constraining the action space and incorporating self-observation are key factors for achieving stable and consistent opinion leader generation for topic-specific influence. This demonstrates the simulation framework's capacity to create agents that can adapt to complex and unpredictable social dynamics. The work is important in an age of increasing online influence on social attitudes and emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Structural Knowledge in Diffusion Models for Source Localization in Data-Limited Graph Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The source localization problem in graph information propagation is crucial for managing various network disruptions, from misinformation spread to infrastructure failures. While recent deep generative approaches have shown promise in this domain, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of real-world propagation data. This paper introduces SIDSL (\textbf{S}tructure-prior \textbf{I}nformed \textbf{D}iffusion model for \textbf{S}ource \textbf{L}ocalization), a novel framework that addresses three key challenges in limited-data scenarios: unknown propagation patterns, complex topology-propagation relationships, and class imbalance between source and non-source nodes. SIDSL incorporates topology-aware priors through graph label propagation and employs a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with a GNN-parameterized label propagation module (GNN-LP). Additionally, we propose a structure-prior biased denoising scheme that initializes from structure-based source estimations rather than random noise, effectively countering class imbalance issues. Experimental results across four real-world datasets demonstrate SIDSL's superior performance, achieving 7.5-13.3% improvements in F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, when pretrained with simulation data of synthetic patterns, SIDSL maintains robust performance with only 10% of training data, surpassing baselines by more than 18.8%. These results highlight SIDSL's effectiveness in real-world applications where labeled data is scarce.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of protesters scattered throughout a city who want to gather into large and mobile groups. This model relies on random walkers on a street network that follow tactics built from a set of basic rules. Our goal is to identify the most important rules for fast and robust flocking of walkers. We explore a wide set of tactics and show the central importance of a specific rule based on alignment. Other rules alone perform poorly, but our experiments show that combining alignment with them enhances flocking, and that obtained groups are then remarkably robust.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Robustness of Graph Neural Networks against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant challenges to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. This vulnerability has spurred a growing focus on designing robust GNNs. Despite this interest, current advancements have predominantly relied on empirical trial and error, resulting in a limited understanding of the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we conduct the first large-scale systematic study on the adversarial robustness of GNNs by considering the patterns of input graphs, the architecture of GNNs, and their model capacity, along with discussions on sensitive neurons and adversarial transferability. This work proposes a comprehensive empirical framework for analyzing the adversarial robustness of GNNs. To support the analysis of adversarial robustness in GNNs, we introduce two evaluation metrics: the confidence-based decision surface and the accuracy-based adversarial transferability rate. Through experimental analysis, we derive 11 actionable guidelines for designing robust GNNs, enabling model developers to gain deeper insights. The code of this study is available at https://github.com/star4455/GraphRE.</description>

      <title>SaVe-TAG: Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world graph data often follows long-tailed distributions, making it difficult for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize well across both head and tail classes. Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.</description>

Abstract: In the era of big data, managing evolving graph data poses substantial challenges due to storage costs and privacy issues. Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they rely on centralized architectures and ignore the potential of distributed graph databases to leverage collective intelligence. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple evolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and privacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of FCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and reveals two non-trivial challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local GNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose the POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by using a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer at the central server. Experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superiority over federated adaptations of CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are pretrained on large-scale corpora to learn generalizable patterns across domains and tasks -- such as contours, textures, and edges in images, or tokens and sentences in text. In contrast, discovering such generalities in graph-structured data, especially across heterogeneous graph tasks, remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose a novel approach to cross-task generalization in graphs via task-trees, which serve as unified learning instances aligning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks. We theoretically analyze the stability, transferability, and generalization properties of task-trees, showing that pretraining a graph neural network (GNN) on diverse task-trees with a reconstruction objective induces transferable knowledge. This enables efficient adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To validate our framework, we introduce Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT), a graph foundation model that demonstrates strong performance on over 30 graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, and zero-shot generalization.

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_\kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_\kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>Beyond Message Passing: Neural Graph Pattern Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph learning tasks often hinge on identifying key substructure patterns -- such as triadic closures in social networks or benzene rings in molecular graphs -- that underpin downstream performance. However, most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on message passing, which aggregates local neighborhood information iteratively and struggles to explicitly capture such fundamental motifs, like triangles, k-cliques, and rings. This limitation hinders both expressiveness and long-range dependency modeling. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Graph Pattern Machine (GPM), a novel framework that bypasses message passing by learning directly from graph substructures. GPM efficiently extracts, encodes, and prioritizes task-relevant graph patterns, offering greater expressivity and improved ability to capture long-range dependencies. Empirical evaluations across four standard tasks -- node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression -- demonstrate that GPM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that GPM exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, desirable scalability, and enhanced interpretability.

      <title>MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in Multi-Agent Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC, where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking, sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>
