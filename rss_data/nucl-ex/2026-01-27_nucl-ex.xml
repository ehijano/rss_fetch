      <title>Longitudinal Dynamics of Large and Small Systems from a 3D Bayesian Calibration of RHIC Top-energy Collision Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the 3D dynamics of high-energy nuclear collisions is presented. We perform a systematic model-to-data comparison using simulations of large and small collision systems, and a broad range of measurements from the PHENIX, STAR, PHOBOS, and BRAHMS collaborations spanning nearly two decades of RHIC operations. In particular, we perform fully 3D multi-stage simulations including rapidity-dependent energy deposition with global energy conservation using the 3D Glauber model, along with relativistic viscous hydrodynamics with MUSIC. We calibrate the model on rapidity- and $p_T$-differential observables and analyze the respective constraints on initial state and transport properties they provide. We emphasize the additional constraints provided by rapidity-dependent measurements, the differences in large and small system calibrations, and the tension exhibited by particular observables. We use our calibrated model to make predictions of observables in p-Au and $^3$He-Au collisions. Furthermore, we facilitate direct comparison of experimental measurements by highlighting the dependence of flow measurements on the rapidity of the regions of interest and reference, as well as the importance of the centrality selection. In particular, we examine the apparent differences between the STAR and PHENIX $v_2$ and $v_3$ measurements in small systems.</description>

      <title>Establishing the \textrm{\(^{\bold{40}}\)Ca(p,p$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$)} reaction at 392 MeV under quasi-free scattering conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \( (p,p\alpha) \) reaction offers a direct means to probe preformed \( \alpha \)-cluster structures in nuclei under quasi-free scattering conditions. Previous studies around \SI{100}{MeV} provided valuable insights into \( \alpha \) clustering, but quantitative comparison with microscopic cluster wave functions remained limited due to strong distortion effects. At higher energies, the reaction mechanism becomes simpler and the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) provides a more reliable framework for quantitative analysis. In the present work, the \isotope[40]{Ca}\( (p,p\alpha) \) reaction was measured at an incident energy of \SI{392}{MeV} using the high-resolution Grand Raiden and LAS spectrometers at RCNP. Despite the small cross section in this energy region, the achieved resolution allowed clear separation of the ground and excited states of the residual \isotope[36]{Ar} nucleus, and corresponding momentum distributions were extracted. %These results provided the first direct evidence of the \( \alpha \)-cluster component in \isotope[40]{Ca} at high energy. DWIA calculations using a Woods--Saxon \( \alpha + \isotope[36]{Ar} \) bound-state wave function yielded an experimental spectroscopic factor of \( S_{\mathrm{FAC}}^{\mathrm{WS}} = 0.51 \pm 0.05 \), consistent with the previous result at \SI{101.5}{MeV} (\(0.52 \pm 0.23 \)). This agreement demonstrates that the reaction mechanism is well described across a wide energy range. The present study establishes the feasibility of high-precision \( (p,p\alpha) \) measurements at several hundred MeV and highlights their potential as a quantitative probe of \( \alpha \) clustering in medium-mass nuclei, forming the basis for systematic studies in both stable and unstable systems.</description>

      <title>The phase structure of QCD: Fluctuations and Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong interaction - governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) - shapes the structure of the visible universe. At about 10 $\mu$s after the big bang, the primordial matter made up of quarks and gluons plus leptons, photons and neutrinos, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), became cool enough to create, in a phase transition, the protons and neutrons of ordinary matter, along with other strongly interacting unstable hadrons. This phase transition was predicted within the framework of QCD and has been studied in accelerator laboratories world-wide since about 40 years. This review will explore recent breakthroughs in the study of the QCD phase diagram. We will highlight measurements of particle production and fluctuations, and compare them to theoretical predictions. We summarize our current understanding of the QCD structure and outline future experimental opportunities with high energy nuclear collisions at fixed-target and collider facilities world-wide.</description>

      <title>Level structure of light neutron-rich La isotopes beyond the N=82 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high spin excited states of Lanthanum isotopes $^{140-143}$La, above the $N=82$ closed shell, have been populated in fission reactions. The prompt $\gamma$-ray transitions were measured using two complementary methods; a) in coincidence with the isotopically identified fragments produced in the fission of the $^{238}$U+$^{9}$Be system using the VAMOS++ and the AGATA spectrometers and b) high statistics three-fold $\gamma-\gamma-\gamma$ and four-fold $\gamma-\gamma-\gamma-\gamma$ coincidence data from the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf using the Gammasphere. This work reports the first identification of a pair of parity doublet structures in $^{143}$La and the new high spin level structure in $^{140-142}$La from prompt $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. The level structures are interpreted in terms of the systematics of neighbouring odd-$Z$ nuclei above $Z=50$ shell closure and large-scale shell model calculations. The present results indicate the presence of stable octupole deformation, in $^{143}$La. The excitation energy pattern and their comparison with neighbouring isotones, moving away from the N=82 closed shell, point towards a transition from single particle structures to an alternating parity rotational band structure in the La isotopic chain.</description>

      <title>First observation of multi-phonon $\gamma$-vibrations in an odd-odd nuclear system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of the first multi-phonon $\gamma$-vibrational bands in an odd-odd neutron-rich nucleus of the nuclear chart is presented. These high spin structures of hard to access $^{104}_{41}$Nb$_{63}$, produced in fission, were studied by combining a spectrometer with isotopic resolution coupled to a $\gamma$-ray tracking array and independently high-fold $\gamma$ coincidence measurements. Triaxial Projected Shell Model calculations for the high-spin states are in good agreement with the measured observables for the yrast, one-phonon and two-phonon $\gamma$ bands. The possibility of an oblate shape of an isomeric state and coexistence of triaxial and oblate configurations are investigated from the decay of the 141 keV isomer. The present work illustrates the robustness of vibration excitations in the presence of odd valence proton and neutron as well as the possibly coexisting shapes beyond the $N=60$ transitional region.</description>

Abstract: After the recent success of acceleration molecular H$_2^+$ beam (from EBIS) in Booster to 1.0 GeV/u kinetic energy, we propose to carry out tests to accelerate H$_2^+$ beam in AGS (up to 12 GeV/u) and to RHIC (up to 100 GeV/u). In this Note, we address the main effects that might hamper H$_2^+$ beam acceleration, outline the impacts and benefits of high energy H$_2^+$ beam to BNL.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Gamma-Neutron Source Classification in Water Cherenkov Detectors: Energy Threshold Screening and Machine Learning Pulse Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water Cherenkov detectors offer a robust and economical solution for real-time radiation monitoring by detecting Cherenkov light from charged particles moving faster than light in water. This work presents a novel two-stage classification framework for gamma-neutron discrimination: an initial physics-based energy threshold filters unambiguous low-energy gamma sources, followed by a machine learning ensemble that resolves ambiguities at higher energies. The detector response was characterized using $^{60}$Co (1.17/1.33~MeV), $^{137}$Cs (0.66~MeV), and a shielded $^{241}$AmBe source, with lead, paraffin, and cadmium shielding employed to isolate neutron and gamma interactions. Energy calibration established a linear ADU to MeV conversion ($R^2 = 0.966$), enabling identification of a neutron detection threshold at $2.62 \pm 0.77$~MeV via a $3\sigma$ significance analysis. Stage one categorizes sources as pure gamma (below threshold) or neutron-emitting (at threshold). For ambiguous cases above threshold, a machine learning pipeline utilizing pulse shape analysis was developed. A soft voting ensemble (Bagging, CatBoost, and MLP) achieved an accuracy of 0.816 and an AUC of 0.921. This hybrid scheme combines physics-based filtering with ML refinement, offering an interpretable and scalable solution for nuclear security, nonproliferation monitoring, and fundamental radiation research.</description>

      <title>Basis Representation for Nuclear Densities from Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an efficient method to represent nuclear densities using basis functions extracted via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Applying PCA to densities of 75 nuclei calculated with the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory yields an orthogonal set of components that efficiently capture the dominant features of nuclear density distributions, which can be used as basis functions for nuclear density representation. The first five basis functions account for more than 99.999\% of the total variance, demonstrating the efficiency of these PCA basis functions. The PCA basis achieves significantly higher accuracy and faster convergence than the Fourier-Bessel and Sum-of-Gaussians methods for reconstructing both theoretical and experimental densities. This approach provides an efficient and robust representation of nuclear densities, offering a practical tool for experimental density representation and for theories where densities play a central role, such as the orbital-free density functional theory, or the double folding model for nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>Polyurethane-Based Scintillators for Neutron and Gamma Radiation Detection in Medical and Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic scintillators using a solid polyurethane (PU) matrix have been introduced to combine the robustness of a construction material with scintillating properties that allow gamma rays and fast neutrons to be detected efficiently and at low cost. This work compares two corresponding materials, the older M600 and the more recent M700, with EJ-276D and EJ-200 representing common plastic scintillators with and without pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) capabilities, respectively. Characterization measurements were performed with small samples of 26 mm diameter and 10 mm height, which were coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and simultaneously exposed to 252Cf fission neutrons and 137Cs gamma rays. M700 turned out to provide the best PSD performance and about the same light yield as EJ-276D, while its light pulses exhibit a shorter pulse decay. An accelerated ageing process applied in between two test campaigns was too short to trigger distinct performance degradation in any of the materials, though optical degradation was visible in EJ-276D and in EJ-200 but not in the PU-based materials. Nevertheless, the extremely robust polyurethane matrix promises advantages in medical and industrial applications where resilience and long-term stability are of crucial importance.</description>

      <title>Production of high-spin $\omega_J/\rho_J$ ($J=3,4,5$) mesons in $\pi^{-}p$ reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of the production of high-spin $\omega_J$ and $\rho_J$ mesons ($J=3,4,5$) in $\pi^{-}p$ reactions using an effective Lagrangian approach. By constructing the relevant $t$-channel processes and calibrating the model with a single adjustable parameter fitted to existing data, we successfully reproduce the measured total and differential cross sections for the $J=3$ states $\omega_3(1670)$ and $\rho_3(1690)$. Within the same framework, we predict the production cross sections for the higher-spin partners $\omega_4(2250)$, $\rho_4(2230)$, $\omega_5(2250)$, and $\rho_5(2350)$. Our results show that these states exhibit measurable cross sections with characteristically forward-peaked angular distributions, underscoring their strong potential for observation in future $\pi p$ meson-beam experiments.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized parton distribution functions for spin-1 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-1 hadrons contain different aspects of spin physics from the ones of the spin-1/2 nucleon because of the existence of tensor-polarized structure functions. In the charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering from a spin-1 hadron or nucleus, such as the deuteron, there are leading-twist structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. In addition, there exists a gluon transversity which does not exist in the spin-1/2 nucleon. In the deuteron, these observables could probe interesting dynamical aspects beyond a simple bound system of a proton and a neutron. In addition, there are recent theoretical studies on higher-twist distributions. Tensor-polarized deuteron experiments are now under preparation at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, so that the topic of polarized deuteron is expected to become one of exciting fields in hadron physics. This paper is a brief overview on the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions, including transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions up to twist 4.</description>

Abstract: There has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering reactions ($e^+ e^- \to B \bar B$), in the last two decades. Timelike experiments reveal information about the distribution of charge and magnetism inside the hyperons that cannot be obtained in spacelike experiments (electron scattering on baryons). Motivated by the novel data, we extend to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting, a covariant quark model developed for the spacelike region that takes into account the meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. We use the formalism to calculate the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin 1/2 baryons in the large square transfer momentum $q^2$ region. Our calculations are compared with the available data from CLEO and BESIII above $q^2=10$ GeV$^2$. We conclude that our predictions for the effective form factors (combination between $G_E$ and $G_M$) are in good agreement with the $q^2 &gt; 15$ GeV$^2$ data for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$, $\Sigma^0$, $\Xi^-$ and $\Xi^0$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^-$ can be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the available data for ratio $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ data range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be performed by upcoming data above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear effects on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio in the deuteron</title>

Abstract: Nuclear modifications of the nucleon's structure function $F_2^N$ have been investigated mainly since the discovery of the EMC nuclear effect in 1983, and there were many experimental measurements from the deuteron to a heavy nucleus. Now, the details of the modifications of $F_2^N$ are known from small $x$ to large $x$. On the other hand, it is taken as granted that a nuclear modification does not exist for the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$. However, such a nuclear modification does exist theoretically. A nucleon in a nucleus moves in any space direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction along the virtual-photon momentum in charged-lepton scattering. Because of this transverse Fermi motion, the longitudinal and transverse structure functions mix with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse-momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this paper, the nuclear modifications are shown numerically for the deuteron by using a standard convolution description. The magnitude of the modifications is of the order of a few percent in the deuteron; however, they should be large in large nuclei. In handling high-energy nuclear data, such nuclear modifications need to be taken into account for a precise determination of physical quantities. Now, the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio and tensor-polarized experiments are under preparation for the deuteron at JLab. We hope that such effects will be confirmed experimentally for not only for the deuteron but also for larger nuclei.</description>

      <title>The mass of $^{101}$Sn and Bayesian extrapolations to the proton drip line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The favorable energy configurations of nuclei at magic numbers of ${N}$ neutrons and ${Z}$ protons are fundamental for understanding the evolution of nuclear structure. The ${Z=50}$ (tin) isotopic chain is a frontier for such studies, with particular interest at and around the doubly-magic \textsuperscript{100}Sn isotope, for which the mass is a topic of debate. Precise mass values for neutron-deficient isotopes provide necessary anchor points for mass models to test extrapolations near the proton drip line, where experimental studies remain out of reach. In this work, we report the first Penning trap mass measurement of \textsuperscript{101}Sn. The determined mass excess of $-59\,889.89(96)$~keV for \textsuperscript{101}Sn represents a factor of 300 improvement over the current precision and indicates that \textsuperscript{101}Sn is less bound than previously thought. Mass predictions from a recently developed Bayesian model combination (BMC) framework employing statistical machine learning and nuclear masses computed within seven global models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory (DFT) agree within 1$\sigma$ with experimental masses from the $48 \le Z \le 52$ isotopic chains. The framework's resilience to new mass data gave confidence in the extrapolation of tin masses down to $N=46$. Our calculations suggest that \textsuperscript{96}Sn is a two-proton drip line nucleus and predict a mass excess of $-58\,090(800)$~keV for $^{100}$Sn, showing a preference within 1$\sigma$ for the mass of \textsuperscript{100}Sn derived from the $\beta$-delayed $Q$-value measured at GSI.</description>

Abstract: Using $(1.0087\pm0.0044)\times10^{10}$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring, the reactions $\Sigma^{+}n\rightarrow\Lambda p$ and $\Sigma^{+}n\rightarrow\Sigma^{0}p$ are studied, where the $\Sigma^{+}$ baryon is produced in the process $J/\psi\rightarrow\Sigma^{+}\bar{\Sigma}^-$ and the neutron is a component of the $^9\rm{Be}$, $^{12}\rm{C}$ and $^{197}\rm{Au}$ nuclei in the beam pipe. Clear signals of these two reactions are observed for the first time. Their cross sections are measured to be $\sigma(\Sigma^{+}+{^9\rm{Be}}\rightarrow\Lambda+p+X)=(45.2\pm12.1_{\rm{stat}}\pm7.2_{\rm{sys}})$ mb and $\sigma(\Sigma^{+}+{^9\rm{Be}}\rightarrow\Sigma^{0}+p+X)=(29.8\pm9.7_{\rm{stat}}\pm6.9_{\rm{sys}})$ mb for a $\Sigma^{+}$ average momentum of $0.992$ GeV/$c$, within a range of $\pm0.015$ GeV/$c$, where $X$ represents the residual nucleus. This is the first study of $\Sigma^{+}$-nucleon scattering at an electron-positron collider.</description>

      <title>Timelike electromagnetic form factors of hyperons at large $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few years there has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering, with increasing squared transfer momentum $q^2$. The modulus of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors has been measured for nucleons, hyperons and other baryons at BaBar, CLEO, Belle and BESIII. The novel measurements motivated the extension of a covariant quark model, developed to the spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$), to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting. The extension is based on asymptotic relations derived from analyticity and unitarity, valid for the large-$q^2$ region. We use the model to make predictions for the effective form factor $|G|$ (combination of $G_E$ and $G_M$) and the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for spin 1/2 hyperons at large $q^2$ (above 10 GeV$^2$). Our calculations are in good agreement with the data from CLEO and BESIII for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^-$ above $q^2=15$ GeV$^2$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^-$ and $\Xi^-$ at large $q^2$ may be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the scarce available data for $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be made by experiments above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Physical Thickness Characterization of the FRIB Production Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FRIB heavy-ion accelerator, commissioned in 2022, is a leading facility
  for producing rare isotope beams (RIBs) and exploring nuclei beyond the limits of stability.
  These RIBs are produced via reactions between stable primary beams and a graphite target.
  Approximately 20-40 \% of the primary beam power is deposited in the target,
  requiring efficient thermal dissipation.
  Currently, FRIB operates with a primary beam power of up to 20 kW. To enhance thermal dissipation efficiency,
  a single-slice rotating graphite target with a diameter of approximately 30 cm is employed.
  The effective target region is a 1 cm-wide outer rim of the graphite disc.
  To achieve high RIB production rates, the areal thickness variation must be constrained within 2 \%.
  This paper presents physical thickness characterizations of FRIB production targets with various nominal thicknesses,
  measured using a custom-built non-contact thickness measurement apparatus.</description>

Abstract: BUTTON-30 is a neutrino detector demonstrator located in the STFC Boulby underground facility in the north-east of England. The main goal of the project is to deploy and test the performance of the gadolinium-loaded water-based liquid scintillator for neutrino detection in an underground environment. This will pave the way for a future large-volume neutrino observatory that can also perform remote monitoring of nuclear reactors for nonproliferation. This paper describes the design and construction of the watertight optical modules of the experiment.</description>
