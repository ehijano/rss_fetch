      <title>Decoding Financial Behaviour: An Analysis of urbanised households in India using AIDIS 77th round</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper delves into the financial behavior of urbanized households in India, specifically focusing on million-plus agglomerations. Using data from the 77th round of the All India Debt and Investment Survey, the study analyzes assets, borrowing patterns, and the usage of financial instruments like bank accounts, e-wallets, and life insurance. The research explores demographic factors, household structures, and district-level parameters to understand the intricate financial landscape. With a focus on low-income households, the study identifies income, education, type of employment, and branches per capita as significant factors influencing financial behavior. The study contributes valuable insights for financial institutions, policymakers, and researchers seeking a comprehensive understanding of the financial lives of urban households in India.</description>

      <title>A Rule-Based Methodology for Company Identification: Application to the Downstream Space Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an original methodology based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify companies involved in downstream space activities, i.e., companies that provide services or products exploiting data and technology from space. Using a rule-based approach, the method leverages a corpus of texts from digitized French press articles to extract company names related to the downstream space segment. This approach allowed the detection of 88 new downstream space companies, enriching the existing database of the sector by 33\%. The paper details the identification process and provides guidelines for future replications, applying the method to other geographic areas, or adapting it to other industries where new entrants are challenging to identify using traditional activity classifications.</description>

      <title>Driving Reductions in Emissions Unlocking the Potential of Fuel Economy Targets in Saudi Arabia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of more stringent fuel economy standards represents a pivotal pathway toward achieving net zero emissions in the transportation sector. By steadily increasing the fuel efficiency of vehicles, this approach drives a gradual but consistent decline in emissions. When coupled with the simultaneous integration of electric and alternative fuel vehicles into the market, the goal of net zero emissions becomes increasingly feasible.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Company Similarity with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining company similarity is a vital task in finance, underpinning hedging, risk management, portfolio diversification, and more. Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications to gauge similarity, such as SIC-codes and GICS-codes, the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Clustering embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential technique for determining company similarity, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models by decomposing LLM activations into interpretable features. In this paper, we explore the use of SAE features in measuring company similarity and benchmark them against (1) SIC codes and (2) Major Group codes. We conclude that SAE features can reproduce and even surpass sector classifications in quantifying fundamental characteristics of companies, evaluated by the correlation of monthly returns, a proxy for similarity, and PnL from cointegration.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Markets for Differentially-Private Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data is an increasingly vital component of decision making processes across industries. However, data access raises privacy concerns motivating the need for privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy. Data markets provide a means to enable wider access as well as determine the appropriate privacy-utility trade-off. Existing data market frameworks either require a trusted third party to perform computationally expensive valuations or are unable to capture the combinatorial nature of data value and do not endogenously model the effect of differential privacy. This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a valuation mechanism based on the Wasserstein distance for differentially-private data, and corresponding procurement mechanisms by leveraging incentive mechanism design theory, for task-agnostic data procurement, and task-specific procurement co-optimisation. The mechanisms are reformulated into tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programs, which are validated with numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Pollution and Mortality: Evidence from early 20th Century Sweden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic growth in Sweden during the early 20th Century was largely driven by industry. A significant contributor to this growth was the installation of different kinds of engines used to power factories. We use newly digitized data on engines and their energy source by industry sector, and combine this with municipality-level data of workers per industry sector to construct a new variable reflecting economic output using dirty engines. In turn, we assess the average externality of dirty output on mortality in the short-run, as defined by deaths over the population in the baseline year. Our results show substantial increases of up to 17% higher mortality in cities where large increases to dirty engine installations occurred, which is largely driven by the elderly. We also run a placebo test using clean powered industry and find no effect on mortality.</description>
