      <title>Tuning excitons and superfluidity of dipolar excitons in the double layers of kagome lattice by applying circularly polarized irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present detailed calculations for several significant properties of the kagome lattice. We employ the Floquet-Magnus perturbation expansion to obtain the energy bands and the corresponding wave functions near the Dirac points for the kagome lattice in the presence of circularly or linearly polarized irradiation. In contrast with linearly polarized irradiation, a band gap is opened up near the Dirac points, between the valence and conduction bands in the presence of circularly polarized irradiation. We calculated the exciton binding energy, and the exciton energy for gapped kagome lattice as a function of the frequency and intensity of the irradiation. We compare the exciton binding energy and exciton energy in a monolayer with those in a double layer separated by an insulator to inhibit recombination. We predict that a phase transition in the kagome lattice from the semiconducting phase to the excitonic insulating phase can be induced by applying irradiation. We also examined the conditions for such a phase transition. We explore opportunities to tune exciton binding energy, the energy spectrum of collective excitations, the sound velocity and the critical temperature of the superfluidity by applying circularly polarized irradiation. We propose observation of Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity of quasi-two-dimensional dipolar excitons in two-layer kagome lattices in the presence of pumping by circularly polarized light. We have also analyzed the dependence of superfluid density $n_s$ and the temperature of the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition temperature on excitonic density n, the interlayer separation D and the parameters for circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>The role of small-angle electron-electron scattering in transverse magnetic focusing experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the crucial role of small-angle scattering in transverse magnetic focusing (TMF) in ballistic GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Measurements in various samples show that the role significantly depends on their geometry. We propose a phenomenological model parameterizing this dependence with the angular acceptance of the detecting contact. This model is consistent with the diversity of experimental data and therefore enables accurate extraction of the key characteristic of inter-electron (e-e) interaction $\unicode{x2013}$ the e-e scattering length $\unicode{x2013}$ from TMF experiment, thus turning it into a uniquely effective tool for studying e-e scattering.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic In-plane Thermal Conductivity of Freestanding Few-layer ReS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhenium disulfide (ReS2) is a unique TMDC with a strong in-plane anisotropy and weak interlayer coupling. The pronounced anisotropy in the thermal conductivity observed in bulk ReS2 flakes (exceeding 60 nm) makes them valuable for applications that require directional heat management or isolation. Whether this anisotropy is maintained below 10 nm has not yet been studied. Here, we measured the thermal conductivity of freestanding, exfoliated, few-layer ReS2 samples (thickness &lt; 10 nm) on SiO2/Si holey substrates using the optothermal Raman technique. Polarization-dependent Raman measurements revealed variation in thermal conductivity along the high symmetry axes. The total in-plane thermal conductivities show a nonmonotonic trend with ReS2 thickness ranging from 2.5 to 8 nm. The in-plane thermal conductivity of few-layer ReS2 devices, which varies with thickness, holds significant potential for applications in nanoscale thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Hall effect in isolated flat-band systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hall effect in isolated flat-band systems (i.e., a flat band is separated from other bands) for a weak magnetic field. In a naive semiclassical picture, the Hall conductivity vanishes when dispersive bands are unoccupied since there is no mobile carrier. To go beyond the semiclassical picture, we establish a fully quantum mechanical gauge-invariant formula for the Hall conductivity that can be applied to any lattice models. We apply the formula to a general two-band model with one dispersive and one isolated flat band, and find that the total conductivity takes a universal form as an integral of a product of the squared Berry curvature and energy difference between the two bands. In particular, the Hall coefficient can become nonzero in the flat-band systems with broken inversion symmetry. We numerically confirm this Hall effect for an isolated flat-band lattice model on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Identifying Clean and Contaminated Atomic-Sized Gold Contacts under Ambient Conditions Using a Clustering Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular electronics studies have advanced from early, simple single-molecule experiments at cryogenic temperatures to complex and multifunctional molecules under ambient conditions. However, room-temperature environments increase the risk of contamination, making it essential to identify and quantify clean and contaminated rupture traces (i.e., conductance versus relative electrode displacement) within large datasets. Given the high throughput of measurements, manual analysis becomes unfeasible. Clustering algorithms offer an effective solution by enabling automatic classification and quantification of contamination levels. Despite the rapid development of machine learning, its application in molecular electronics remains limited. In this work, we present a methodology based on the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to extract representative traces from both clean and contaminated regimes, providing a scalable and objective tool to evaluate environmental contamination in molecular junction experiments.</description>

      <title>Temperature gradient-driven motion of magnetic domains in a magnetic metal multilayer by entropic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the displacement of magnetic domains under temperature gradients in perpendicularly magnetized Ta/[Pt/Co$_{68}$B$_{32}$/Ir]$_{\times 10}$/Pt multilayer tracks with microfabricated Pt heaters/thermometers by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Subtracting out the effects of the Oersted field from the heating current reveals the pure temperature gradient-driven motion, which is always towards the heater. The higher the thermal gradient along the track (owing to proximity to the heater or larger heater currents), the greater the observed displacements of the domains, up to a velocity of around 1~nm/s in a temperature gradient of 20~K/$\mu$m. Quantitative estimates of the strength of different driving mechanisms show that entropic forces dominate over those arising from the spin Seebeck and spin-dependent Seebeck effects.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phases and zone-folded phonons in a frustrated van der Waals magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D magnetic materials have attracted extensive research interest due to their potential application in nanospintronics, optospintronics, and in magnonics. Ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic layered materials have been demonstrated and successfully inserted into van der Waals heterostructures. However, the effects of magnetic frustration in van der Waals materials and the possibilities offered by spin configurations characterized by nonlinear spin arrangements have not been fully considered yet. Herein, we establish the magnetic phase diagram of bulk CrOCl, a frustrated van der Waals magnet, using magnetization and magneto-optical spectroscopy techniques. In particular, we use the magnetic superstructures relative to the crystallographic unit cell and the associated rich zone-folded phonon series to describe the magnetic field induced phases. Theoretical calculations taking into account the competing nearest neighbors magnetic exchange interactions provide a unique insight into the lattice vibrations of this class of magnetic system. This study expands the scope of 2D magnetic materials and provides a methodology to characterize frustrated van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Magnon-polaron control in a surface magnetoacoustic wave resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling between distinct quasiparticles in condensed matter systems gives rise to hybrid states with emergent properties. We demonstrate the hybridization of confined phonons and finite-wavelength magnons, forming a magnon-polaron cavity with tunable coupling strength and spatial confinement controlled by the applied magnetic field direction. Our platform consists of a low-loss, single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film coupled to a zinc oxide (ZnO)-based surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator. This heterostructure enables exceptionally low magnon-polaron dissipation rates below $\kappa / 2\pi &lt; 1.5\;$MHz. The observed mode hybridization is well described by a phenomenological model incorporating the spatial profiles of magnon and phonon modes. Furthermore, we report the first observation of Rabi-like oscillations in a coupled SAW-spin wave system, revealing the dynamical formation of magnon-polarons in the time domain. These results establish a platform for engineering hybrid spin-acoustic excitations in extended magnetic systems and enable time-resolved studies of magnon-polaron states.</description>

      <title>Hidden degree of freedom implied by unusual nonlocal transport in a topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects have established a principle to understand nonlocal charge transport due to an additional degree of freedom. This principle applies successfully to the nonlocal transport due to the valley degree of freedom in graphene or to the chiral degree of freedom in a Weyl semimetal. Here we report the discovery of an unusual nonlocal charge transport that cannot be explained by any known mechanism and hence points to the existence of a hidden degree of freedom. This phenomenon was found in ZrTe$_5$ in the nodal-line semimetal phase and it occurs in the ultraquantun limit driven by the magnetic field applied along the $a$-axis. Surprisingly, the decay length of the nonlocality increases linearly with the sample width and exceeds 100 $\mu$m, suggesting that the relevant degree of freedom experiences little scattering. This nonlocal transport shows up not only as a longitudinal voltage gradient, but also as an unusual nonlocal Hall effect. Such an exotic phenomenon in a topological material is unprecedented and implies new physics.</description>

      <title>Generic Chiral Anomaly and Planar Hall Effect in a Non-Weyl System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The condensed-matter version of the chiral anomaly describes how electrons are pumped from a Weyl node with negative chirality to a Weyl node with positive chirality using parallel electric and magnetic fields. Key experimental signatures are a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE), both of which have been experimentally observed. Here, we show that the chiral anomaly explains key features of magnetotransport in the nodal-line semimetal ZrTe$_5$ despite the absence of Weyl points. The anomaly physics applies generically to materials in the quantum limit, when electron transport becomes quasi-one-dimensional, provided that Fermi velocities remain sufficiently large. This explains not only the negative LMR but also the PHE with a gigantic Hall angle and a highly unusual magnetic-field-angle dependence in ZrTe$_5$.</description>

      <title>Probing anyon statistics on a single-edge loop in the fractional quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a setup to directly measure the anyonic statistical angle on a single edge of a fractional quantum Hall system, without requiring independent knowledge of non-universal parameters. We consider a Laughlin edge state bent into a closed loop geometry, where tunneling processes are controllably induced between the endpoints of the loop. To illustrate the underlying physical mechanism, we compute the time-dependent current generated by the injection of multiple anyons, and show that its behavior exhibits distinctive features governed by the anyonic statistical angle. The measured current reflects quantum interference effects due to the time-resolved braiding of anyons at the junction. To establish experimental relevance, we introduce a protocol where anyons are probabilistically injected upstream of the loop via a quantum point contact (QPC) source. Unlike in Fabry-Perot interferometers, where phase jumps occur spontaneously due to stochastic quasi-particle motion, here the phase jumps are deliberately induced by source injections. These events imprint measurable signatures in the cross-correlation noise, enabling a controlled statistical analysis of the braiding phase. We further show that, by varying the magnetic field while remaining within the same fractional quantum Hall plateau, the statistical angle can be extracted without relying on the knowledge of other non-universal system parameters. Our results provide a minimal and accessible platform for probing anyonic statistics using a single chiral edge.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced directional transport in extended SSH chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</description>

      <title>Influence of photon-magnon coupling to enhance spin-wave excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in magnonics is the efficiency of the conversion of microwave signals into spin waves. This efficiency is low due to the significant mismatch between microwave and spin wave wavelengths in the GHz range $10^{-2}$ m and $10^{-8}$ m, respectively, leading to high energy consumption in magnonic circuits. To address this issue, we propose an approach based on a planar inverse split-ring resonator (ISRR) loaded with a nanometer-thick Py film and exploiting the photon-magnon coupling effect. Our numerical studies show that the ISRR-based antenna achieves more than a fourfold improvement in conversion efficiency compared to a conventional single microstrip transmission line at frequencies and bias magnetic fields around the anti-crossing frequency gap. This has been demonstrated in the weak photon-magnon coupling regime for the nanometer-thin permalloy film with micrometer lateral dimensions. Further optimization of the ISRR can help to achieve the strong coupling regime, making the system potentially useful for quantum technology. Our compact and efficient antenna design offers a significant advantage over standard microstrip lines, paving the way for scalable and powerful magnonic circuits for microwave signal processing.</description>

      <title>Optical spin pumping in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of an out-of-equilibrium population of spin-polarized carriers is a keystone process for quantum technologies and spintronics alike. It can be achieved through the so-called optical spin orientation by exciting the material with circularly polarized light. Although this is an established technique for studying direct band-gap semiconductors, it has been proven limited in materials like Si that possess weak oscillator strengths for the optical transitions. In this study, we address the problem by presenting an all-optical analog of the spin pumping method. This involves the optical creation of a non-equilibrium spin population within an absorber, which subsequently transfers spin-polarized carriers to a nearby indirect gap semiconductor, resulting in polarized emission from the latter. By applying this concept to a Ge-on-Si heterostructure we observe luminescence from Si with an unrivaled polarization degree as high as 9%. The progressive etching of the absorbing layer, assisted by magneto-optic experiments, allows us to ascertain that the polarized emission is determined by effective spin injection aided by the carrier lifetime shortening due to extended defects. These findings can facilitate the use of highly promising spin-dependent phenomena of Si, whose optical exploitation has thus far been hampered by fundamental limitations associated with its peculiar electronic structure.</description>

Here, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the sliding ferroelectricity-mediated topological transitions in bilayer MBi2Te4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb). By strategically engineering interlayer sliding configurations with oppositely polarized states, we demonstrate reversible band inversion accompanied by topological phase transitions. The calculated spin-orbit-coupled bandgaps reach 31 meV (GeBi2Te4), 36 meV (SnBi2Te4), and 35 meV (PbBi2Te4), thereby enabling room-temperature observation of the quantum spin Hall effect. Crucially, these systems exhibit substantial out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization magnitudes of 0.571-0.623 pC/m, with PbBi2Te4 showing the maximum polarization (0.623 pC/m). The topological nontriviality is unambiguously confirmed by two independent signatures: (i) the computed z2 topological invariant, and (ii) the emergence of gapless helical edge states spanning the bulk insulating gap. This synergy arises from the unique sliding-induced charge redistribution mechanism, which simultaneously modulates Berry curvature and breaks in-plane inversion symmetry without disrupting out-of-plane polarization stability. The co-engineering of non-volatile ferroelectric switching and topologically protected conduction channels in MBi2Te4 bilayers establishes a material paradigm for designing reconfigurable quantum devices, where electronic topology can be electrically controlled via polarization reversal. Our results provide critical insights into manipulating correlated quantum states in van der Waals ferroelectrics for multifunctional nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Efficient broadband terahertz generation by above band-gap excitation of the pyroelectric ZnSnN2</title>

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful probe of low-energy excitations in all phases of matter. However, it remains a challenge to find materials that efficiently generate THz radiation in a broad range of frequencies following optical excitation. Here, we investigate a pyroelectric material, ZnSnN2, and find that above-band-gap excitation results in the efficient formation of an ultrafast photocurrent generating THz radiation. The resulting THz electric field spans a frequency range from below 1 to above 30 THz. Our results suggest that the photocurrent is primarily driven by an ultrafast pyroelectric effect where the photo-excited carriers screen the spontaneous electric polarization of ZnSnN2. Strong structural disorder reduces the photocarrier lifetime significantly and, thus, enables broadband operation. ZnSnN2 shows similar THz-emitter performance as the best spintronic THz emitters regarding bandwidth and amplitude. Our study unveils the large potential of pyroelectric materials as efficient and broadband THz emitters with built-in bias fields.</description>

      <title>A core-sensitive mixed $f$/$g$ mode of the Sun predicted by wave topology and hydrodynamical simulation</title>

Abstract: Helioseismology has revolutionized our understanding of the Sun by analyzing its global oscillation modes. However, the solar core remains elusive, limiting a full understanding of its evolution. In this work, we study a previously unnoticed global oscillation mode of the Sun using a fully compressible, hydrodynamical simulation of the solar interior, and assess that it is a mixed $f$/$g$ mode with a period of about one hour. This is the first global stellar hydrodynamics simulation that successfuly couple compressible and gravity modes. To understand this coupling, we invoke a recent theory on the nature of $f$-modes seen through the prism of wave topology, characterizing their ability to propagate deep into stellar interiors. We demonstrate that the mixed $f$/$g$ mode is highly sensitive to the core's rotation rate, providing a new promising pathway to explore the Sun's core.</description>

      <title>Real-time adaptive tracking of fluctuating relaxation rates in superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is ultimately bounded by decoherence effects induced by a fluctuating environment. Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of experimental protocols limits the precision with which the environment can be measured and may obscure the detailed structure of these fluctuations. Here we present a real-time Bayesian method for estimating the relaxation rate of a qubit, leveraging a classical controller with an integrated field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Using our FPGA-powered Bayesian method, we adaptively and continuously track the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. Our technique allows for the estimation of these relaxation times in a few milliseconds, more than two orders of magnitude faster than previous nonadaptive methods, and allows us to observe fluctuations up to 5 times the qubit's average relaxation rates on significantly shorter timescales than previously reported. Our statistical analysis reveals that these fluctuations occur on much faster timescales than previously understood, with two-level-system switching rates reaching up to 10 Hz. Our work offers an appealing solution for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening and for improved understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is a strong and readily accessible optical nonlinearity enabling a wide array of applications and research directions. For instance, the three-wave mixing process has been employed to great success for narrow-linewidth lasers, sensing applications, microscopy, and signal processing. While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation, there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering mechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in standard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with microscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which has not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic scattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS interaction. This work provides a foundation for a wide range of applications and further research including sensing applications, new approaches to investigate TLS physics, and Brillouin-scattering-based quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>Type III Valley Polarization and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Two-Dimensional Non-Janus and Janus Altermagnet Fe2WS2Se2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the valley degree of freedom introduces a novel paradigm for advancing quantum information technology. Currently, the investigation on spontaneous valley polarization mainly focuses on two major types of systems. One type magnetic systems by breaking the time-reversal symmetry, the other is ferroelectric materials through breaking the inversion symmetry. Might there be additional scenarios? Here, we propose to realize spontaneous valley polarization by breaking the mirror symmetry in the altermagnets, named type III valley polarization. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we confirm that this mechanism is feasible in Non-Janus Fe2WS2Se2. Monolayer Non-Janus and Janus Fe2WS2Se2 are stable Neel-type antiferromagnetic state with the direct band gap semiconductor. More interestingly, their magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits the rare biaxial anisotropy and a four-leaf clover shape in the xy plane, while the xz and yz planes show the common uniaxial anisotropy. This originated from the fourth-order single ion interactions. More importantly, the valley splitting is spontaneously generated in the Non-Janus Fe2WS2Se2 due to the Mxy symmetry breaking, without requiring the SOC effect. Both the Non-Janus and Janus Fe2WS2Se2 exhibit diverse valley polarization and anomalous valley Hall effect properties. In addition, the magnitude and direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the biaxial strain and magnetic field. Our findings not only expand the realization system of spontaneous valley polarization, but also provide a theoretical basis for the high-density storage of valley degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Single Cu Atom Sites on Co3O4 Activate Interfacial Oxygen for Enhanced Reactivity and Selective Gas Sensing at Low Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the redox landscape of transition metal oxides is central to advancing their reactivity for heterogeneous catalysis or high-performance gas sensing. Here we report single Cu atom sites (1.42 wt%) anchored on Co3O4 nanoparticles (Cu1-Co3O4) that dramatically enhance reactivity and molecular sensing properties of the support at low temperature. The Cu1 are identified by X-ray adsorption near edge structure and feature strong metal-support interaction between Cu2+ and Co3O4, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The ability of Cu1 to form interfacial Cu-O-Co linkages strongly reduces the temperature of lattice oxygen activation compared to CuO nanoparticles on Co3O4 (CuONP-Co3O4), as demonstrated by temperature-programmed reduction and desorption analyses. To demonstrate immediate practical impact, we deploy such Cu1-Co3O4 nanoparticles as chemoresistive sensor for formaldehyde vapor that yields more than an order of magnitude higher response than CuONP-Co3O4 and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sensors. That way, formaldehyde is detected down to 5 parts-per-billion at 50% relative humidity and 75 {\deg}C with excellent selectivity over various critical interferents. These results establish a mechanistic platform for activating redox-active supports using single-atom isolates of non-noble nature that yield drastically enhanced and well-defined reactivity to promote low-temperature oxidation reactions and selective analyte sensing.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we consider the effect of Radon or X-ray transformations, on the Laplace eigenfunctions in hyperbolic Bolyai-Lobachevsky space. We show that the Radon map from this space to Lorentzian-signature Anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space is easier to interpret if we use the Poincare disc model and eigenfunctions rather than the upper-half-plane model. In particular, this version of the transform reveals the geometric origin of the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions that are involved in calculating the SYK four-point function.</description>

      <title>A Diffuse-Interface Marangoni Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel Marangoni-induced instability that arises exclusively in diffuse fluid interfaces, absent in classical sharp-interface models. Using a validated phase-field Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn framework, we linearize the governing equations to analyze the onset and development of interfacial instability driven by solute-induced surface tension gradients. A critical interfacial thickness scaling inversely with the Marangoni number, $\delta_\mathrm{cr} \sim Ma^{-1}$, emerges from the balance between advective and diffusive transport. Unlike sharp-interface scenarios where matched viscosity and diffusivity stabilize the interface, finite thickness induces asymmetric solute distributions and tangential velocity shifts that destabilize the system. We identify universal power-law scalings of velocity and concentration offsets with a modified Marangoni number $Ma^\delta$, independent of capillary number and interfacial mobility. A critical crossover at $Ma^\delta \approx 590$ distinguishes diffusion-dominated stabilization from advection-driven destabilization. These findings highlight the importance of diffuse-interface effects in multiphase flows, with implications for miscible fluids, soft matter, and microfluidics where interfacial thickness and coupled transport phenomena are non-negligible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of beta-tantalum, a ``bad" metal whose electronic properties are inconsistent with the Fermi liquid theory. Fano factors cluster around even multiples of the values expected for Fermi liquids, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated charge liquid of Cooper pair-like electron groups. Further evidence for correlations is provided by the effects of magnetic impurities, as well as reduced density of states near the Fermi level indicated by point contact spectroscopy and first principles calculations. Our results open new avenues for studies and applications of electron correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian band structures, exceptional points generically form gapless lines or loops that give rise to extensively many defective eigenstates. In this work, we investigate how they nontrivially contribute to higher-order nonlinear responses by introducing unique singularities in the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) or Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Using a tilted two-dimensional dissipative Dirac model ansatz that harbors an exceptional ring, broken inversion symmetry is shown to give rise to extrinsic (BCD) and intrinsic (BCP) nonlinear Hall behaviors unique to systems with extensive exceptional singularities. In particular, when the non-Hermiticity is increased while keeping the ring radius fixed, the BCD response exhibits a power-law increase, while the BCP response correspondingly decreases. Our work sheds light on how non-Hermiticity can qualitatively control the extent and nature of higher harmonic generation in solids.</description>

      <title>Evidence of orbital Hall current induced correlation in second harmonic response of longitudinal and transverse voltage in light metal-ferromagnet bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of orbital current arising from orbital Hall effect in thin films of Nb and Ti in ohmic contact with ferromagnetic Ni in the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltages in response to an a.c. current applied to the bilayer structures. Our experiments were analogous to those on Heavy Metal-Ferromagnet bilayers and we extract the Orbital Hall Torque efficiency and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect and critical currents in trivial and topological full-shell hybrid nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform microscopic numerical simulations of the Josephson effect through short junctions between two full-shell hybrid nanowires, comprised of a semiconductor core fully wrapped by a thin superconductor shell, both in the trivial and topological regimes. We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current $I_c$ as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that $I_c$ is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within non-zero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in $I_c$ as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and hole-like character produces steps and dips in $I_c$. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, $\pi$- and $\phi$-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.</description>

      <title>Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent development of altermagnetic materials, supporting spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics that are fundamentally distinct from conventional ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or spin-orbit coupling systems. Here we investigate spin-selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. We focus on two types of $d$-wave altermagnets, namely, weak and strong altermagnets that support close elliptic and open hyperbolic spin-resolved Fermi surfaces, respectively. Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Spin-split superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled hybrid nanowires with ferromagnetic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report transport studies of hybrid Josephson junctions based on semiconducting InAs nanowires with fully overlapping epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator EuS and superconducting Al partial shells. Current-biased measurements reveal a hysteretic superconducting window with a sizable supercurrent near the coercive field of the ferromagnetic insulator, accompanied by multiple Andreev reflections. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a superconducting gap characterized by three peaks, which we attribute to tunneling between exchange-split superconductors. A theoretical model reproduces the observed features and indicates that spin mixing, driven by sizable spin-orbit coupling, is essential to their formation. Our results demonstrate proximity-induced superconductivity through a ferromagnetic insulator and establish a new platform for exploring spin-triplet pairing.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast interband transitions in nanoporous gold metamaterial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals have emerged as promising functional architectures due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, high surface areas, and versatile use in real-life applications such as sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. While the optical and morphological properties of nanoporous metals have been extensively studied, their electronic properties at ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. Here, we study the transient response of a nanoporous gold metamaterial and compare it with the ultrafast dynamics of a continuous gold film. We unravel that the nanoporous sample supports lower energy interband transitions, due to a much higher electron temperature in the nanoporous material, which causes an enhanced redistribution of electron density around the Fermi level. The experimental results are consistent with the two-temperature model, which highlights the role of nanoscale porosity in enabling the more efficient generation of hot carriers, thus allowing lower energy photons to induce interband transitions. Our findings demonstrate that nanoporosity affects fundamental ultrafast electronic processes and introduces this platform as temporal metamaterial allowing the emergence of tunable electronic properties not supported by the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, we present new insights into ultrafast electronic properties of nanoporous metals, which can impact several areas, from photochemistry and catalysis to energy harvesting and opto-electronics.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of the topological obstruction in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) results from the Coulomb interactions of electrons in flat bands of non-trivial topology. While the bands' dispersion is well characterized, accessing their topology remains an experimental challenge. Recent measurements established the local density of states (LDOS) as a topological observable. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to investigate the LDOS of TBG near a defect. We observe characteristic patterns resulting from the Dirac cones having the same chirality within a moir\'e valley. At higher energies, we observe the Lifshitz transition associated with the Dirac cones mixing. Our measurements provide a full characterization of TBG's band structure, confirming the main features of the continuum model including the renormalization of the Fermi velocity, the role of emergent symmetries and the topological obstruction of the wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Coherence Across the Brillouin Lasing Threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is one of the most accessible nonlinear optical phenomena and has been widely studied since its theoretical discovery one hundred years ago. The scattering mechanism is a three-wave-mixing process between two optical fields and one acoustic field and has found a broad range of applications spanning microscopy to ultra-narrow-linewidth lasers. Building on the success of utilizing this nonlinearity at a classical level, a rich avenue is now being opened to explore Brillouin scattering within the paradigm of quantum optics. Here, we take a key step in this direction by employing quantum optical techniques yet to be utilized for Brillouin scattering to characterize the second-order coherence of Stokes scattering across the Brillouin lasing threshold. We use a silica microsphere resonator and single-photon counters to observe the expected transition from bunched statistics of thermal light below the lasing threshold to Poissonian statistics of coherent light above the threshold. Notably, at powers approaching the lasing threshold, we also observe super-thermal statistics, which arise due to instability and a "flickering" in and out of lasing as the pump field is transiently depleted. The statistics observed across the transition, including the "flickering", are a result of the full nonlinear three-wave-mixing process and cannot be captured by a linearized model. These measurements are in good agreement with numerical solutions of the three-wave Langevin equations and are well demarcated by analytical expressions for the instability and the lasing thresholds. These results demonstrate that applying second-order-coherence and photon-counting measurements to Brillouin scattering provides new methods to advance our understanding of Brillouin scattering itself and progress toward quantum-state preparation and characterization of acoustic modes.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Landau-level composition of bound exciton states in magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.</description>

      <title>Metrological symmetries in singular quantum multi-parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical foundation of quantum sensing is rooted in the Cram\'er-Rao formalism, which establishes quantitative precision bounds for a given quantum probe. In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the multi-parameter Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) applies. Since this is a matrix inequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parametrization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cram\'er-Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.</description>

      <title>Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts temporarily degrade qubit coherence which can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allowed us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of a few. This reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</description>
