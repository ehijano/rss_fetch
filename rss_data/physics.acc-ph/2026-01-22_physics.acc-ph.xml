      <title>Two-port CW measurements on RF cavities: Notes on self-consistency assessment and indirect methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the case of a radio-frequency (RF) cavity with a mismatched input coupler, a direct calculation of the power dissipation in the cavity and the intrinsic quality factor from continuous-wave (CW) measurements may have uncertainty due to systematic errors. Formulae for an indirect calculation of these quantities are derived for the case of a cavity with two couplers of fixed coupling strength. In this approach, the signal from the pickup coupler is used to infer the amplitude of the "emitted wave" from the input coupler. A graphical method for self-consistency assessment is evaluated. The impact of frequency offsets is considered. Applications of these methods are presented, drawing on cold tests of superconducting cavities produced for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nitrogen and Oxygen Interstitials on Niobium SRF Cavity Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on 1.3 GHz niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at 16 MV/m. We also observe an additive effect of O and N impurities in reducing R$_\mathrm{T}$. We discuss these results in the context of field dependent nonequilibrium superconductivity, gap enhancement, and hydrogen trapping mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a novel phase space painting method in a coupled lattice to mitigate space charge in high-intensity hadron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-turn charge-exchange injection is the primary method of creating high-intensity hadron beams in circular accelerators, and phase space painting during injection enables tailoring of the accumulated phase space distribution. A technique we call eigenpainting allows injection of particles into a single mode of a coupled ring, providing full four-dimensional control of the phase space distribution. Under ideal conditions, uniform eigenpainting generates a linear-force equilibrium distribution in the transverse plane, with zero volume in four-dimensional transverse phase space, even including space charge. We have implemented eigenpainting for the first time in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Accumulator Ring. Injecting 8.8 $\mu$C of 800 MeV beam, we obtain a final ratio of intrinsic transverse emittances of $\approx$2.4. We analyze the effect of space charge on the final distribution through comparison of the reconstructed phase space to particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>An analytical optimization of plasma density profiles for downramp injection in laser wake-field acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and detail a multi-step analytical procedure, based on an improved fully relativistic plane model for Laser Wake Field Acceleration, to tailor the initial density of a cold diluted plasma to the laser pulse profile, so as to control and optimize the partial wave-breaking of the plasma wave and maximize the acceleration of small bunches of electrons self-injected by the first wave-breaking at the density down-ramp, at least in the first stages of their acceleration phase. We find an excellent agreement with the results of Particle In Cell simulations obtained with the same input data.</description>
