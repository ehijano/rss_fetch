      <title>Eco-Innovation and Earnings Management: Unveiling the Moderating Effects of Financial Constraints and Opacity in FTSE All-Share Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our research investigates the relationship between eco-innovation and earnings management among 567 firms listed on the FTSE All-Share Index from 2014 to 2022. By examining how sustainability-driven innovation influences financial reporting practices, we explore the strategic motivations behind income smoothing in firms engaged in environmental initiatives. The findings reveal a positive association between eco-innovation and earnings management, suggesting that firms may leverage ecoinnovation not only for environmental signalling but also to project financial stability and meet stakeholder expectations. The analysis further uncovers that the propensity for earnings management is amplified in firms facing financial constraints, proxied by low Whited-Wu (WW) scores and weak sales performance, and in those characterised by high financial opacity. We employ a robust multi-method approach to address potential endogeneity and selection bias, including entropy balancing, propensity score matching (PSM), and the Heckman Test correction. Our research contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the dual strategic role of ecoinnovation -balancing sustainability signalling with earnings management, under varying financial conditions. The findings offer actionable insights for regulators, investors, and policymakers navigating the intersection of corporate transparency, financial health, and environmental responsibility.</description>

      <title>Estimating the spatial economic and environmental impact of planned offshore wind energy in the USA using Environmentally Extended Multiregional Input-Output analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a projected increase in offshore wind energy generation in the United States over the next three decades, driven by legislative commitments and government funding. Like other renewable technologies, the construction of offshore wind farms has environmental impacts and spillover effects that must be assessed. Developing offshore wind as a reliable domestic energy source requires a multiregional analysis of economic and environmental effects of constructing projects along lakefronts and coastal regions. Although no commercial offshore wind farms currently operate in the United States, seven states have announced capacity commitments exceeding 28 gigawatts by 2035. This study evaluates the spatial economic and environmental impacts of planned projects by linking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Offshore Renewables Balance-of-system Installation Tool (ORBIT) with a multiregional input-output model of the U.S. economy developed in the Virtual Industrial Ecology Lab. ORBIT provides capital investment requirements for installation, which are combined with the model to estimate economic spillover effects. Environmental impacts are assessed using a newly developed multiregional greenhouse gas emissions dataset for the U.S. to capture supply chain emissions of offshore wind construction. The five projects analyzed require 16.3 billion dollars in capital investment and generate 27.6 billion dollars in direct and indirect economic impacts across the country. Emissions results show that states active in energy generation are most affected, but impacts can be reduced by decarbonizing the grid. A carbon payback analysis indicates the projects offset construction-phase emissions in less than a year. The framework highlights which states experience the greatest spillover effects in terms of emissions and economic activity required to support offshore wind expansion.</description>

      <title>Intergenerational Mobility Trends and the Changing Role of Female Labor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using harmonized administrative data from Scandinavia, we find that intergenerational rank associations in income have increased uniformly across Sweden, Denmark, and Norway for cohorts born between 1951 and 1979. By gender, father-son mobility remains stable, while correlations for mothers and daughters rise. Similar patterns appear in US survey data, albeit with different timing. We show that the decline in income mobility reflects female income more accurately capturing underlying productivity, rather than stronger intergenerational transmission of human capital or changes in assortative mating. Finally, we show parent-child correlations increase mainly when women gain access to jobs that match their productivity.</description>

      <title>How Transit Countries Become Refugee Destinations: Insights from Central and Eastern Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores how refugees' destination preferences evolve during transit, with a focus on Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Romania. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyse data from the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Flow Monitoring Surveys and complement it with qualitative insights from focus group discussions with refugees. The quantitative analysis reveals that refugees' preferences for destination countries often change during transit, influenced by factors such as safety concerns, asylum conditions, education, and the presence of relatives at the destination. Our results support the application of bounded rationality and human capital theory, showing that while economic opportunities are important, safety becomes the dominant concern during transit. The qualitative analysis adds depth to these findings, highlighting the role of political instability, social networks, and economic hardships as initial migration drivers. Additionally, the study reveals how refugees reassess their destination choices based on their experiences in transit countries, with Romania emerging as a viable settlement destination due to its relative stability and access to asylum procedures. This research contributes to migration studies by challenging the traditional view of transit countries and offering new insights into the fluid nature of refugee decision-making.</description>

      <title>Potato Potahto in the FAO-GAEZ Productivity Measures? Nonclassical Measurement Error with Multiple Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FAO-GAEZ productivity data are widely used in Economics. However, the empirical literature rarely discusses measurement error. We use two proxies to derive novel analytical bounds around the effect of agricultural productivity in a setting with nonclassical measurement error. These bounds rely on assumptions that are weaker than the ones imposed in empirical studies and exhaust the information contained in the first two moments of the data. We reevaluate three influential studies, documenting that measurement error matters and that the impact of agricultural productivity may be smaller than previously reported. Our methodology has broad applications in empirical research involving mismeasured variables.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Welfare Content of International Price and Income Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilateral index numbers, such as those used to make cross-country comparisons of prices and income, are fundamental objects in economics. However, these numbers can be challenging to interpret in terms of welfare due to a bias related to preference misspecification. To study this problem, I derive multilateral bounds on the cost of living implied by revealed preference. The bounds improve upon their classical bilateral counterparts, permit a benchmark-free appraisal of comparison methods, and define a novel index that is transitive, welfare-consistent, and which incorporates income effects. In an appraisal application I find support for the welfare-interpretability of many contemporary index methods, but not for market exchange rates. Turning to the end uses of cross-country comparisons themselves, I document that when calculated using an index based on the multilateral cost of living, the world in 2017 was substantially larger and more equal vis-\`a-vis the United States than suggested by conventional measures.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Trader Responses to Macroeconomic Surprises: Simulating Order Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how market participants react to shocks like scheduled macroeconomic news is crucial for both traders and policymakers. We develop a calibrated data generation process DGP that embeds four stylized trader archetypes retail, pension, institutional, and hedge funds into an extended CAPM augmented by CPI surprises. Each agents order size choice is driven by a softmax discrete choice rule over small, medium, and large trades, where utility depends on risk aversion, surprise magnitude, and liquidity. We aim to analyze each agent's reaction to shocks and Monte Carlo experiments show that higher information, lower aversion agents take systematically larger positions and achieve higher average wealth. Retail investors under react on average, exhibiting smaller allocations and more dispersed outcomes. And ambient liquidity amplifies the sensitivity of order flow to surprise shocks. Our framework offers a transparent benchmark for analyzing order flow dynamics around macro releases and suggests how real time flow data could inform news impact inference.</description>

      <title>Assignment at the Frontier: Identifying the Frontier Structural Function and Bounding Mean Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a model in which an outcome equals a frontier function of inputs minus a nonnegative unobserved deviation. We allow the deviation's distribution to depend on inputs, thereby allowing for endogeneity. If zero lies in the support of the deviation given inputs -- an assumption we term assignment at the frontier -- then the frontier is identified by the supremum of the outcome at those inputs, obviating the need for instrumental variables. We then estimate the frontier, allowing for random error whose distribution may also depend on inputs. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the mean deviation, using only variance and skewness, that is robust to a scarcity of data near the frontier. We apply our methods to estimate a firm-level frontier production function and inefficiency.</description>
