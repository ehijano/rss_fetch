      <title>Combinatorics of higher-categorical diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a book on higher-categorical diagrams, including pasting diagrams. It aims to provide a thorough and modern reference on the subject, collecting, revisiting and expanding results scattered across the literature, informed by recent advances and practical experience with higher-dimensional diagram rewriting.
  We approach the subject as a kind of directed combinatorial topology: a diagram is a map from a "directed cell complex", encoded combinatorially as a face poset together with orientation data. Unlike previous expositions, we adopt from the beginning a functorial viewpoint, focussing on morphisms and categorical constructions. We do not tie ourselves to a specific model of higher categories, and instead treat diagrams as independent combinatorial structures that admit functorial interpretations in various contexts.
  Topics covered include the theory of layerings of diagrams; acyclicity properties and their consequences; constructions including Gray products, suspensions, and joins; special shapes such as globes, oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes; the interpretation of diagrams in strict omega-categories and their geometric realisation as simplicial and CW complexes; and Steiner's theory of directed chain complexes.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology with DG Coefficients. Applications to cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define Hamiltonian Floer homology with differential graded (DG) local coefficients for symplectically aspherical manifolds. The differential of the underlying complex involves chain representatives of the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Floer trajectories of arbitrary dimension. This setup allows in particular to define and compute Floer homology with coefficients in chains on fibers of fibrations over the free loop space of the underlying symplectic manifold. We develop the DG Floer toolset, including continuation maps and homotopies, and we also define and study symplectic homology groups with DG local coefficients. We define spectral invariants and establish general criteria for almost existence of contractible periodic orbits on regular energy levels of Hamiltonian systems inside Liouville domains.
  In the case of cotangent bundles, we prove a Viterbo isomorphism theorem with DG local coefficients. This serves as a stepping stone for applications to the almost existence of contractible closed characteristics on closed smooth hypersurfaces. In this context, our methods allow to access for the first time the dichotomy between closed manifolds that are aspherical and those that are not.</description>

      <title>Generalized maps between diffeological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By utilizing the idea of Colombeau's generalized function, we introduce a notion of asymptotic map between arbitrary diffeological spaces. The category consisting of diffeological spaces and asymptotic maps is enriched over the category of diffeological spaces, and inherits completeness and cocompleteness. In particular, the set of asymptotic functions on a Euclidean open set include Schwartz distributions and form a Colombeau type smooth differential algebra over Robinson's field of asymptotic numbers. To illustrate the usefulness of our machinery, we show that homotopy extension property can be established for smooth relative cell complexes if we exploit asymptotic maps instead of smooth ones.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard diffeology and generalized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonstandard extension of the category of diffeological spaces, and demonstrate its application to the study of generalized functions. Just as diffeological spaces are defined as concrete sheaves on the site of Euclidean open sets, our nonstandard diffeological spaces are defined as concrete sheaves on the site of open subsets of nonstandard Euclidean spaces, i.e. finite dimensional vector spaces over (the quasi-asymptotic variant of) Robinson's hyperreal numbers. It is shown that nonstandard diffeological spaces form a category which is enriched over the category of diffeological spaces, is closed under small limits and colimits, and is cartesian closed. Furthermore, it can be shown that the space of nonstandard functions on the extension of a Euclidean open set is a smooth differential algebra that admits an embedding of the differential vector space of Schwartz distributions. Since our algebra of generalized functions comes as a hom-object in a category, it enables not only the multiplication of distributions but also the composition of them. To illustrate the usefulness of this property we show that the homotopy extension property can be established for smooth relative cell complexes by exploiting extended maps.</description>

      <title>The Total Rank Conjecture in Characteristic Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Total Rank Conjecture is a coarser version of the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud-Horrocks conjecture which, loosely stated, predicts that modules with large annihilators must also have ``large'' syzygies. This conjecture was proved by the second author for rings of odd characteristic by taking advantage of the Adams operations on the category of perfect complexes with finite length homology. In this paper, we prove a stronger form of the Total Rank Conjecture for rings of characteristic two. This result may be seen as evidence that the Generalized Total Rank Conjecture (which is known to be false in odd characteristic) actually holds in characteristic two. We also formulate a meaningful extension of the Total Rank Conjecture over non Cohen-Macaulay rings and prove that this conjecture holds for any ring containing a field (independent of characteristic).</description>

      <title>Swap cosystolic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study swap cosystolic expansion, a new expansion property of simplicial complexes. We prove lower bounds for swap coboundary expansion of spherical buildings and use them to lower bound swap cosystolic expansion of the LSV Ramanujan complexes. Our motivation is the recent work (in a companion paper) showing that swap cosystolic expansion implies agreement theorems. Together the two works show that these complexes support agreement tests in the low acceptance regime.
  Swap cosystolic expansion is defined by considering, for a given complex $X$, its faces complex $F^r X$, whose vertices are $r$-faces of $X$ and where two vertices are connected if their disjoint union is also a face in $X$. The faces complex $F^r X$ is a derandomizetion of the product of $X$ with itself $r$ times. The graph underlying $F^rX$ is the swap walk of $X$, known to have excellent spectral expansion. The swap cosystolic expansion of $X$ is defined to be the cosystolic expansion of $F^r X$.
  Our main result is a $\exp(-O(\sqrt r))$ lower bound on the swap coboundary expansion of the spherical building and the swap cosystolic expansion of the LSV complexes. For more general coboundary expanders we show a weaker lower bound of $exp(-O(r))$.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

      <title>Box Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new framework that unifies the filtration and mapper approaches from TDA, and present efficient algorithms to compute it. Termed the box filtration of a PCD, we grow boxes (hyperrectangles) that are not necessarily centered at each point (in place of balls centered at points). We grow the boxes non-uniformly and asymmetrically in different dimensions based on the distribution of points. We present two approaches to handle the boxes: a point cover where each point is assigned its own box at start, and a pixel cover that works with a pixelization of the space of the PCD. Any box cover in either setting automatically gives a mapper of the PCD. We show that the persistence diagrams generated by the box filtration using both point and pixel covers satisfy the classical stability based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Using boxes also implies that the box filtration is identical for pairwise or higher order intersections whereas the VR and Cech filtration are not the same.
  Growth in each dimension is computed by solving a linear program (LP) that optimizes a cost functional balancing the cost of expansion and benefit of including more points in the box. The box filtration algorithm runs in $O(m|U(0)|\log(mn\pi)L(q))$ time, where $m$ is number of steps of increments considered for box growth, $|U(0)|$ is the number of boxes in the initial cover ($\leq$ number of points), $\pi$ is the step length for increasing each box dimension, each LP is solved in $O(L(q))$ time, $n$ is the PCD dimension, and $q = n \times |X|$. We demonstrate through multiple examples that the box filtration can produce more accurate results to summarize the topology of the PCD than VR and distance-to-measure (DTM) filtrations. Software for our implementation is available at https://github.com/pragup/Box-Filteration.</description>
