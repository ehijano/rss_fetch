      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of an Influenza A (H1N1) Model with Treatment and Vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the modeling, mathematical analysis, developing theories, and numerical simulation of Influenza virus transmission. We have proved the existence, uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness of the solutions. Also, investigate the qualitative behavior of the models and find the basic reproduction number $(\mathcal{R}_0)$ that guarantees the asymptotic stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The local and global asymptotic stability of the disease free state and endemic equilibrium of the system is analyzed with the Lyapunov method, Routh-Hurwitz, and other criteria and presented graphically. This study helps to investigate the effectiveness of control policy and makes suggestions for alternative control policies. Bifurcation analyses are carried out to determine prevention strategies. Transcritical, Hopf, and backward bifurcation analyses are displayed analytically and numerically to show the dynamics of disease transmission in different cases. Moreover, analysis of contour plot, box plot, relative biases, phase portraits are presented to show the influential parameters to curtail the disease outbreak. We are interested in finding the nature of $\mathcal{R}_0$, which determines whether the disease dies out or persists in the population. The findings indicate that the dynamics of the model are determined by the threshold parameter $\mathcal{R}_0$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic compartment model with mortality and its application to epidemic spreading in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study epidemic spreading in complex networks by a multiple random walker approach. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a complex undirected (ergodic) random graph where we focus on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA), Erd\"os-R\'enyi (ER) and Watts-Strogatz (WS) types. Both, walkers and nodes can be either susceptible (S) or infected and infectious (I) representing their states of health. Susceptible nodes may be infected by visits of infected walkers, and susceptible walkers may be infected by visiting infected nodes. No direct transmission of the disease among walkers (or among nodes) is possible. This model mimics a large class of diseases such as Dengue and Malaria with transmission of the disease via vectors (mosquitos). Infected walkers may die during the time span of their infection introducing an additional compartment D of dead walkers. Infected nodes never die and always recover from their infection after a random finite time. We derive stochastic evolution equations for the mean-field compartmental populations with mortality of walkers and delayed transitions among the compartments. From linear stability analysis, we derive the basic reproduction numbers R M , R 0 with and without mortality, respectively, and prove that R M &lt; R 0 . For R M , R 0 &gt; 1 the healthy state is unstable whereas for zero mortality a stable endemic equilibrium exists (independent of the initial conditions) which we obtained explicitly. We observe that the solutions of the random walk simulations in the considered networks agree well with the mean-field solutions for strongly connected graph topologies, whereas less well for weakly connected structures and for diseases with high mortality.</description>

      <title>Beyond May: Complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is not supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological systems are large, complex -- and, by and large, stable. In this paper, we revisit May's argument in the light of recent developments in both ecology and random matrix theory. Using a non-linear generalization of the Lotka-Volterra model, we show that there are in fact two kinds of complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is stabilizing. Our result shows that May's principle that "complexity begets instability" is not a general property of complex systems; instead, it is a property of a subclass of weakly cross-regulated disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Combining mutation and recombination statistics to infer clonal families in antibody repertoires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: B-cell repertoires are characterized by a diverse set of receptors of distinct specificities generated through two processes of somatic diversification: V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutations. B cell clonal families stem from the same V(D)J recombination event, but differ in their hypermutations. Clonal families identification is key to understanding B-cell repertoire function, evolution and dynamics. We present HILARy (High-precision Inference of Lineages in Antibody Repertoires), an efficient, fast and precise method to identify clonal families from single- or paired-chain repertoire sequencing datasets. HILARy combines probabilistic models that capture the receptor generation and selection statistics with adapted clustering methods to achieve consistently high inference accuracy. It automatically leverages the phylogenetic signal of shared mutations in difficult repertoire subsets. Exploiting the high sensitivity of the method, we find the statistics of evolutionary properties such as the site frequency spectrum and dN/dS ratio do not depend on the junction length. We also identify a broad range of selection pressures spanning two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The weighted total cophenetic index: A novel balance index for phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks play an important role in evolutionary biology as, other than phylogenetic trees, they can be used to accommodate reticulate evolutionary events such as horizontal gene transfer and hybridization. Recent research has provided a lot of progress concerning the reconstruction of such networks from data as well as insight into their graph theoretical properties. However, methods and tools to quantify structural properties of networks or differences between them are still very limited. For example, for phylogenetic trees, it is common to use balance indices to draw conclusions concerning the underlying evolutionary model, and more than twenty such indices have been proposed and are used for different purposes. One of the most frequently used balance index for trees is the so-called total cophenetic index, which has several mathematically and biologically desirable properties. For networks, on the other hand, balance indices are to-date still scarce.
  In this contribution, we introduce the \textit{weighted} total cophenetic index as a generalization of the total cophenetic index for trees to make it applicable to general phylogenetic networks. As we shall see, this index can be determined efficiently and behaves in a mathematical sound way, i.e., it satisfies so-called locality and recursiveness conditions. In addition, we analyze its extremal properties and, in particular, we investigate its maxima and minima as well as the structure of networks that achieve these values within the space of so-called level-$1$ networks. We finally briefly compare this novel index to the two other network balance indices available so-far.</description>

      <title>Runtime Analysis of Competitive co-Evolutionary Algorithms for Maximin Optimisation of a Bilinear Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Co-evolutionary algorithms have a wide range of applications, such as in hardware design, evolution of strategies for board games, and patching software bugs. However, these algorithms are poorly understood and applications are often limited by pathological behaviour, such as loss of gradient, relative over-generalisation, and mediocre objective stasis. It is an open challenge to develop a theory that can predict when co-evolutionary algorithms find solutions efficiently and reliable.
  This paper provides a first step in developing runtime analysis for population-based competitive co-evolutionary algorithms. We provide a mathematical framework for describing and reasoning about the performance of co-evolutionary processes. An example application of the framework shows a scenario where a simple co-evolutionary algorithm obtains a solution in polynomial expected time. Finally, we describe settings where the co-evolutionary algorithm needs exponential time with overwhelmingly high probability to obtain a solution.</description>
