      <title>Fast and Accurate Charge Transfer Excitations via Nested Aufbau Suppressed Coupled Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling charge transfer well can require treating post-excitation orbital relaxations and handling medium to large molecules in realistic environments. By combining a state-specific correlation treatment with such orbital relaxations, Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster has proven accurate for charge transfer, but, like many coupled cluster methods, it struggles with large system sizes. We derive a low-cost Aufbau suppressed second order perturbation theory and show that, by nesting a small coupled cluster treatment inside of it, computational cost and scaling are reduced while accuracy is maintained. Formal asymptotic costs are dropped from iterative $N^6$ to non-iterative $N^5$ plus iterative $N^3$, and we test an initial implementation that can handle about 100 atoms and 800 orbitals on a single computational node. Charge transfer excitation energy errors are below 0.1 eV on average, a 0.25 eV improvement over $N^6$-cost equation of motion coupled cluster with singles and doubles.</description>

      <title>Quantum propagation scheme using Hagedorn wave packets : numerical developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we provide a novel wave packet propagation method that generalizes the Hagedorn approach by introducing alternative primitive basis sets that are better suited to describe different physical processes. More precisely, in our propagation scheme, we can mix basis sets with time-dependent parameters (the Hagedorn basis set) and time-independent ones, such as Fourier series, particle-in-a-box, or harmonic oscillator basis sets. Furthermore, our implementation can handle models with several electronic states, so that non-adiabatic processes can be studied. Instead of the time-dependent variational principle, our propagation scheme uses a three-step procedure (standard propagation, time-dependent parameter evaluation, and projection). It relies on multidimensional integrations, which are performed numerically with Gaussian quadrature, so that we have no constraints on the for of the Hamiltonian operator. This numerical algorithm has been implemented in a modern Fortran code available on GitHub (https://github.com/asodoga/TD_Schrod_Rabiou).
  The code has been tested and validated by comparisons with standard propagation schemes on 2D-models with harmonic and anharmonic potentials (modified H\'enon-Heiles). More precisely, our benchmark tests show that the wave packets obtained with our propagation scheme are able to converge to exact wave packets (obtained from standard propagation techniques). Finally, we have applied our method to compute the vibrational spectrum of the 6D-modified H\'enon-Heiles model and we show that our scheme reproduces well the results obtained with the standard approach and with smaller basis functions. As a perspective, we show that with the generalized Hagedorn wave packet method, we are able to study the non-adiabtic dynamics of the cis-trans retinal isomerization in a reduced 2D-model with two coupled electronic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Spin-Flip TDDFT with Noncollinear Kernels and Its Application on Low-Lying Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) employing a noncollinear kernel constitutes a promising methodology for the characterization of electronic states within complex molecular systems. In the present study, we examine three challenging practical scenarios: (1) States that are mainly dominated by a double excitation configuration, where spin-conserving TDDFT can't reach double excitation configurations due to its single excitation nature; (2) Singlet ground states that are contributed by multi-configurations in singlet diradicals and diradicaloids, where DFT meets difficulties due to its single determinant nature; (3) Inverted energy gap between the first singlet excited state and the lowest triplet state when Hund's rule is violated, which is experimentally found in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules. Spin-conserving TDDFT has been shown to fail in such a situation. Notably, we can predict the inverted energy gap in TADF molecules with GGA, mGGA and hybrid functionals. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of spin-flip TDDFT when applied to these demanding contexts. Furthermore, we elucidate the nature of the electronic configurations underpinning these phenomena, which can facilitate further advancements in the development of these functional molecules.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic reactive scattering of hydrogen on different surface facets of copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissociative chemisorption is a key process in hydrogen-metal surface chemistry, where nonadiabatic effects due to low-lying electron-hole-pair excitations may affect reaction outcomes. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations can capture weak nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, but require as input energy landscapes and electronic friction tensors. Here, we present full-dimensional machine learning surrogate models of the electronic friction tensor to study reactive hydrogen chemistry at the low-index surface facets Cu(100), Cu(110), Cu(111), and Cu(211). We combine these surrogate models with machine learning interatomic potentials to simulate quantum-state-resolved H$_2$ reactive scattering on pristine copper surfaces. The predicted sticking coefficient and survival probabilities are in excellent agreement with experiment. Comparison between adiabatic and nonadiabatic simulations reveals that the influence of electron-hole pair excitations on the scattering dynamics is weak and that the probability for dissociative adsorption is dominated by the shape of the underlying potential energy surface and the initial vibrational quantum state. Nonadiabatic effects only lead to subtle changes in rovibrationally inelastic state-to-state scattering probabilities. The differences between jellium-based isotropic local density friction and full ab-initio response-theory-based orbital-dependent friction are even more subtle. The presented machine learning models represent the most accurate publicly available, full-dimensional models for H$_2$ on copper to date.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Varieties in Second Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop algebraic geometry for coupled cluster theory in second quantization. In quantum chemistry, electronic systems are represented by elements in the exterior algebra. The creation and annihilation operators of particles generate a Clifford algebra known as the Fermi-Dirac algebra. We present a non-commutative Gr\"obner basis giving an alternative proof of Wick's theorem, a foundational result in quantum chemistry. In coupled cluster theory, the Schr\"odinger equation is approximated through a hierarchy of polynomial equations at various levels of truncation. The exponential parameterization gives rise to the Fock space truncation varieties. This reveals well-known varieties, such as the Grassmannian, flag varieties and spinor varieties. We offer a detailed study of the truncation varieties and their CC degrees. We classify all cases for when the CC degree is equal to the degree of a graph of the exponential parametrization.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Assisted Fermionic Compression Encoding: A Lossy-QSCI Framework for Scalable Quantum Chemistry Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize many-body simulations for quantum chemistry, but its potential is constrained by limited qubits and noise in current devices. In this work, we introduce the Lossy Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (Lossy-QSCI) framework, which combines a lossy subspace Hamiltonian preparation pipeline with a generic QSCI selection process. This framework integrates a chemistry-inspired lossy Random Linear Encoder (Chemical-RLE) with a neural network-assisted Fermionic Expectation Decoder (NN-FED). The RLE leverages fermionic number conservation to compress quantum states, reducing qubit requirements to O(N log M) for M spin orbitals and N electrons, while preserving crucial ground state information and enabling self-consistent configuration recovery. NN-FED, powered by a neural network trained with minimal data, efficiently decodes these compressed states, overcoming the measurement challenges common in the approaches of the traditional QSCI and its variants. Through iterative quantum sampling and classical post-processing, our hybrid method refines ground state estimates with high efficiency. Demonstrated on the C2 and LiH molecules, our framework achieves chemical accuracy with fewer qubits and basis states, paving a scalable pathway for quantum chemistry simulations on both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A new generation of effective core potentials: Selected lanthanides and heavy elements II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.</description>

      <title>INN-FF: A Scalable and Efficient Machine Learning Potential for Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to accurately model interatomic interactions in large-scale systems is fundamental to understanding a wide range of physical and chemical phenomena, from drug-protein binding to the behavior of next-generation materials. While machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have made it possible to achieve ab initio-level accuracy at significantly reduced computational cost, they still require very large training datasets and incur substantial training time and expense. In this work, we propose the Interpolating Neural Network Force Field (INN-FF), a novel framework that merges interpolation theory and tensor decomposition with neural network architectures to efficiently construct molecular dynamics potentials from limited quantum mechanical data. Interpolating Neural Networks (INNs) achieve comparable or better accuracy than traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. On benchmark datasets such as liquid water and rMD17, INN-FF not only matches but often surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy by an order of magnitude, while achieving significantly lower error when trained on smaller datasets. These results suggest that INN-FF offers a promising path toward building efficient and scalable machine-learned force fields.</description>

      <title>Material properties of biomolecular condensates emerge from nanoscale dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</description>
