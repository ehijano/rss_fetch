      <title>Resilience of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the issue of resilience of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) given the many indications that this dynamical system is in a multi-stable regime. A novel approach to resilience based on rare event techniques is presented which leads to a measure capturing `resistance to change` and `ability to return' aspects in a probabilistic way. The application of this measure to a conceptual model demonstrates its suitability for assessing AMOC resilience but also shows its potential use in many other non-autonomous dynamical systems. This framework is then extended to compute the probability that the AMOC undergoes a transition conditioned on an external forcing. Such conditional probability can be estimated by exploiting the information available when computing the resilience of this system. This allows us to provide a probabilistic view on safe operating spaces by defining a conditional safe operating space as a subset of the parameter space of the (possibly transient) imposed forcing.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Modeling and Hindcasting Lake Michigan Ice Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large lakes, ice cover plays an important role in shipping and navigation, coastal erosion, regional weather and climate, and aquatic ecosystem function. In this study, a novel deep learning model for ice cover concentration prediction in Lake Michigan is introduced. The model uses hindcasted meteorological variables, water depth, and shoreline proximity as inputs, and NOAA ice charts for training, validation, and testing. The proposed framework leverages Convolution Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies between model input and output to simulate daily ice cover at 0.1{\deg} resolution. The model performance was assessed through lake-wide average metrics and local error metrics, with detailed evaluations conducted at six distinct locations in Lake Michigan. The results demonstrated a high degree of agreement between the model's predictions and ice charts, with an average RMSE of 0.029 for the daily lake-wide average ice concentration. Local daily prediction errors were greater, with an average RMSE of 0.102. Lake-wide and local errors for weekly and monthly averaged ice concentrations were reduced by almost 50% from daily values. The accuracy of the proposed model surpasses currently available physics-based models in the lake-wide ice concentration prediction, offering a promising avenue for enhancing ice prediction and hindcasting in large lakes.</description>

      <title>Research on the Acoustic Emission Source Localization Methodology in Composite Materials based on Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, methodology of acoustic emission source localization in composite materials based on artificial intelligence was presented. Carbon fiber reinforced plastic was selected for specimen, and acoustic emission signal were measured using piezoelectric devices. The measured signal was wavelet-transformed to obtain scalograms, which were used as training data for the artificial intelligence model. AESLNet(acoustic emission source localization network), proposed in this study, was constructed convolutional layers in parallel due to anisotropy of the composited materials. It is regression model to detect the coordinates of acoustic emission source location. Hyper-parameter of network has been optimized by Bayesian optimization. It has been confirmed that network can detect location of acoustic emission source with an average error of 3.02mm and a resolution of 20mm.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning approaches to reactor antineutrino detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear reactors produce a high flux of MeV-scale antineutrinos that can be observed through inverse beta-decay (IBD) interactions in particle detectors. Reliable detection of reactor IBD signals depends on suppression of backgrounds, both by physical shielding and vetoing and by pattern recognition and rejection in acquired data. A particularly challenging background to reactor antineutrino detection is from cosmogenically induced fast neutrons, which can mimic the characteristics of an IBD signal. In this work, we explore two methods of machine learning -- a tree-based classifier and a graph-convolutional neural network -- to improve rejection of fast neutron-induced background events in a water Cherenkov detector. The tree-based classifier examines classification at the reconstructed feature level, while the graphical network classifies events using only the raw signal data. Both methods improve the sensitivity for a background-dominant search over traditional cut-and-count methods, with the greatest improvement being from the tree-based classification method. These performance enhancements are relevant for reactor monitoring applications that make use of deep underground oil-based or water-based kiloton-scale detectors with multichannel, PMT-based readouts, and they are likely extensible to other similar physics analyses using this class of detector.</description>

      <title>Procedure to Reveal the Mechanism of Pattern Formation Process by Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a versatile tool that can be used to extract scientific knowledge from complex pattern formation processes. However, the physics correspondence between the features obtained from TDA and pattern dynamics does not agree one-to-one, and the physical interpretation of the TDA features needs to be set appropriately according to the phenomenon to be analyzed. In this study, we propose an analytical procedure to physically interpret pattern dynamics through TDA and machine learning techniques. The proposed procedure was applied to the process of magnetic domain pattern formation to quantify non-trivial domain pattern classifications and reveal the nature of the underlying dynamics. On the basis of these findings, we also propose a candidate reduction model to understand the nature of magnetic domain formation.</description>

      <title>Efficient factored gradient descent algorithm for quantum state tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05341v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the state of quantum many-body systems is of fundamental importance in quantum information tasks, but extremely challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we present an efficient quantum tomography protocol that combines the state-factored with eigenvalue mapping to address the rank-deficient issue and incorporates a momentum-accelerated gradient descent algorithm to speed up the optimization process. We implement extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that our factored gradient descent algorithm efficiently mitigates the rank-deficient problem and admits orders of magnitude better tomography accuracy and faster convergence. We also find that our method can accomplish the full-state tomography of random 11-qubit mixed states within one minute.</description>

      <title>Information FOMO: The unhealthy fear of missing out on information. A method for removing misleading data for healthier models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misleading or unnecessary data can have out-sized impacts on the health or accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) models. We present a Bayesian sequential selection method, akin to Bayesian experimental design, that identifies critically important information within a dataset, while ignoring data that is either misleading or brings unnecessary complexity to the surrogate model of choice. Our method improves sample-wise error convergence and eliminates instances where more data leads to worse performance and instabilities of the surrogate model, often termed sample-wise ``double descent''. We find these instabilities are a result of the complexity of the underlying map and linked to extreme events and heavy tails.
  Our approach has two key features. First, the selection algorithm dynamically couples the chosen model and data. Data is chosen based on its merits towards improving the selected model, rather than being compared strictly against other data. Second, a natural convergence of the method removes the need for dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets. Instead, the selection metric inherently assesses testing and validation error through global statistics of the model. This ensures that key information is never wasted in testing or validation. The method is applied using both Gaussian process regression and deep neural network surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Parton Labeling without Matching: Unveiling Emergent Labelling Capabilities in Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton labeling methods are widely used when reconstructing collider events with top quarks or other massive particles. State-of-the-art techniques are based on machine learning and require training data with events that have been matched using simulations with truth information. In nature, there is no unique matching between partons and final state objects due to the properties of the strong force and due to acceptance effects. We propose a new approach to parton labeling that circumvents these challenges by recycling regression models. The final state objects that are most relevant for a regression model to predict the properties of a particular top quark are assigned to said parent particle without having any parton-matched training data. This approach is demonstrated using simulated events with top quarks and outperforms the widely-used $\chi^2$ method.</description>

      <title>Shot noise-mitigated secondary electron imaging with ion count-aided microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern science is dependent on imaging on the nanoscale, often achieved through processes that detect secondary electrons created by a highly focused incident charged particle beam. Multiple types of measurement noise limit the ultimate trade-off between the image quality and the incident particle dose, which can preclude useful imaging of dose-sensitive samples. Existing methods to improve image quality do not fundamentally mitigate the noise sources. Furthermore, barriers to assigning a physically meaningful scale make the images qualitative. Here we introduce ion count-aided microscopy (ICAM), which is a quantitative imaging technique that uses statistically principled estimation of the secondary electron yield. With a readily implemented change in data collection, ICAM substantially reduces source shot noise. In helium ion microscopy, we demonstrate 3x dose reduction and a good match between these empirical results and theoretical performance predictions. ICAM facilitates imaging of fragile samples and may make imaging with heavier particles more attractive.</description>

      <title>Correlations versus noise in the NFT market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-fungible token (NFT) market emerges as a recent trading innovation leveraging blockchain technology, mirroring the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. The current study is based on the capitalization changes and transaction volumes across a large number of token collections on the Ethereum platform. In order to deepen the understanding of the market dynamics, the collection-collection dependencies are examined by using the multivariate formalism of detrended correlation coefficient and correlation matrix. It appears that correlation strength is lower here than that observed in previously studied markets. Consequently, the eigenvalue spectra of the correlation matrix more closely follow the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, still, some departures indicating the existence of correlations remain. The comparison of results obtained from the correlation matrix built from the Pearson coefficients and, independently, from the detrended cross-correlation coefficients suggests that the global correlations in the NFT market arise from higher frequency fluctuations. Corresponding minimal spanning trees (MSTs) for capitalization variability exhibit a scale-free character while, for the number of transactions, they are somewhat more decentralized.</description>
