      <title>Nodal Spectral Functions Stabilized by Non-Hermitian Topology of Quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum materials, basic observables such as spectral functions and susceptibilities are determined by Green's functions and their complex quasiparticle spectrum rather than by bare electrons. Even in closed many-body systems, this makes a description in terms of effective non-Hermitian (NH) Bloch Hamiltonians natural and intuitive. Here, we discuss how the abundance and stability of nodal phases is drastically affected by NH topology. While previous work has mostly considered complex degeneracies known as exceptional points as the NH counterpart of nodal points, we propose to relax this assumption by only requiring a crossing of the real part of the complex quasiparticle spectra, which entails a band crossing in the spectral function, i.e. a nodal spectral function. Interestingly, such real crossings are topologically protected by the braiding properties of the complex Bloch bands, and thus generically occur already in one-dimensional systems without symmetry or fine-tuning. We propose and study a microscopic lattice model in which a sublattice-dependent interaction stabilizes nodal spectral functions. Besides the gapless spectrum, we identify non-reciprocal charge transport properties after a local potential quench as a key signature of non-trivial band braiding. Finally, in the limit of zero interaction on one of the sublattices, we find a perfectly ballistic unidirectional mode in a non-integrable environment, reminiscent of a chiral edge state known from quantum Hall phases. Our analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations both in the framework of exact diagonalization and within the conserving second Born approximation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall interferometry at finite bias with multiple edge channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a quantum Hall interferometer, the dependence of the signal on source-drain voltage is controlled by details of the edge physics, such as the velocities of edge modes and the interaction between them and with screening layers. Such dependence of the signal has been seen in recent experiments at various integer and fractional filling factors, including $\nu=2$ and $\nu=2/5$ where two edge modes are present. Here we study theoretically the current-voltage curves for various values of the relative edge velocities, interaction strength and the temperature, in a model containing two edge modes. We consider separate cases where the inner mode or the outer mode is weakly backscattered at the tunneling contacts. When the inner mode is completely reflected and the outer mode is partially transmitted, we find striking features at very low temperatures related to resonance of excitations of the closed inner channel. Fluctuations in the charge of the closed inner mode, caused by sparse tunneling events, lead to an exponential suppression of the interference visibility at high voltages, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-space topological invariants were widely used to characterize chiral-symmetric higher-order topological phases (HOTPs). However, a momentum-space characterization to these HOTPs, which essentially reveals their intrinsic bulk-boundary correspondence and facilitates their detection in quantum simulation systems, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experimentally observable momentum-space characterization to the chiral-symmetric HOTPs by the concept of polarized topological charges. It makes a unified description to the HOTPs caused by the closing and reopening of band gap not only of the bulk states but also the edge states. Remarkably, these polarized topological charges can also be identified by measuring the pseudospin structures. A feasible scheme to detect the HOTPs in the $^{87}$Rb atomic system is given. Our work opens an avenue for characterization and experimental detection of the HOTPs in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Negative longitudinal resistance of monolayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quantum Hall regime the charge current is carried by ideal one-dimensional edge channels where the backscattering is prohibited by topology. This results in the constant potential along the edge of the Hall bar leading to zero 4-terminal longitudinal resistance r_xx. Finite scattering between the counter-propagating edge states, when the topological protection is broken, commonly results in r_xx &gt; 0. However, a local disorder, if allowing intersection of the edge states, can result in a counter-intuitive scenario when r_xx&lt;0. In this work we report the observation and a systematic study of such unconventional negative longitudinal resistance seen in an encapsulated monolayer graphene Hall bar device measured in the quantum Hall regime. We supplement our findings with the numerical calculations which allow us to outline the conditions necessary for the appearance of negative r_xx and to exclude the macroscopic disorder (contamination bubble) as the main origin of it.</description>

      <title>Magnetization dynamics driven by displacement currents across a magnetic tunnel junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the high-frequency transport characteristics of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is crucial for the development of fast-operating spintronics memories and radio frequency devices. Here, we present the study of frequency-dependent capacitive current effect in CoFeB/MgO-based MTJs and its influence on magnetization dynamics using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect technique. In our device operating at gigahertz frequencies, we find a large displacement current of the order of mA's, which does not break the tunnel barrier of the MTJ. Importantly, this current generates an Oersted field and spin-orbit torque, inducing magnetization dynamics. Our discovery holds promise for building robust MTJ devices operating under high current conditions, also highlighting the significance of capacitive impedance in high frequency magnetotransport techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike charge, heat flows are difficult to control. We show that, in mesoscopic conductors, electronic thermal currents can be manipulated with a magnetic field by using the Aharonov-Bohm effect: the magnetic control of the interference pattern enhances the thermoelectric effect, while heat transport can be totally suppressed. In a three-terminal configuration, the flux-induced broken reciprocity generates a non-local thermoelectric response and translates to the circulation of heat. This way, efficient thermoelectric generators, thermal switches and thermal circulators, as well as energy harvesters can be defined for minimally disturbing thermal management at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Self-correcting GKP qubit and gates in a driven-dissipative circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a circuit architecture for a dissipatively error-corrected GKP qubit. The device consists of a high-impedance LC circuit coupled to a Josephson junction and a resistor via a controllable switch. When the switch is activated via a particular family of stepwise protocols, the resistor absorbs all noise-induced entropy, resulting in dissipative error correction of both phase and amplitude errors. This leads to an exponential increase of qubit lifetime, reaching beyond 10ms in simulations with near-feasible parameters. We show that the lifetime remains exponentially long in the presence of extrinsic noise and device/control imperfections (e.g., due to parasitics and finite control bandwidth) under specific thresholds. In this regime, lifetime is likely only limited by phase slips and quasiparticle tunneling. We show that the qubit can be read out and initialized via measurement of the supercurrent in the Josephson junction. We finally show that the qubit supports native self-correcting single-qubit Clifford gates, where dissipative error-correction of control noise leads to exponential suppression of gate infidelity.</description>

      <title>Topological flat bands in a family of multilayer graphene moir\'e lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials host a wealth of intertwined correlated and topological states of matter, all arising from flat electronic bands with nontrivial quantum geometry. A prominent example is the family of alternating-twist magic-angle graphene stacks, which exhibit symmetry-broken states at rational fillings of the moir\'e band and superconductivity close to half filling. Here, we introduce a second family of twisted graphene multilayers made up of twisted sheets of $M$- and $N$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene flakes. Calculations indicate that applying an electric displacement field isolates a flat and topological moir\'e conduction band that is primarily localized to a single graphene sheet below the moir\'e interface. Phenomenologically, the result is a striking similarity in the hierarchies of symmetry-broken phases across this family of twisted graphene multilayers. Our results show that this family of structures offers promising new opportunities for the discovery of exotic new correlated and topological phenomena, enabled by using the layer number to fine tune the flat moir\'e band and its screening environment.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity of supercurrent along applied magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.</description>

      <title>Switching between superconductivity and current density waves in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An out-of-plane magnetic field can always suppress superconductivity. In Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), recently observed activation of superconductivity (SC) through either in-plane magnetic fields or proximate spin-orbit coupling (SOC) offers a rare instance of switching superconductivity on. To understand this, we must first examine the non-superconducting state. We propose an incommensurate current density wave (CrDW) driven by van Hove singularities away from the zone corners as a competing order. We note that the two switches, the in-plane field and the SOC, both break spin degeneracy. Our parquet renormalization group analysis reveals that breaking spin degeneracy shifts the balance from CrDW, favored under spin degeneracy, to SC when degeneracy is lifted. Driven by purely repulsive interactions, the pairing symmetry of the resulting SC is $p/d$-wave. The presence of CrDW accounts for the non-linear $I-V$ behavior in the normal state and suggests potential anomalous Hall effects due to time-reversal symmetry breaking. We further predict that reducing screening could enhance SC.</description>

      <title>Giant Thermoelectric Response of Fluxons in Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric devices that operate on quantum principles have been under extensive investigation in the past decades. These devices are at the fundamental limits of miniaturized heat engines and refrigerators, advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics. Most research in this area concerns the use of conduction electrons and holes as charge and heat carriers, and only very recently have superconductors been considered as thermal engines and thermoelectric devices. Here, we investigate the thermoelectric response of an Abrikosov vortex in type-II superconductors in the deep quantum limit. We consider two thermoelectric geometries, a type-II SIN junction and a local Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)-tip normal metal probe over the superconductor. We exploit the strong breaking of particle-hole symmetry in bound states at sub-gap energies within the superconducting vortex to realize a giant thermoelectric response in the presence of fluxons. We predict a thermovoltage of a few mV/K at sub-Kelvin temperatures using both semi-analytic and numerical self-consistent solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Relevant thermoelectric coefficients and figures of merit are found within our model, both in linear and nonlinear regimes. The ZT of the SIN junction is around 1, rising to above 3 for the STM junction centered at the vortex core. We also discuss how this system can be used as a sensitive thermocouple, diode, or localized bolometer to detect low-energy single photons.</description>

      <title>Controlled Fabrication of Native Ultra-Thin Amorphous Gallium Oxide from 2D Gallium Sulfide for Emerging Electronic Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxidation of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials has proven advantageous in creating oxide/2D material heterostructures, opening the door for a new paradigm of low-power electronic devices. Gallium (II) sulfide ($\beta$-GaS), a hexagonal phase group III monochalcogenide, is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap exceeding 3 eV in single and few layer form. Its oxide, gallium oxide (Ga$_2$O$_3$), combines large bandgap (4.4-5.3 eV) with high dielectric constant (~10). Despite the technological potential of both materials, controlled oxidation of atomically-thin $\beta$-GaS remains under-explored. This study focuses into the controlled oxidation of $\beta$-GaS using oxygen plasma treatment, achieving ultrathin native oxide (GaS$_x$O$_y$, ~4 nm) and GaS$_x$O$_y$/GaS heterostructures where the GaS layer beneath remains intact. By integrating such structures between metal electrodes and applying electric stresses as voltage ramps or pulses, we investigate their use for resistive random-access memory (ReRAM). The ultrathin nature of the produced oxide enables low operation power with energy use as low as 0.22 nJ per operation while maintaining endurance and retention of 350 cycles and 10$^4$ s, respectively. These results show the significant potential of the oxidation-based GaS$_x$O$_y$/GaS heterostructure for electronic applications and, in particular, low-power memory devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the potential of electronic interferometers for probing the quantum state of electromagnetic radiation on a chip at sub-nanosecond time scales. We propose to use single electron excitations propagating within an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the Aharonov-Bohm dominated regime. We discuss how information about the quantum state of the electromagnetic radiation is encoded into the interference contribution to the average outgoing electrical current. By investigating squeezed radiation and single edge magnetoplasmons probed by Leviton pulses in a realistic setup, we show that single electron interferometers have the potential to probe quantum radiation in the time domain with sub-nanosecond to pico-second time resolution. Our research could have significant implications for probing the fundamental properties of light in the microwave to tera-Hertz domains at extremely short time scales.</description>

      <title>Strong electrostatic control of excitonic features in MoS$_2$ by a free-standing ultrahigh-$\kappa$ ferroelectric perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the electrostatic control of photoluminescence of monolayer MoS$_2$ at room temperature via integration of free-standing BaTiO$_3$ (BTO), a ferroelectric perovskite oxide, layers. We show that the use of BTO leads to highly tunable exciton emission of MoS$_2$ in a minimal range of gate voltages, effectively controlling the neutral excitons to charged excitons (trions) conversion. Due to BTO's ferroelectric polarization-induced doping we observe large peak emission shifts as well as a large and tunable A trion binding energy in the range of 40-100 meV. To further investigate the efficacy of electrostatic control, we compared our measurements with those carried out when the BTO is replaced by a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric layer of comparable thickness, confirming BTO's superior gating properties and thus lower power consumption. Additionally, we take advantage of the ferroelectric switching of BTO by fabricating devices where the BTO layer is decoupled from the gate electrode with a SiO$_2$ layer. Choosing to isolate the BTO allows us to induce large remanent behavior of MoS$_2$'s excitonic features, observing hysteretic behavior in the peak energy ratio between A exciton and its trion, as well as hysteretic behavior in the doping-related trion energy shift. This study illustrates the rich physics involved in combining free-standing complex oxide layers with two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Andreev-like Reflection in the Pfaffian Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>

Abstract: We studied the tunnel transport between the edge of a Pfaffian fractional quantum Hall state and that of an integer quantum Hall state. Based on the duality argument between the strong and weak tunnelings, we found that an Andreev-like reflection appeared in the strong tunneling regime. We calculated the charge conductance in the weak and strong tunneling regimes for the low-voltage limit. In the weak tunneling limit, $dI}/dV$ was proportional to $V^{1/\nu}$ with bias voltage $V$ and $\nu=1/2$. By contrast, in the strong tunneling limit, $dI/dV$ was expressed by $(e^{2}/h)2\nu/(1+\nu)$ with a correction term. We expect that this condition can be realized experimentally at the point contact between a fractional quantum Hall state with $\nu=5/2$ and an integer quantum Hall state with $\nu=3$.</description>

      <title>Breaking and resurgence of symmetry in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in photonic waveguides</title>

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the cornerstones of modern physics and has profound implications in different areas. In symmetry-protected topological systems, symmetries are responsible for protecting surface states, which are at the heart of the fascinating properties exhibited by these materials. When the symmetry protecting the edge mode is broken, the topological phase becomes trivial. By engineering losses that break the symmetry protecting a topological Hermitian phase, we show that a new genuinely non-Hermitian symmetry emerges, which protects and selects one of the boundary modes: the topological monomode. Moreover, the topology of the non-Hermitian system can be characterized by an effective Hermitian Hamiltonian in a higher dimension. To corroborate the theory, we experimentally investigated the non-Hermitian 1D and 2D SSH models using photonic lattices and observed dynamically generated monomodes in both cases. We classify the systems in terms of the (non-Hermitian) symmetries that are present and calculate the corresponding topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Chiral limit and origin of topological flat bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of zero field fractional quantum Hall analogs in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) asks for a deeper understanding of what mechanisms lead to topological flat bands in two-dimensional heterostructures, and what makes TMDs an excellent platform for topologically ordered phases, surpassing twisted bilayer graphene. To this aim, we explore the chiral limits of massive Dirac theories applicable to $C_3$-symmetric moir\'e materials, and show their relevance for both bilayer graphene and TMD homobilayers. In the latter, the Berry curvature of valence bands leads to relativistic corrections of the moir\'e potential that promote band flattening, and permit a limit with exactly flat bands with nonzero Chern number. The relativistic corrections enter as a \emph{layer-orbit coupling}, analogous to spin-orbit coupling for relativistic Dirac fermions, which we show is non-negligible on the moir\'e scale. The Berry curvature of the TMD monolayers therefore plays an essential role in the flattening of moir\'e Chern bands in these heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization senses topological phase transition in spin-orbit coupled $\alpha$-$T_3$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-$T_3$ system undergoes a topological phase transition(TPT) between two distinct quantum spin-Hall phases across $\alpha=0.5$ when the spin-orbit interaction of Kane-Mele type is taken into consideration. As a hallmark of such a TPT, we find that the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment change their respective signs across the TPT. We also find the trails of the TPT in another physical observable, namely, the orbital magnetization(OM) that can be, in principle, detected experimentally through the circular dichroism associated with optical absorption. The topological features of the OM are understood in terms of valley and spin physics. The valley-resolved OM(VROM) and the spin-resolved OM(SROM) exhibit interesting characteristics related to the valley and the spin Chern number when the chemical potential is tuned in the forbidden gap(s) of the energy spectrum. In particular, we find that the slope of the VROM versus the chemical potential in the forbidden gap changes its sign abruptly across the TPT, which is also consistent with the corresponding change in the valley Chern number. Moreover, the slope of the SROM demonstrates a sudden jump by one unit of $e/h$ (where $e$ is the electronic charge and $h$ is the Planck's constant) across the TPT, which is also in agreement with the corresponding change in the spin Chern number. It is further seen that a definite spin-valley optical selection rule governs the circular dichroism. The $k$-resolved degree of the optical polarization and the low-frequency differential optical absorbance manifest sign change across the TPT.</description>

Abstract: The periodic Anderson Hamiltonian of the bulk samarium hexaboride is investigated in this article assuming the presence of ferromagnetic impurities (FM). The problem of large on-site electron-electron repulsion is reformulated in terms of a holonomic constraint using slave-boson technique. The model analysis yields the effective mass of electron and the possibility of the quantum anomalous Hall phase with integer value of the Chern number. Upon using the Fu-Kane-Mele formalism, it is indicated that the surface Hamiltonian without FM may correspond to a strong topological insulator.</description>

Abstract: We propose an optical analogue of electron snake states based on artificial gauge magnetic field in photonic graphene with effective strain implemented by varying distance between pillars. We develop an intuitive and exhaustive continuous model based on tight-binding approximation and compare it with numerical simulations of a realistic photonic structure. The allowed lateral propagation direction is shown to be strongly coupled to the valley degree of freedom and the proposed photonic structure may be used a valley filter.</description>

Abstract: Extending the scope of the self-imaging phenomenon, traditionally associated with linear optics, to the domain of magnonics, this study presents the experimental demonstration and numerical analysis of spin-wave (SW) self-imaging in an in-plane magnetized yttrium iron garnet film. We explore this phenomenon using a setup in which a plane SW passes through a diffraction grating, and the resulting interference pattern is detected using Brillouin light scattering. We have varied the frequencies of the source dynamic magnetic field to discern the influence of the anisotropic dispersion relation and the caustic effect on the analyzed phenomenon. We found that at low frequencies and diffraction fields, the caustics determine the interference pattern. However, at large distances from the grating, when the waves of high diffraction order and number of slits contribute to the interference pattern, the self-imaging phenomenon and Talbot-like patterns are formed. This methodological approach not only sheds light on the behavior of SW interference under different conditions but also enhances our understanding of the SW self-imaging process in both isotropic and anisotropic media.</description>

Abstract: Silicon-Germanium heterostructures are a promising quantum circuit platform, but crucial aspects as the long-term charge dynamics and cooldown-to-cooldown variations are still widely unexplored quantitatively. In this letter we present the results of an extensive bias cooling study performed on gated silicon-germanium quantum dots with an Al2O3-dielectric. Over 80 cooldowns were performed in the course of our investigations. The performance of the devices is assessed by low-frequency charge noise measurements in the band of 200 micro Hertz to 10 milli Hertz. We measure the total noise power as a function of the applied voltage during cooldown in four different devices and find a minimum in noise at 0.7V bias cooling voltage for all observed samples. We manage to decrease the total noise power median by a factor of 6 and compute a reduced tunneling current density using Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. Furthermore, we show the variation in noise from the same device in the course of eleven different cooldowns performed under the nominally same conditions.</description>

Abstract: Planar germanium quantum wells have recently been shown to host a hard-gapped superconductor-semiconductor interface. Additionally, quantum dot spin qubits in germanium are well-suited for quantum information processing, with isotopic purification to a nuclear spin-free material expected to yield long coherence times. Therefore, as one of the few group IV materials with the potential to host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, proximitized quantum dots in germanium are a crucial ingredient towards topological superconductivity and novel qubit modalities. Here we demonstrate a quantum dot (QD) in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtGeSi) superconducting lead (SC), forming a SC-QD-SC junction. We show tunability of the QD-SC coupling strength, as well as gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap. We further exploit this tunability by exhibiting control of the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize the critical magnetic field strengths, finding a robust critical out-of-plane field of 0.91(5) T. Finally we explore sub-gap spin splitting in the device, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. The demonstration of controllable proximitization at the nanoscale of a germanium quantum dot opens up the physics of novel spin and superconducting qubits, and Josephson junction arrays in a group IV material.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators, featuring bulk-boundary correspondence, have been realized on a large number of noncrystalline materials, among which amorphous network, quasicrystals and fractal lattices are the most prominent ones. By contrast, topological superconductors beyond the realm of quantum crystals are yet to be harnessed, as their nucleation takes place around a well-defined Fermi surface with a Fermi momentum, the existence of which rests on the underlying translational symmetry. Here we identify a family of noncrystalline Dirac materials, devoid of time-reversal (${\mathcal T}$) and translational symmetries, on which a suitable local or on-site pairing yields topological superconductors. We showcase this outcome on all the above mentioned noncrystalline platforms embedded in a two-dimensional flat space. The resulting noncrystalline topological superconductors possess quantized topological invariants (Bott index and local Chern marker) and harbor robust one-dimensional Majorana edge modes, analogs of ${\mathcal T}$-odd $p+ip$ pairing in noncrystalline materials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that a periodically driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with imbalanced on-site gain/loss supports universal one-way transport that is immune to impurities and independent of initial excitations. We reveal the underlying mechanism that the periodic driving gives rise to the non-Hermitian skin effect in the effective Floquet Hamiltonian, thereby causing universal non-reciprocal transport. Additionally, we probe the time-average decay rate of the propagator under long-time bulk dynamics as a signature of the Floquet emergent non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results provide a feasible and controllable way to realize universal one-way transport that is easily accessible to experiments.</description>

Abstract: Chiral properties have seen increasing use in recent years, leading to the emerging fields of chiral quantum optics, plasmonics, and phononics. While these fields have achieved manipulation of the chirality of light and lattice vibrations, controlling the chirality of materials on demand has yet remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that linearly polarized phonons can be used to induce geometric chirality in achiral crystals when excited with an ultrashort laser pulse. We show that nonlinear phonon coupling quasistatically displaces the crystal structure along phonon modes that reduce the symmetry of the lattice to that of a chiral point group corresponding to a chiral crystal. By reorienting the polarization of the laser pulse, the two enantiomers can be induced selectively. Therefore, geometric chiral phonons enable the light-induced creation of chiral crystal structures and offer a pathway to engineering chiral electronic states and optical properties.</description>

Abstract: The noncollinear spin textures provide promising avenues to stabilize exotic magnetic phases and excitations. They have attracted vast attention owning to their nontrivial band topology in the past decades. Distinct from the conventional route of involving the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in a honeycomb magnet, the interplay of bond-dependent Kitaev and $\Gamma$ interactions, originating from the spin-orbit coupling and octahedra crystal field in real materials, has demonstrated to be another source to generate noncollinear spin textures with multiple spins in a magnetic unit cell. Notably, earlier works have revealed a triple-meron crystal (TmX) consisting of eighteen spins in the frustrated Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model. Aligning with previous efforts, here we attempt to identify that the TmX hosts several peculiar features with the help of the linear spin-wave theory. To begin with, the symmetric anisotropic exchanges are beneficial for the existence of nonreciprocal magnons, which are stabilized by an external magnetic field. Further, within the regime of TmX, successive topological phase transitions occur, accompanied by the changes of Chern number in value and thermal Hall conductivity in sign. In addition, topological nature of magnons is also verified by the onset of chiral edge modes in a nanoribbon geometry. Our findings pave the way to study topological phenomena of noncollinear spin textures in potential Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Colossal Layer Nernst Effect in Twisted Moir\'{e} Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a theoretical analysis of the emergence of layer-contrasted Nernst response perpendicular to the direction of the temperature gradient in twisted moir\'{e} layers, called layer Nernst effect (LNE). This phenomenon arises from the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface along with a layer-contrasted pseudomagnetic field. Interestingly, the Fermi surface's warping explicitly breaks intra-valley inversion symmetry, which leads to an imbalance between left- and right-moving carriers, thus resulting in a non-vanishing LNE. We then validate our theoretical scheme by applying it to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Importantly, we find that the LNE coefficient in TBG can reach values as high as $10^3$A/(m$\cdot$K), surpassing those of previously known materials by at least one order of magnitude. These results provide a theoretical foundation for utilizing TBG and other twisted moir\'{e} layers as promising platforms to explore layer caloritronics and develop thermoelectric devices.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we theoretically report a new large family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal sulfides $M$$_{2}$S with MXene structure in 2H and 1T phases, which we name as MSene. Twenty-four out of fifty-eight MSenes are proved to be stable. Notably, this family includes twelve superconducting (SC) materials, seven SC topological metals (SCTMs), four charge density wave (CDW) materials, and five magnetic materials including one ferromagnetic (FM) and four antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. For example, 2H-Mo$_{2}$S is a SCTM which exhibits SC critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of 10.2 K and nontrivial topological properties; 1T-Hf$_{2}$S is a CDW material with the CDW originating from electron-phonon coupling. The CDW can be suppressed by compressive strain, leading to the emergence of superconductivity; 2H-Cr$_{2}$S and 1T-Mn$_{2}$S show FM and AFM properties, respectively. Thus, the new large family we predicted shows rich physical properties and significantly expands the repertoire of 2D materials. It serves as a novel platform for investigating the competition or coexistence of multiple orders such as SC, CDW, FM, AFM and topological orders in 2D materials.</description>
