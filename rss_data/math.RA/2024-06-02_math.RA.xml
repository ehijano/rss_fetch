      <title>Deformations of phase spaces of Lie algebras via $\mathfrak s$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first use the graded Lie algebra for relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie algebras to give the graded Lie algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements characterize $\mathfrak s$-matrices on pre-Lie algebras. Then we give the cohomology of $\mathfrak s$-matrices and study their deformations. As an application, we study the deformations of phase spaces of Lie algebras via $\mathfrak s$-matrices.</description>

      <title>On the transitivity of Lie ideals and a characterization of perfect Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore general intrinsic and extrinsic conditions that allow the transitivity of the relation of being a Lie ideal, in the sense that if a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$ is a subideal of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ (i.e. there exist Lie subalgebras $\mathfrak{l}_0,\mathfrak{l}_1,\dots,\mathfrak{l}_n$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ with $\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{l}_0\unlhd \mathfrak{l}_1 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd \mathfrak{l}_n=\mathfrak{g}$), then $\mathfrak{h}$ is an ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$. We also prove that perfect Lie algebras of arbitrary dimension and over any field are intrinsically characterized by transitivity of this type; In particular, we show that a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$ is perfect (i.e. $\mathfrak{h}=[\mathfrak{h}, \mathfrak{h}]$) if and only if for any Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ such that $\mathfrak{h}$ is a subideal of $\mathfrak{g}$, it follows that $\mathfrak{h}$ is an ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$.</description>

      <title>Codimensions of algebras with pseudoautomorphism and their exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a fixed field of characteristic zero containing an element $i$ such that $i^2 = -1$. In this paper we consider finite dimensional superalgebras over $F$ endowed with a pseudoautomorphism $p$ and we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding sequence of $p$-codimensions $c_n^p(A),$ $n=1,2, \ldots$. First we give a positive answer to a conjecture of Amitsur in this setting: the $p$-exponent $\exp^p(A) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[n]{c_n^p(A)} $ always exists and it is an integer. In the final part we characterize the algebras whose exponential growth is bounded by $2$.</description>

      <title>Monomial identities in the Weyl algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a question and some enumerative conjectures of Richard Stanley, we explore the equivalence classes of words in the Weyl algebra, $\mathbf{k} \langle D,U\rangle/(DU-UD=1)$. We show that each class is generated by the swapping of adjacent *balanced subwords*, i.e., those which have the same number of $D$'s as $U$'s, and give several other characterizations.
  Armed with this we deduce a number of enumerative results about the number of such equivalence classes and their sizes. We extend these results to the class of $c$-Dyck words, where every prefix has at least $c$ times as many $U$'s as $D$'s. We also connect these results to previous work on bond percolation and rook theory, and generalize them to some other algebras.</description>

      <title>$G$-tables and the Poisson structure of the even cohomology of cotangent bundle of the Heisenberg Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we define the concept of a $G$-table of a $G$-(co)algebra and we compute the $G$-table of some $G$-(co)algebras (here a $G$-algebra is an algebra on which $G$ acts, semisimply, by algebra automorphisms). The $G$-table of a $G$-(co)algebra $A$ is a set of scalars that provides very precise and concise information about both the algebra structure and the $G$-module structure of $A$. In particular, the ordinary multiplication table of $A$ can be derived from the $G$-table of $A$. From the $G$-table of a $G$-algebra $A$ we define a plain algebra $P(A)$ associated to it and we present some basic functoriality results about $P$. Obtaining the $G$-table of a given $G$-algebra $A$ requires a considerable amount of work but, the result, is a very powerful tool as shown in the second part of the paper. Here we compute the $SL(2)$-tables of the Poisson algebra structure of the even-degree part of the cohomology associated to the cotangent bundle of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie group with Lie algebra $h$, that is $H_E(h)=H_E^{\bullet}(h,\bigwedge^{\bullet}h)$. This Poisson $SL(2)$-algebra has dimension 18. From these $SL(2)$-tables we deduce that the underlying Lie algebra of $H_E(h)$ is isomorphic to $gl(3)\ltimes gl(3)_{ab}$ with the first factor acting on the second (abelian) one by the adjoint representation. We find it remarkable that the Lie algebra structure on $H_{E}(h)$ contains a semisimple Lie subalgebra (in this case $sl(3)$) strictly larger than the Levi factor of $\text{Der}(h)$, which in this case is $sl(2)\subset H^{1}(h,h)$. This means that the Levi factor of the Lie algebra $H_{E}(h)$ has nontrivial elements outside $H^{1}(h,h)$. Finally, this leads us to find a family of commutative Poisson algebras whose underlying Lie structure is $gl(n)\ltimes gl(n)_{ab}$ (arbitrary $n$) such that, for $n=3$, is isomorphic to $H_E(h)$.</description>

      <title>The classification of dp-minimal integral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify dp-minimal integral domains, building off the existing classification of dp-minimal fields and dp-minimal valuation rings. We show that if R is a dp-minimal integral domain, then R is a field or a valuation ring or arises from the following construction: there is a dp-minimal valuation overring O extending R, a proper ideal I in O, and a finite subring S in O/I such that R is the preimage of S in O.</description>

      <title>Dimension formulas for period spaces via motives and species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the structure theory of finite dimensional algebras in order to deduce dimension formulas for spaces of period numbers, i.e., complex numbers defined by integrals of algebraic nature. We get a complete and conceptually clear answer in the case of $1$-periods, generalising classical results like Baker's theorem on the logarithms of algebraic numbers and partial results in Huber--W{\"u}stholz \cite{huber-wuestholz}.
  The application to the case of Mixed Tate Motives (i.e., Multiple Zeta Values) recovers the dimension estimates of Deligne--Goncharov \cite{deligne-goncharov}.</description>

      <title>Framization and Deframization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the geometric construction of the framed braid group, we define and study the framization of several Brauer-type monoids and also the set partition monoid, all of which appear in knot theory. We introduce the concept of deframization, which is a procedure to obtain a tied monoid from a given framed monoid. Furthermore, we show in detail how this procedure works on the monoids mentioned above. We also discuss the framization and deframization of some algebras, which are deformations, respectively, of the framized and deframized monoids discussed here.</description>

      <title>Serre's theorem for coherent sheaves via Auslander's techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an abelian category and a distinguished object with a graded endomorphism ring a necessary and sufficient criterion is given so that the category is equivalent to the abelian quotient of the category of finitely presented graded modules modulo the Serre subcategory of finite length modules. A particular example is the category of coherent sheaves on a projective variety, following a theorem of Serre from 1955. The proof uses Auslander's theory of coherent functors, and there are no noetherianess assumptions. A theorem of Lenzing for representations of hereditary algebras is given as an application.</description>
