      <title>A Survey of Physics-Informed AI for Complex Urban Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban systems are typical examples of complex systems, where the integration of physics-based modeling with artificial intelligence (AI) presents a promising paradigm for enhancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and decision-making. In this context, AI excels at capturing complex, nonlinear relationships, while physics-based models ensure consistency with real-world laws and provide interpretable insights. We provide a comprehensive review of physics-informed AI methods in urban applications. The proposed taxonomy categorizes existing approaches into three paradigms - Physics-Integrated AI, Physics-AI Hybrid Ensemble, and AI-Integrated Physics - and further details seven representative methods. This classification clarifies the varying degrees and directions of physics-AI integration, guiding the selection and development of appropriate methods based on application needs and data availability. We systematically examine their applications across eight key urban domains: energy, environment, economy, transportation, information, public services, emergency management, and the urban system as a whole. Our analysis highlights how these methodologies leverage physical laws and data-driven models to address urban challenges, enhancing system reliability, efficiency, and adaptability. By synthesizing existing methodologies and their urban applications, we identify critical gaps and outline future research directions, paving the way toward next-generation intelligent urban system modeling.</description>

      <title>Ball path curvature and in-game free throw shooting proficiency in the National Basketball Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basketball shooting coaches agree that smoother shooting motions are better, but there is less agreement about what "smooth" means quantitatively or what part of the shooting motion needs to be smooth. Using ball tracking data from the 2023-2024 National Basketball Association regular season, we explore the relationship between ball path curvature and free throw shooting performance. We fit B\'ezier curves to the ball tracking data in the sagittal plane and test different methods of calculating path curvature. We find that both max curvature and terminal curvature are negatively associated with shooting performance, but terminal curvature explains much more of the between-player variance in free throw shooting performance. This suggests that shooting coaches would be better off focusing on the smoothness at the end of the shot rather than at the beginning of the forward motion of the ball.</description>

      <title>Infected Smallville: How Disease Threat Shapes Sociality in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the threat of infectious disease influence sociality among generative agents? We used generative agent-based modeling (GABM), powered by large language models, to experimentally test hypotheses about the behavioral immune system. Across three simulation runs, generative agents who read news about an infectious disease outbreak showed significantly reduced social engagement compared to agents who received no such news, including lower attendance at a social gathering, fewer visits to third places (e.g., cafe, store, park), and fewer conversations throughout the town. In interview responses, agents explicitly attributed their behavioral changes to disease-avoidance motivations. A validity check further indicated that they could distinguish between infectious and noninfectious diseases, selectively reducing social engagement only when there was a risk of infection. Our findings highlight the potential of GABM as an experimental tool for exploring complex human social dynamics at scale.</description>

      <title>Belief propagation for networks with loops: The neighborhoods-intersections-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to diminish the damaging effect of loops on belief propagation (BP), the first explicit version of generalized BP for networks, the KCN-method, was recently introduced. Despite its success, the KCN-method spends computational resources inefficiently. Such inefficiencies can quickly turn the exact application of the method unfeasible, since its time complexity increases exponentially with them. This affects for instance tree networks, for which, despite not offering any accuracy advantage with respect to BP, the time complexity of the KCN-method grows exponentially with the nodes' degree. To avoid these issues, we introduce here a new generalized BP scheme, the NIB-method, which only spends computational resources provided they are needed in order to account for correlations in the network. In fact, we show that, given a network with only short loops, the NIB-method is exact and optimal, and we characterize its time complexity reduction with respect to the KCN-method. If long loops are also present, both methods become approximate. In this scenario, we discuss the relation between the methods and we show how to interpolate between them, obtaining a richer family of generalized BP algorithms that trade accuracy for complexity. Lastly, we find a good agreement between the (approximate) KCN and NIB methods when computing the partition function for two artificial networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Radar and Research Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Radar was studied in many Nations for about fifteen years with the production of some hundred publications. In the post 2020 literature, it is shown that, due to the exceedingly low transmitted power, Quantum Radar cannot produce neither significant results nor real world applications. Regrettably, most of the scientific community ignored this negative outcome: a fact worth of exam. A detailed study of such an assessment failure depicts the main shortcomings of the present situation, calling for a redesign of the research assessment at the international level, with proposals shown in the ending section of this paper.</description>

      <title>Recent trends in socio-epidemic modelling: behaviours and their determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spreading dynamics of infectious diseases is influenced by individual behaviours, which are in turn affected by the level of awareness about the epidemic. Modelling the co-evolution of disease transmission and behavioural changes within a population enables better understanding, prediction and control of epidemics. Here, our primary goal is to provide an overview of the most popular modelling approaches, ranging from compartmental mean-field to agent-based models, with a particular focus on how behavioural factors are incorporated into epidemic dynamics. We classify modelling approaches based on the fundamental conceptual distinction between models of behaviours and models of behavioural determinants (such as awareness, beliefs, opinions, or trust); in particular, we observe that most studies model and interpret the variables related to individual responses either as behaviours or as determinants, with the implicit assumption that they correlate linearly. Based on preliminary empirical observations, we then challenge this assumption by analysing a recent dataset about time series of social indicators, collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine the case study of Italian regions and we discover that behavioural responses are poorly explained by awareness, beliefs or trust, thereby calling for a careful interpretation of the modelling assumptions and for the development of further models, which fully account for the inherent complexity of individual responses and human behaviours.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the "Reactive Falling Effect" for rehabilitation and performance boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Logic Workout, a novel training method based on radical dynamic instability combining rolling, deformation and spring instability on small fitballs. By exploiting the "reactive falling effect", it re-engages innate balance mechanisms and forces real-time motor corrections, leading to better joint control, coordination, and movement precision. Preliminary results from a cohort of 18 participants show complete resolution of chronic pain, enhanced functional mobility, and surprising improvements in strength and performance -- challenging the belief that instability training impairs power output. We hypothesise that, by harnessing maximal instability, Logic Workout activates deep neuromuscular pathways and improve rehabilitation outcomes, training efficiency, and athletic performance.</description>

      <title>Detection, attribution, and modeling of climate change: key open issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CMIP global climate models (GCMs) assess that nearly 100% of global surface warming observed between 1850-1900 and 2011-2020 is attributable to anthropogenic drivers like greenhouse gas emissions. These models also generate future climate projections based on shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), aiding in risk assessment and the development of costly Net-Zero climate mitigation strategies. Yet, the CMIP GCMs face significant scientific challenges in attributing and modeling climate change, particularly in capturing natural climate variability over multiple timescales throughout the Holocene. Other key concerns include the reliability of global surface temperature records, the accuracy of solar irradiance models, and the robustness of climate sensitivity estimates. Global warming estimates may be overstated due to uncorrected non-climatic biases, and the GCMs may significantly underestimate solar and astronomical influences on climate variations. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to radiative forcing could be lower than commonly assumed; empirical findings suggest ECS values lower than 3 K and possibly even closer to 1.1 +/- 0.4 K. Empirical models incorporating natural variability suggest that the 21st-century global warming may remain moderate, even under SSP scenarios that do not necessitate Net-Zero emission policies. These findings raise important questions regarding the necessity and urgency of implementing aggressive climate mitigation strategies. While GCMs remain essential tools for climate research and policymaking, their scientific limitations underscore the need for more refined modeling approaches to ensure accurate future climate assessments. Addressing uncertainties related to climate change detection, natural variability, solar influences, and climate sensitivity to radiative forcing will enhance predictions and better inform sustainable climate strategies.</description>

Abstract: An anecdotally common complaint regarding induction into the Gold Humanism Honor Society is the bias toward close friends during the initial nomination process. In this work, we numerically simulate the nomination process under different assumptions, demonstrate that collusion can be detected, and propose a simple strategy to correct for bias in the nomination process.</description>

      <title>A novel approach for converting spatio-temporal series into complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to offer a new perspective on complex network representation of real-world systems. Currently, the most well-known transformation algorithms in the literature treat each data point in a time series as a node and transform the time series into a network. In this study, we present a new approach converting spatio-temporal series into a complex network. We focus on studying this transformation by grounding it in the context of physics , with the aim of adapting it to real-world problems, which often manifest as complex systems across various domains. We introduce the Gravitational Graph (GG) algorithm, which is grounded in the concept of gravitational force from fundamental physics. We consider air pollution concentrations, which represent a global environmental health risk, as an example of a complex environmental system, and apply the GG algorithm to particulate matter of 10 microns (PM10) recorded by 21 air quality monitoring stations located in various regions of Istanbul, Turkiye. While the GG algorithm allows for the conversion of spatio-temporal series -- rather than time series -- into networks, it also enables the analysis of the statistical properties and characteristics of the converted networks, thereby uncovering hidden relationships and dependencies that may not be apparent in the original time series.</description>

      <title>High Socioeconomic Status is Associated with Diverse Consumption across Brands and Price Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consumption practices are determined by a combination of economic, social, and cultural forces. We posit that lower economic constraints leave more room to diversify consumption along cultural and social aspects in the form of omnivorous or lifestyle-based niche consumption. We provide empirical evidence for this diversity hypothesis by analysing millions of mobile-tracked visits from thousands of Census Block Groups to thousands of stores in New York State. The results show that high income is significantly associated with diverse consumption across brands and price levels. The associations between diversity and income persist but are less prominent for necessity-based consumption and for the densely populated and demographically diverse New York City. The associations replicate for education as an alternative measure of socioeconomic status and for the state of Texas. We further illustrate that the associations cannot be explained by simple geographic constraints, including the neighbourhoods' demographic diversity, the residents' geographic mobility and the stores' local availability, so deeper social and cultural factors must be at play.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study a spectral recombination algorithm, SpecReCom, for partitioning a graph into a given number of connected parts. It is straightforward to introduce additional constraints such as the requirement that the weight (or number of vertices) in each part is approximately balanced, and we exemplify this by stating a variant, BalSpecReCom, of the SpecReCom algorithm. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm achieves more compact partitions than alternatives such as RevReCom by studying a $56\times 56$ grid graph and a planar graph obtained from the state of Colorado.</description>

      <title>Community detection in hypergraphs through hyperedge percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex networks often exhibit community structure, with communities corresponding to denser subgraphs in which nodes are closely linked. When modelling systems where interactions extend beyond node pairs to arbitrary numbers of nodes, hypergraphs become necessary, creating a need for specialised community detection methods. Here, we adapt the classical $k$-clique percolation method to hypergraphs, constructing communities from hyperedges containing at least $k$ nodes, defining hyperedge adjacency similarly to clique adjacency. Although the analogy between the proposed hyperedge percolation method and the classical clique percolation algorithm is evident, we show that communities obtained directly from the hyperedges can differ from those identified via clique percolation on the pairwise projection of the hypergraph. We also propose an alternative way for merging hyperedges into communities, where instead of imposing a lower bound on hyperedge cardinality, we restrict the maximum size of the considered hyperedges. This alternative algorithm better suits hypergraphs where larger hyperedges realise weaker linkages between the nodes. After comparing the suggested two approaches on simple synthetic hypergraphs designed to highlight their distinctions, we test them on hypergraphs generated by a newly proposed geometric process on the hyperbolic plane, as well as on some real-world examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate quantitatively, albeit in arbitrary units, the evolution of complexity of the human system since the domestication of fire. This is made possible by studying the timing of the 14 most important milestones, breaks in historical perspective, in the evolution of humans. AI is considered here as the latest such milestone with importance comparable to that of the Internet. The complexity is modeled to have evolved along a bell-shaped curve, reaching a maximum around our times, and soon entering a declining trajectory. According to this curve, the next evolutionary milestone of comparable importance is expected around 2050 and should add less complexity than AI but more than the milestone grouping together nuclear energy, DNA, and the transistor. The peak of the complexity curve coincides squarely with the life span of the baby boomers. The peak in the rate of growth of the world population precedes the complexity peak by 25 years, which is about the time it takes a young man or woman before they are able to add complexity to the human system in a significant way. It is in society's interest to flatten the complexity bell-shaped curve to whatever extent this is possible in order enjoy complexity longer.</description>

      <title>Thermal Macroeconomics: An axiomatic theory of aggregate economic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An axiomatic approach to macroeconomics based on the mathematical structure of thermodynamics is presented. It deduces relations between aggregate properties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money, prices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic foundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents. The approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid foundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence of market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry and negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le Chatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong rationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach generates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two or more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic entropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these are related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market prices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and gives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts, such as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in standard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and implications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility of money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in macroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. More broadly, we hope that the economic analogue of entropy (governing the possible transitions between states of economic systems) may prove to be as fruitful for the social sciences as entropy has been in the natural sciences.</description>
