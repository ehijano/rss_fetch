      <title>Predicting effect of novel treatments using molecular pathways and real-world data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&amp;D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug embeddings.</description>

      <title>BDPM: A Machine Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut Microbiota Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39 Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination), integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability. Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and spatial patterns in microbiome data.</description>

      <title>Triplication: an important component of the modern scientific method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scientific-study protocol, as defined here, is designed to deliver results from which inductive inference is allowed. In the nineteenth century, triplication was introduced into the plant sciences and Fisher's p&lt;0.05 rule (1925) was incorporated into a triple-result protocol designed to counter random/systematic errors. Aims here were to: (1) classify replication (including non-replicated) protocols; (2) assess their prevalence in plant-science studies published in 2017 for a defined variable construct; and (3) explore the theoretical rationale for the use of triplication. Methods: the plant sciences were surveyed and a protocol-prevalence report produced; association versus experimental proportions were analyzed; real-world-data proxies were used to show confidence-interval-width patterns with increasing replicate number. Results: triplication was found in ~70% of plant-science studies analyzed, with triple-result protocols observed in ~15%. Theoretical considerations showed that, even if systematic errors predominate, "square-root rules" sometimes apply, contributing to the predominance of triplication (real-world-data proxy examples given). Conclusions: Triplication was extensively applied in the studies analyzed and there are strong methodological reasons why (1) triplication, rather than duplication/quadruplication, is the most appropriate standard; (2) triple-result protocols are preferable to global averaging approaches; and (3) plant science methodological standards remain high, despite immense publication pressures.</description>
