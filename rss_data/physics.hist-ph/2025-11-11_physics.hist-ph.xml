      <title>Contemporary Perspectivism as a Framework of Scientific Inquiry in Quantum Mechanics and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary perspectivism is viewed as a framework of scientific inquiry concerning the origin, generation and systematization of scientific knowledge of nature by focusing on the conditions under which such knowledge may arise in perspectivist terms and investigating the essential ramifications of these conditions. To this end, we develop the conceptual, methodological and semantic framework of contemporary perspectivism according to the norms of the proposed endo-theoretic approach. Implementation of the preceding three-fold scheme in quantum mechanics implies that the global structure of a quantum algebra of events can be consistently comprehended through a multilevel structure of locally variable Boolean perspectives, interconnected in a category-theoretic environment, yielding jointly all the information encoded in the former. In this respect, the proposed approach validates the perspectivist/contextual nature of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level of discourse. Furthermore, due to its general character, it may acquire the form of a theoretical pattern of scientific inquiry in the natural sciences, especially when dealing with complex trans-perspectival phenomena, the analysis of which requires the use of information resulting from more than one perspective. Finally, in the appendix, we provide a concise comparative assessment between our perspectivist framework of quantum theory and Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model.
  One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson).
  In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that "similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand".</description>

      <title>A computational framework for evaluating an edge-integrated, multi-ramp construction model of the Great Pyramid of Giza</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of study, a quantitative, integrated framework to evaluate minutescale throughput, geometric control, and a zero external footprint for Khufu's pyramid has been lacking. We test the Integrated Edge-Ramp (IER) model-a helical path formed by omitting and backfilling perimeter courses-using a unified, end-to-end pipeline coupling parametric geometry, discrete-event logistics, and staged finite-element analysis (FEA). An adaptive multiramp strategy can sustain 4-6-minute dispatches and yields a median on-site duration of 13.8-20.6 years (95% CI); including quarrying, river transport, and seasonal pauses gives 20-27 years. FEA indicates that stresses and settlements remain within plausible limits for Old Kingdom limestone under self-weight. The model's geometry is also consistent with internal voids identified by muon imaging (a hypothesis-generating result). The IER helps reconcile throughput, survey access, and zero-footprint closure, and produces falsifiable predictions (edge-fill signatures, corner wear). Our study provides a transferable, open-data/code framework for testing construction hypotheses for ancient megastructures.</description>

      <title>Alexander Dalgarno and the development of astrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry arose during the 1970s as observations in previously unexplored parts of the electromagnetic spectrum began to reveal the extent of a molecular component of interstellar matter with a surprisingly rich chemistry. Astrochemistry expanded further in order to explain the role of atomic and molecular processes in a broad range of phenomena in the universe. It is instructive to describe the current scope of astrochemistry using the career and accomplishments of Alexander Dalgarno as an organizing principle. Dalgarno helped to establish a self-sustaining community of astrochemists around the world. His own research interests highlight the early development of astrochemistry and anticipate much of its later evolution. His theoretical investigations of fundamental atomic and molecular processes lie at the heart of the subject.</description>

      <title>The Geometric View of Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent critiques of the semantic conception of scientific theories suggest that a theory is not best formulated as a collection of models satisfying some set of kinematical or dynamical conditions. Thus it has been argued that additional structure on the set of models is required. Furthermore, there are calls for developing a 'theory of theories', where what was formerly a 'theory' is seen as a 'model' within a larger theoretical structure. This paper makes a two-pronged proposal for the "shape" that physical theories should take, based on recent insights on dualities and quasi-dualities in physics. First, I develop a geometric view of theories, according to which a physical theory is a set of models with topological and geometric structure on it. This general view is briefly illustrated in an example from quantum cosmology. Second, I make a more specific proposal for a natural structure that can encompass various 'theories' as its models, with topological and algebraic-geometric structure on them. I call the latter more specific structure a 'model bundle', where the models are in the fibres and there is a moduli space in the base. I illustrate my second proposal in the Seiberg-Witten theory (Seiberg and Witten, 1994a,b), where the moduli space is the complex plane with three punctures, the states and quantities are in the fibres, and the modular group is the structure group that acts on the fibres. This view highlights the important role of quasi-dualities as local transition functions between fibres; dualities are recovered as global transition functions when the bundle is trivial. I discuss some philosophical issues that this geometric view of physical theories opens up, such as its realist interpretation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Like Correlations from Local Hidden-Variable Theories Under Conservation Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision with which we can measure operators that do not commute with conserved quantities is limited by the need to preserve the associated global symmetries. We show how to construct a local hidden-variable model that violates Bell inequalities by interpreting this measurement error as altering the measure space of the hidden variables. This provides a physically-motivated example of a supermeasured model, where the statistical independence assumption used to form Bell inequalities is violated without there being a causal dependence of the measurement settings on the hidden variables (superdeterminism) or a causal dependence of the hidden variables on the measurement settings (retrocausality). The model also gives subtly different predictions to quantum mechanics, that could be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Sufficiency of the counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule to rule out ontological models of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</description>
