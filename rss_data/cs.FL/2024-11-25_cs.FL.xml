      <title>A hierarchy of reversible finite automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, different variants of reversible finite automata are compared, and their hierarchy by the expressive power is established. It is shown that one-way reversible automata with multiple initial states (MRFA) recognize strictly more languages than sweeping reversible automata (sRFA), which are in turn stronger than one-way reversible automata with a single initial state (1RFA). The latter recognize strictly more languages than one-way permutation automata (1PerFA). It is also shown that the hierarchy of sRFA by the number of passes over the input string collapses: it turns out that three passes are always enough. On the other hand, MRFA form a hierarchy by the number of initial states: their subclass with at most $k$ initial states (MRFA$^k$) recognize strictly fewer languages than MRFA$^{k + 1}$, and also MRFA$^k$ are incomparable with sRFA. In the unary case, sRFA, MRFA$^k$ and MRFA become equal in their expressive power, and the inclusion of 1RFA into sRFA remains proper.</description>

      <title>Synchronisability in Mailbox Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of synchronisability for communicating automata, i.e., whether the language of send messages for an asynchronous system is the same as the language of send messages with a synchronous communication. The un/decidability of the problem depends on the specific asynchronous semantics considered as well as the topology (the communication flow) of the system. Synchronisability is known to be undecidable under the peer-to-peer semantics, while it is still an open problem for mailbox communication. The problem was shown to be decidable for ring topologies. In this paper, we show that when generalising to automata with accepting states, synchronisability is undecidable under the mailbox semantics, this result is obtained by resorting to the Post Correspondence problem. In an attempt to solve the specific problem where all states are accepting, we also show that synchronisability is decidable for tree topologies (where, as well as for rings, peer-to-peer coincides with mailbox semantics). We also discuss synchronisability for multitrees in the mailbox setting.</description>

      <title>Dual Adjunction Between $\Omega$-Automata and Wilke Algebra Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\Omega$-automata and Wilke algebras are formalisms for characterising $\omega$-regular languages via their ultimately periodic words. $\Omega$-automata read finite representations of ultimately periodic words, called lassos, and they are a subclass of lasso automata. We introduce lasso semigroups as a generalisation of Wilke algebras that mirrors how lasso automata generalise $\Omega$-automata, and we show that finite lasso semigroups characterise regular lasso languages. We then show a dual adjunction between lasso automata and quotients of the free lasso semigroup with a recognising set, and as our main result we show that this dual adjunction restricts to one between $\Omega$-automata and quotients of the free Wilke algebra with a recognising set.</description>

      <title>Different Strokes in Randomised Strategies: Revisiting Kuhn's Theorem under Finite-Memory Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-player (antagonistic) games on (possibly stochastic) graphs are a prevalent model in theoretical computer science, notably as a framework for reactive synthesis.
  Optimal strategies may require randomisation when dealing with inherently probabilistic goals, balancing multiple objectives, or in contexts of partial information. There is no unique way to define randomised strategies. For instance, one can use so-called mixed strategies or behavioural ones. In the most general setting, these two classes do not share the same expressiveness. A seminal result in game theory -- Kuhn's theorem -- asserts their equivalence in games of perfect recall.
  This result crucially relies on the possibility for strategies to use infinite memory, i.e., unlimited knowledge of all past observations. However, computer systems are finite in practice. Hence it is pertinent to restrict our attention to finite-memory strategies, defined as automata with outputs. Randomisation can be implemented in these in different ways: the initialisation, outputs or transitions can be randomised or deterministic respectively. Depending on which aspects are randomised, the expressiveness of the corresponding class of finite-memory strategies differs.
  In this work, we study two-player concurrent stochastic games and provide a complete taxonomy of the classes of finite-memory strategies obtained by varying which of the three aforementioned components are randomised. Our taxonomy holds in games of perfect and imperfect information with perfect recall, and in games with more than two players. We also provide an adapted taxonomy for games with imperfect recall.</description>

      <title>Introducing q-deformed binomial coefficients of words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian binomial coefficients are q-analogues of the binomial coefficients of integers. On the other hand, binomial coefficients have been extended to finite words, i.e., elements of the finitely generated free monoids. In this paper we bring together these two notions by introducing q-analogues of binomial coefficients of words. We study their basic properties, e.g., by extending classical formulas such as the q-Vandermonde and Manvel's et al. identities to our setting. As a consequence, we get information about the structure of the considered words: these q-deformations of binomial coefficients of words contain much richer information than the original coefficients. From an algebraic perspective, we introduce a q-shuffle and a family q-infiltration products for non-commutative formal power series. Finally, we apply our results to generalize a theorem of Eilenberg characterizing so-called p-group languages. We show that a language is of this type if and only if it is a Boolean combination of specific languages defined through q-binomial coefficients seen as polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds of CFLOBDDs against BDDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are widely used for the representation of Boolean functions. Context-Free-Language Ordered Decision Diagrams (CFLOBDDs) are a plug-compatible replacement for BDDs -- roughly, they are BDDs augmented with a certain form of procedure call. A natural question to ask is, ``For a given family of Boolean functions $F$, what is the relationship between the size of a BDD for $f \in F$ and the size of a CFLOBDD for $f$?'' Sistla et al. established that there are best-case families of functions, which demonstrate an inherently exponential separation between CFLOBDDs and BDDs. They showed that there are families of functions $\{ f_n \}$ for which, for all $n = 2^k$, the CFLOBDD for $f_n$ (using a particular variable order) is exponentially more succinct than any BDD for $f_n$ (i.e., using any variable order). However, they did not give a worst-case bound -- i.e., they left open the question, ``Is there a family of functions $\{ g_i \}$ for which the size of a CFLOBDD for $g_i$ must be substantially larger than a BDD for $g_i$?'' For instance, it could be that there is a family of functions for which the BDDs are exponentially more succinct than any corresponding CFLOBDDs.
  This paper studies such questions, and answers the second question posed above in the negative. In particular, we show that by using the same variable ordering in the CFLOBDD that is used in the BDD, the size of a CFLOBDD for any function $h$ cannot be far worse than the size of the BDD for $h$. The bound that relates their sizes is polynomial: If BDD $B$ for function $h$ is of size $|B|$ and uses variable ordering $\textit{Ord}$, then the size of the CFLOBDD $C$ for $h$ that also uses $\textit{Ord}$ is bounded by $O(|B|^3)$.
  The paper also shows that the bound is tight: there is a family of functions for which $|C|$ grows as $\Omega(|B|^3)$.</description>
