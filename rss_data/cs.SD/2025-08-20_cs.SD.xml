      <title>Is Transfer Learning Necessary for Violin Transcription?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) has achieved remarkable progress for instruments such as the piano, largely due to the availability of large-scale, high-quality datasets. In contrast, violin AMT remains underexplored due to limited annotated data. A common approach is to fine-tune pretrained models for other downstream tasks, but the effectiveness of such transfer remains unclear in the presence of timbral and articulatory differences. In this work, we investigate whether training from scratch on a medium-scale violin dataset can match the performance of fine-tuned piano-pretrained models. We adopt a piano transcription architecture without modification and train it on the MOSA dataset, which contains about 30 hours of aligned violin recordings. Our experiments on URMP and Bach10 show that models trained from scratch achieved competitive or even superior performance compared to fine-tuned counterparts. These findings suggest that strong violin AMT is possible without relying on pretrained piano representations, highlighting the importance of instrument-specific data collection and augmentation strategies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Mamba with Full-Face Vision for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Mamba-based models have shown promise in speech enhancement by efficiently modeling long-range temporal dependencies. However, models like Speech Enhancement Mamba (SEMamba) remain limited to single-speaker scenarios and struggle in complex multi-speaker environments such as the cocktail party problem. To overcome this, we introduce AVSEMamba, an audio-visual speech enhancement model that integrates full-face visual cues with a Mamba-based temporal backbone. By leveraging spatiotemporal visual information, AVSEMamba enables more accurate extraction of target speech in challenging conditions. Evaluated on the AVSEC-4 Challenge development and blind test sets, AVSEMamba outperforms other monaural baselines in speech intelligibility (STOI), perceptual quality (PESQ), and non-intrusive quality (UTMOS), and achieves \textbf{1st place} on the monaural leaderboard.</description>

      <title>DegDiT: Controllable Audio Generation with Dynamic Event Graph Guided Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable text-to-audio generation aims to synthesize audio from textual descriptions while satisfying user-specified constraints, including event types, temporal sequences, and onset and offset timestamps. This enables precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Identity Leakage in Speaker De-Identification Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker de-identification aims to conceal a speaker's identity while preserving intelligibility of the underlying speech. We introduce a benchmark that quantifies residual identity leakage with three complementary error rates: equal error rate, cumulative match characteristic hit rate, and embedding-space similarity measured via canonical correlation analysis and Procrustes analysis. Evaluation results reveal that all state-of-the-art speaker de-identification systems leak identity information. The highest performing system in our evaluation performs only slightly better than random guessing, while the lowest performing system achieves a 45% hit rate within the top 50 candidates based on CMC. These findings highlight persistent privacy risks in current speaker de-identification technologies.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Audio-Visual Learning for Cochlear Implant Sound Coding in Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cochlear implant (CI) is a remarkable biomedical device that successfully enables individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss to perceive sound by converting speech into electrical stimulation signals. Despite advancements in the performance of recent CI systems, speech comprehension in noisy or reverberant conditions remains a challenge. Recent and ongoing developments in deep learning reveal promising opportunities for enhancing CI sound coding capabilities, not only through replicating traditional signal processing methods with neural networks, but also through integrating visual cues as auxiliary data for multimodal speech processing. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel noise-suppressing CI system, AVSE-ECS, which utilizes an audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) model as a pre-processing module for the deep-learning-based ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) sound coding strategy. Specifically, a joint training approach is applied to model AVSE-ECS, an end-to-end CI system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the previous ECS strategy in noisy conditions, with improved objective speech intelligibility scores. The methods and findings in this study demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using deep learning to integrate the AVSE module into an end-to-end CI system</description>

      <title>MMAU-Pro: A Challenging and Comprehensive Benchmark for Holistic Evaluation of Audio General Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio comprehension-including speech, non-speech sounds, and music-is essential for achieving human-level intelligence. Consequently, AI agents must demonstrate holistic audio understanding to qualify as generally intelligent. However, evaluating auditory intelligence comprehensively remains challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MMAU-Pro, the most comprehensive and rigorously curated benchmark for assessing audio intelligence in AI systems. MMAU-Pro contains 5,305 instances, where each instance has one or more audios paired with human expert-generated question-answer pairs, spanning speech, sound, music, and their combinations. Unlike existing benchmarks, MMAU-Pro evaluates auditory intelligence across 49 unique skills and multiple complex dimensions, including long-form audio comprehension, spatial audio reasoning, multi-audio understanding, among others. All questions are meticulously designed to require deliberate multi-hop reasoning, including both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Importantly, audio data is sourced directly ``from the wild" rather than from existing datasets with known distributions. We evaluate 22 leading open-source and proprietary multimodal AI models, revealing significant limitations: even state-of-the-art models such as Gemini 2.5 Flash and Audio Flamingo 3 achieve only 59.2% and 51.7% accuracy, respectively, approaching random performance in multiple categories. Our extensive analysis highlights specific shortcomings and provides novel insights, offering actionable perspectives for the community to enhance future AI systems' progression toward audio general intelligence.

      <title>AxLSTMs: learning self-supervised audio representations with xLSTMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the transformer has emerged as the eminent neural architecture, several independent lines of research have emerged to address its limitations. Recurrent neural approaches have observed a lot of renewed interest, including the extended long short-term memory (xLSTM) architecture, which reinvigorates the original LSTM. However, while xLSTMs have shown competitive performance compared to the transformer, their viability for learning self-supervised general-purpose audio representations has not been evaluated. This work proposes Audio xLSTM (AxLSTM), an approach for learning audio representations from masked spectrogram patches in a self-supervised setting. Pretrained on the AudioSet dataset, the proposed AxLSTM models outperform comparable self-supervised audio spectrogram transformer (SSAST) baselines by up to 25% in relative performance across a set of ten diverse downstream tasks while having up to 45% fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12332v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.</description>

Abstract: We introduce our submission to the AudioMOS Challenge (AMC) 2025 Track 3: mean opinion score (MOS) prediction for speech with multiple sampling frequencies (SFs). Our submitted model integrates an SF-independent (SFI) convolutional layer into a self-supervised learning (SSL) model to achieve SFI speech feature extraction for MOS prediction. We present some strategies to improve the MOS prediction performance of our model: distilling knowledge from a pretrained non-SFI-SSL model and pretraining with a large-scale MOS dataset. Our submission to the AMC 2025 Track 3 ranked the first in one evaluation metric and the fourth in the final ranking. We also report the results of our ablation study to investigate essential factors of our model.</description>

      <title>What Matters for Bioacoustic Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of sounds produced by living organisms, plays a vital role in conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and behavioral studies. Many tasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification and detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds), and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover, they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered: training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes, and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when more data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically, across 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection, individual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics + general-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution performance. We show the importance of data diversity in both stages. To support ongoing research and application, we will release the model checkpoints.</description>

      <title>Can Masked Autoencoders Also Listen to Birds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn rich semantic representations in audio classification through an efficient self-supervised reconstruction task. However, general-purpose models fail to generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains. Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability, revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAEs. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap domain gap requires full-pipeline adaptation, not just domain-specific pretraining data. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe, fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet. Our resulting Bird-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art results in BirdSet's multi-label classification benchmark. Additionally, we introduce the parameter-efficient prototypical probing, enhancing the utility of frozen MAE representations and closely approaching fine-tuning performance in low-resource settings. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37 percentage points in mean average precision and narrow the gap to fine-tuning across BirdSet downstream tasks. Bird-MAE also demonstrates robust few-shot capabilities with prototypical probing in our newly established few-shot benchmark on BirdSet, highlighting the potential of tailored self-supervised learning pipelines for fine-grained audio domains.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Data Curation Matters in Scaling Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of modern speech enhancement systems rely on data-driven neural network models. Conventionally, larger datasets are presumed to yield superior model performance, an observation empirically validated across numerous tasks in other domains. However, recent studies reveal diminishing returns when scaling speech enhancement data. We focus on a critical factor: prevalent quality issues in ``clean'' training labels within large-scale datasets. This work re-examines this phenomenon and demonstrates that, within large-scale training sets, prioritizing high-quality training data is more important than merely expanding the data volume. Experimental findings suggest that models trained on a carefully curated subset of 700 hours can outperform models trained on the 2,500-hour full dataset. This outcome highlights the crucial role of data curation in scaling speech enhancement systems effectively.</description>
