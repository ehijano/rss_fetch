      <title>Theoretical description of atomtronic Josephson junctions in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental realizations of ``atomtronic" Josephson junctions have recently been created in annular traps in relative rotation with respect to potential barriers that generate the weak links. If these devices are additionally subjected to an optical lattice potential, then they can incorporate strong-coupling Mott physics within the design, which can modify the behavior and can allow for interesting new configurations of barriers and of superfluid flow patterns. We examine theoretically the behavior of a Bose superfluid in an optical lattice in the presence of an annular trap and a barrier across the annular region which acts as a Josephson junction. As the superfluid is rotated, circulating super-currents appear. Beyond a threshold superfluid velocity, phase slips develop, which generate vortices. We use a finite temperature strong-coupling expansion about the mean-field solution of the Bose Hubbard model to calculate various properties of such devices. In addition, we discuss some of the rich behavior that can result when there are Mott regions within the system.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom of Two Heavy Impurities in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two heavy impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and calculate the self-energy using the Wilsonian renormalization. The polaron energy, quasiparticle residue and damping rate are extracted from the self-energy. We demonstrate that various effective potentials emerge from the polaron energy under corresponding conditions. In the limit of large separation between the impurities, the polaron spectrum converges to the results for a single impurity, exhibiting an attractive-repulsive crossover across the Feshbach resonance. The boundary of this crossover is identified through the analysis of the damping rate. We highlight that our analysis reveals a repulsive-dominant polaron exists as long as the impurities are sufficiently close, even when the impurity-boson interactions are attractive. Additionally, we observe that the two impurities become asymptotically free in the repulsive polaron regime. These results are verifiable and offer a fresh perspective on the interaction dynamics between two polarons.</description>

      <title>Extended $s$-wave pairing from an emergent Feshbach resonanc in bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates, unraveling the pairing mechanism of charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets has been a long-standing challenge. Motivated by the discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in nickelate bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO), we study a minimal mixed dimensional (MixD) $t-J$ model supplemented with a repulsive Coulomb interaction $V$. When hole-doped, previous numerical simulations revealed that the system exhibits strong binding energies, with a phenomenology resembling a BCS-to-BEC crossover accompanied by a Feshbach resonance between two distinct types of charge carriers. Here, we perform a mean-field analysis that enables a direct observation of the BCS-to-BEC crossover as well as microscopic insights into the crossover region and the pairing symmetry for two-dimensional bilayers. We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing it to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one dimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the two-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a BCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the pairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin. Our analysis hence gives insights into pairing in unconventional superconductors and, further, can be tested in currently available ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Bell correlations between momentum-entangled pairs of $^4\text{He}^*$ atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal entanglement between pair-correlated particles is a highly counter-intuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, where measurement on one particle can instantly affect the other, regardless of distance. While the rigorous Bell's inequality framework has enabled the demonstration of such entanglement in photons and atomic internal states, no experiment has yet involved motional states of massive particles. Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality. This result shows the potential of ultracold atoms for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues to studying gravitational effects in quantum states.</description>

      <title>Emergent spinon-holon Feshbach resonance in a doped Majumdar-Ghosh model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of degenerate stationary states in a boundary-driven dipole-conserving spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structured ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. We show that such a system exhibits a hierarchy of degenerate steady states when driven by incoherent pump and loss at the boundary. By tuning the relative pump and loss and how local the constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiseless subsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve large amounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppresses current in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert space hold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism. Our findings show that a competition of kinetic constraints and local drives can induce different forms of ergodicity breaking in open systems, which should be accessible in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>
