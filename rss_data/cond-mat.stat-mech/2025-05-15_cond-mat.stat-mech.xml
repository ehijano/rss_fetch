      <title>How to Incorporate External Fields in Analog Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). They consist of artificial spins that evolve towards a low-energy configuration representing a problem's solution. Most realistic COPs require both spin-spin couplings and external fields. In IMs with analog spins, these interactions scale differently with the continuous spin amplitudes, leading to imbalances that affect performance. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but their performance has not been benchmarked. We address this gap through a numerical analysis. We evaluate the time-to-solution of these methods across three distinct problem classes with up to 500 spins. Our results show that the most effective way to incorporate external fields is through an approach where the spin interactions are proportional to the spin signs, rather than their continuous amplitudes.</description>

      <title>The Two-Fluid Theory for Superfluid Hydrodynamics and the Fountain Pressure Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-fluid theory for superfluid hydrodynamics is derived from the fountain pressure result that condensed bosons move at constant entropy, and that therefore steady superfluid flow connects regions of equal chemical potential. The paradox of the fountain pressure equation is resolved with a quantitative prediction.</description>

      <title>Effective synchronization amid noise-induced chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is exposing them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. Namely, although the phases of the two clocks vary erratically, their probability distributions at a given moment become identical. We exploit this statistical synchrony to define an effective phase for an agent that closely agrees with the other's phase. We discuss how this synchronization of ensembles broadens the range in which noise-induced synchronization can be used, and how it might be exploited in living systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Energy Calculations Using Formal Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches for validating molecular simulations rely on making software open source and transparent, incorporating unit testing, and generally employing human oversight. We propose an approach that eliminates software errors using formal logic, providing proofs of correctness. We use the Lean theorem prover and programming language to create a rigorous, mathematically verified framework for computing molecular interaction energies. We demonstrate this in LeanLJ, a package of functions, proofs, and code execution software that implements Lennard Jones energy calculations in periodic boundaries. We introduce a strategy that uses polymorphic functions and typeclasses to bridge formal proofs (about idealized Real numbers) and executable programs (over floating point numbers). Execution of LeanLJ matches the current gold standard NIST benchmarks, while providing even stronger guarantees, given LeanLJ's grounding in formal mathematics. This approach can be extended to formally verified molecular simulations, in particular, and formally verified scientific computing software, in general. Keywords: Formal verification, Lean 4, molecular simulations, functional programming.</description>

      <title>Universal or not: Domain walls in inhomogeneous asymmetric exclusion processes with finite resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the domain walls (DW) in an asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with finite resources and a bottleneck. For large values of $\alpha,\,\beta$, which parametrize the entry and exit rates of the TASEP lane, and with {sufficiently large} resources, the DWs are independent of these parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality}. Unusually, these are accompanied by boundary layers in the TASEP lane. These universal DWs replace the maximal current phases in TASEPs. For smaller values of $\alpha,\,\beta$, the DWs depend upon them, and hence are nonuniversal. Our studies show that both universal and nonuniversal DWs can appear for reservoirs with finite or unlimited capacity.</description>

      <title>Mechanical work extraction from an error-prone active dynamic Szilard engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isothermal information engines operate by extracting net work from a single heat bath through measurement and feedback control. In this work, we analyze a realistic active Szilard engine operating on a single active particle by means of steric interaction with an externally controlled mechanical element. In particular, we provide a comprehensive study of how finite measurement accuracy affects the engine's work and power output, as well as the cost of operation. Having established the existence of non-trivial optima for work and power output, we study the dependence of their loci on the measurement error parameters and identify conditions for their positivity under one-shot and cyclic engine operation. By computing a suitably defined information efficiency, we also demonstrate that this engine design allows for the violation of Landauer's bound on the efficiency of information-to-work conversion. Notably, the information efficiency for one-shot operation exhibits a discontinuous transition and a non-monotonic dependence on the measurement precision. Finally, we show that cyclic operation improves information efficiency by harvesting residual mutual information between successive measurements.</description>

      <title>Super Gaussian Self-Consistent method for systems with a two-body Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new kinetic self-consistent method is presented based on the proposed Gaussian Superposition Principle for computation of ensemble averaged observables of a macromolecule interacting via two-body forces. The latter leads to the derivation of a natural functional closure relation for the 3-point distribution functions (DF), thereby truncating a hierarchy of kinetic equations obtained from the original Langevin equation. The resulting Super Gaussian Self-Consistent (SGSC) equations for the 2-point distribution functions acquire a sufficiently tractable integro-differential form. The SGSC theory strives to yield realistic shapes of various distribution functions for any macromolecule with a generic Hamiltonian involving 2-body interaction potentials, both at equilibrium and during kinetics.</description>

      <title>Long-tailed dissipationless hydromechanics: weak thermalization and ergodicity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamic properties of dissipationless Generalized Langevin Equations in the presence of fluid inertial kernels possessing power-law tails, $k(t) \sim t^{-\kappa}$. While for $\kappa &gt;1$ the dynamics is manifestly non ergodic, no thermalization occurs, and particle motion is ballistic, new phenomena arise for $0 &lt; \kappa &lt;1$. In this case, a form of weak thermalization appears in the presence of thermal/hydrodynamic fluctuations and attractive potentials. However, the absence of dissipation clearly emerges once an external constant force is applied: an asymptotic settling velocity cannot be achieved as the expected value of the particle velocity diverges.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Hardness of Posiform Planting Using Random QUBOs for Programmable Quantum Annealer Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Posiform planting is a method for constructing QUBO problems with a single unique planted solution that can be tailored to arbitrary connectivity graphs. In this study we investigate making posiform planted QUBOs computationally harder by fusing many smaller random discrete coefficient spin-glass Ising models, whose global minimum energy is computed classically using classical binary integer programming optimization software, with posiform-planted QUBOs. The single unique ground-state solution of the resulting QUBO problem is the concatenation of (exactly one of) the ground-states of each of the smaller problems. We apply these modified posiform planted QUBOs to the task of benchmarking programmable D-Wave quantum annealers. The proposed method enables generating binary variable combinatorial optimization problems that cover the entire quantum annealing processor hardware graph, have a unique solution, are entirely hardware-graph-native, and can have tunable computational hardness. We benchmark the capabilities of three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealing processors, having from 563 up to 5627 qubits, to sample the optimal unique planted solution of problems generated by our proposed method and compare them against simulated annealing and Gurobi. We find that the D-Wave QPU ground-state sampling success rate does not change with respect to the size of the random QUBOs we employ. Surprisingly, we find that some of these classes of QUBOs are solved at very high success rates at short annealing times compared to longer annealing times for the Zephyr connectivity graph QPUs.</description>

      <title>Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough p such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of 1. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of 0 with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of 1 while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any p step.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Characterization of Sloppiness in Neural Networks: Insights from Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms, hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap Bounds for Quantum Markov Semigroups via Correlation Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from an arbitrary full-rank state of a lattice quantum spin system, we define a "canonical purified Hamiltonian" and characterize its spectral gap in terms of a spatial mixing condition (or correlation decay) of the state. When the state considered is a Gibbs state of a local, commuting Hamiltonian at positive temperature, we show that the spectral gap of the canonical purified Hamiltonian provides a lower bound to the spectral gap of a large class of reversible generators of quantum Markov semigroup, including local and ergodic Davies generators. As an application of our construction, we show that the mixing condition is always satisfied for any finite-range 1D model, as well as by Kitaev's quantum double models.</description>

Abstract: The complex energy landscapes exhibited by frustrated magnetic systems undergoing quantum fluctuations are a challenge to accurately simulate, and thus of great interest for testing diverse qubit platforms in the field of quantum simulation. This study experimentally demonstrates quantum fluctuations lifting the degenerate ground-state manifold of classical magnetic configurations in fullerene Ising models with resonating dimers. The interplay between degeneracy and quantum fluctuations makes these boundary-free models a suitable benchmark for quantum simulators. Indeed, we observe significant performance improvement across generations of superconducting quantum annealers, showing the potential of highly symmetric, frustrated systems for assessing the precision of quantum-simulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Discrete time quasi-crystal in Rydberg atomic chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Remarkable universalities in distributions of dynamical observables in chaotic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of chaotic systems, where rare events play a pivotal role, is essential for understanding complex dynamics due to their sensitivity to initial conditions. Recently, tools from large deviation theory, typically applied in the context of stochastic processes, have been used in the study of chaotic systems. Here, we study dynamical observables, $A = \sum_{n=1}^N g(\textbf{x}_n)$, defined along a chaotic trajectory $\{\textbf{x}_1, \textbf{x}_2, \ldots, \textbf{x}_N\}$. For most choices of $g(\textbf{x})$, $A$ satisfies a central limit theorem: At large sequence size $N \gg 1$, typical fluctuations of $A$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a variance that scales linearly with $N$. Large deviations of $A$ are usually described by the large deviation principle, that is, $P(A) \sim e^{- N I(A/N)}$, where $I(a)$ is the rate function. We find that certain dynamical observables exhibit a remarkable statistical universality: even when constructed with distinct functions $g_1(\textbf{x})$ and $g_2(\textbf{x})$, different observables are described by the same rate function. We provide a physical interpretation for this striking universality by showing that $g_1(\textbf{x})-g_2(\textbf{x})$ belongs to a class of functions that we call ``derived''. Furthermore, we show that if $g(\textbf{x})$ itself is ``derived'', then the distribution of $A$ becomes independent of $N$ in the large-$N$ limit, and is generally non-Gaussian (although it is mirror-symmetric). We demonstrate that the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) for the logistic map is of this derived form, thus providing a simple explanation for some existing results.</description>

      <title>Tunable Hilbert space fragmentation and extended critical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics and a growing structural length scale in supercooled nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics simulation to study the relationship between structure and dynamics in supercooled binary Lennard--Jones nanoparticles over a range of particle sizes. The glass transition temperature of the nanoparticles is found to be significantly lowered relative to the bulk, decreasing as $N^{-1/3}$ with decreasing particle size. This allows the nanoparticles to sample low energy states on the potential energy landscape and we are able to study their relaxation times, measured in terms of the intermediate scattering function, and their structure, measured in terms of locally favoured structures, to low temperatures. Our work shows that the growing relaxation times in the supercooled nanoparticles are coupled with the growth of physical clusters formed from favoured local structures in a way that is well described by the Random First Order Transition entropic droplet model, but with exponents that are dependent on the nanoparticle size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt recent ideas for many-body chaos in nonlinear, Hamiltonian fluids [Murugan \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 124501 (2021)] to revisit the question of the Reynolds number Re dependence of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda\propto{\rm Re}^\alpha$ in fully developed turbulence. The use of such decorrelators allow us to investigate the interplay of the competing effects of viscous dissipation and nonlinearity. We obtain a precise value of $\alpha = 0.59 \pm 0.04$ and show that departure from the Kolmogorov mean field result $\lambda \propto \sqrt{{\rm Re}}$ is a consequence of the intermittent fluctuations in the velocity-gradient tensor. The robustness of our results are further confirmed in a local, dynamical systems model for turbulence.</description>

      <title>Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modelling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from inexpensive bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this Letter, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on experimental studies of the distribution of the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix of open microwave networks with symplectic symmetry and a chaotic wave dynamics. These consist of two geometrically identical subgraphs with unitary symmetry described by complex conjugate Hamiltonians, that are coupled by a pair of bonds. The results are compared to random-matrix theory predictions obtained on the basis of the Heidelberg approach for the scattering matrix of open quantum-chaotic systems. We demonstrate that deviations from random-matrix theory predictions observed in the distributions may be attributed to the fact that the subgraphs are not fully connected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of many nanoscale biological and synthetic systems such as enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of a classical analog of quantum entanglement considering two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse-grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. The coarsening scales range is measured too.</description>

Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). Here, $N$ is the total number of sites and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature or projection length. To tackle this problem, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. We benchmark the developed algorithm by calculating the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The obtained phase diagram including Fermi surface and Goldstone modes validates the correctness of the algorithm. Remarkably, our method shows the high-efficiency with respect to the existing algorithms, while keeping the high computation precision. We proceed to apply this algorithm to explore the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy and particularly its derivative at Gross-Neveu criticality. Our results elucidate that such critical behavior can be quantified by the correlation length exponent.</description>

      <title>Permutation Entropy for the Characterization of the Attractive Hamiltonian Mean-Field Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian Mean-Field (HMF) model is a long-range interaction model that exhibits quasi-stationary states associated with a phase transition. Its quasi-stationary states with a lifetime diverging with the number of particles in the system. These states are characterized by homogeneous or non-homogeneous structures in phase-space. There exists a phase-transition between these states that have been traditionally characterized by the their mean magnetization. However, the magnetization also exhibits fluctuations in time around its mean value, that can be an indicator of the kind of quasi-stationary state. Thus, we want to characterize the quasi-stationary states of the HMF model through the time-series of the magnetization and its fluctuations through a measure of information, i.e. the permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane. Permutation entropy is a measure for characterizing chaotic time series, especially in the presence of dynamic and observational noise, as it is computationally and conceptually simple. For non-homogeneous states, the permutation entropy shows that the HMF model tends towards order, while the magnetizacion fluctuations reveal reduced structures in time. On the contrary, homogeneous states tend to disorder and the structures of the magnetization fluctuations increase as the initial magnetization is larger. In all the study cases of this thesis, the HMF model is characterized by low entropy values but the highest possible complexity value. Thus, the HMF model can be described as a chaotic, deterministic and intermitent system. This aligns with previous studies of the model in the phase space. The results demonstrate that the HMF model can be understood and interpreted from the fluctuations of magnetization using permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated in [A. Dechant, J. Garnier-Brun, S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 167101 (2023)], showing how the decay of correlations in Langevin dynamics is bounded by short-time fluctuations and dissipation. Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the escape dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we derive the most probable escape paths and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean escape time, and show that the feedback accelerates escape by storing finite-time fluctuations thereby lowering the effective energy barrier, and shifting the optimal escape time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic escape trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate escape. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control escape dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</description>

Abstract: Simulating $\mathrm{U(1)}$ quantum gauge theories with spatial dimension greater than one is of great physical significance yet has not been achieved experimentally. Here we propose a simple realization of $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory on triangular lattice Rydberg atom arrays. Within experimentally accessible range, we find that the effective model well simulates various aspects of the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory, such as emergence of topological sectors, incommensurability, and the deconfined Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Our proposal is easy to implement experimentally and exhibits pronounced quantum dynamics compared with previous proposals realizing $\mathrm{U(1)}$ and $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: The "critical brain hypothesis" posits that neural circuitry may be tuned close to a "critical point" or "phase transition" -- a boundary between different operating regimes of the circuit. The renormalization group and theory of critical phenomena explain how systems tuned to a critical point display scale invariance due to fluctuations in activity spanning a wide range of time or spatial scales. In the brain this scale invariance has been hypothesized to have several computational benefits, including increased collective sensitivity to changes in input and robust propagation of information across a circuit. However, our theoretical understanding of critical phenomena in neural circuitry is limited because standard renormalization group methods apply to systems with either highly organized or completely random connections. Connections between neurons lie between these extremes, and may be either excitatory (positive) or inhibitory (negative), but not both. In this work we develop a renormalization group method that applies to models of spiking neural populations with some realistic biological constraints on connectivity, and derive a scaling theory for the statistics of neural activity when the population is tuned to a critical point. We show that the scaling theories differ for models of in vitro versus in vivo circuits -- they belong to different "universality classes" -- and that both may exhibit "anomalous" scaling at a critical balance of inhibition and excitation. We verify our theoretical results on simulations of neural activity data, and discuss how our scaling theory can be further extended and applied to real neural data.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory effect, which quantifies the interconnection between the target system and its environment, correlates states between distinct Hamiltonians. In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall edges beyond the plasma analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the widely used plasma analogy is unreliable at predicting edge properties of quantum Hall states. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between quantum Hall droplets and plasmas (Coulomb gases): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. Consequently, the plasma analogy fails at the edge, except in fine-tuned geometries, as it does not account for the emergent local edge velocity. We quantitatively show how the analogy's failure affects physical quantities, such as fluctuations of local observables and absorption rates in microwave spectroscopy, measurable in both solid-state experiments and quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the R\'enyi-1 Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the R\'enyi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a route toward scalably detecting certain SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The R\'enyi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</description>

      <title>Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta &lt; 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases that survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose glass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</description>
