      <title>Accurate modeling of continuous-time SAT solvers in SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in employing dynamical systems as solvers of NP-complete problems. In this paper, we present accurate implementations of two continuous-time dynamical solvers, known in the literature as analog SAT and digital memcomputing, using advanced numerical integration algorithms of SPICE circuit simulators. For this purpose, we have developed Python scripts that convert Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems into electronic circuits representing the analog SAT and digital memcomputing dynamical systems. Our Python scripts process conjunctive normal form (CNF) files and create netlists that can be directly imported into LTspice. We explore the SPICE implementations of analog SAT and digital memcomputing solvers by applying these to a selected set of problems and present some interesting and potentially useful findings related to digital memcomputing and analog SAT.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Resilient Analog Neuromorphic Chip in Single-Polysilicon CMOS Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analog neuromorphic chips, designers can embed computing primitives in the intrinsic physical properties of devices and circuits, heavily reducing device count and energy consumption, and enabling high parallelism, because all devices are computing simultaneously. Neural network parameters can be stored in local analog non-volatile memories (NVMs), saving the energy required to move data between memory and logic. However, the main drawback of analog sub-threshold electronic circuits is their dramatic temperature sensitivity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a temperature compensation mechanism can be devised to solve this problem. We have designed and fabricated a chip implementing a two-layer analog neural network trained to classify low-resolution images of handwritten digits with a low-cost single-poly complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, using unconventional analog NVMs for weight storage. We demonstrate a temperature-resilient analog neuromorphic chip for image recognition operating between 10$^{\circ}$C and 60$^{\circ}$C without loss of classification accuracy, within 2\% of the corresponding software-based neural network in the whole temperature range.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review article we summarize all experiments claiming quantum computational advantage to date. Our review highlights challenges, loopholes, and refutations appearing in subsequent work to provide a complete picture of the current statuses of these experiments. In addition, we also discuss theoretical computational advantage in example problems such as approximate optimization and recommendation systems. Finally, we review recent experiments in quantum error correction -- the biggest frontier to reach experimental quantum advantage in Shor's algorithm.</description>

      <title>Creation of AI-driven Smart Spaces for Enhanced Indoor Environments -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart spaces are ubiquitous computing environments that integrate diverse sensing and communication technologies to enhance space functionality, optimize energy utilization, and improve user comfort and well-being. The integration of emerging AI methodologies into these environments facilitates the formation of AI-driven smart spaces, which further enhance functionalities of the spaces by enabling advanced applications such as personalized comfort settings, interactive living spaces, and automatization of the space systems, all resulting in enhanced indoor experiences of the users. In this paper, we present a systematic survey of existing research on the foundational components of AI-driven smart spaces, including sensor technologies, data communication protocols, sensor network management and maintenance strategies, as well as the data collection, processing and analytics. Given the pivotal role of AI in establishing AI-powered smart spaces, we explore the opportunities and challenges associated with traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, such as deep learning (DL), and emerging methodologies including large language models (LLMs). Finally, we provide key insights necessary for the development of AI-driven smart spaces, propose future research directions, and sheds light on the path forward.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Problem Solving in Mixed Reality: A Study on Visual Graph Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Problem solving is a composite cognitive process, invoking a number of systems and subsystems, such as perception and memory. Individuals may form collectives to solve a given problem together, in collaboration, especially when complexity is thought to be high. To determine if and when collaborative problem solving is desired, we must quantify collaboration first. For this, we investigate the practical virtue of collaborative problem solving. Using visual graph analysis, we perform a study with 72 participants in two countries and three languages. We compare ad hoc pairs to individuals and nominal pairs, solving two different tasks on graphs in visuospatial mixed reality. The average collaborating pair does not outdo its nominal counterpart, but it does have a significant trade-off against the individual: an ad hoc pair uses 1.46 more time to achieve 4.6 higher accuracy. We also use the concept of task instance complexity to quantify differences in complexity. As task instance complexity increases, these differences largely scale, though with two notable exceptions. With this study we show the importance of using nominal groups as benchmark in collaborative virtual environments research. We conclude that a mixed reality environment does not automatically imply superior collaboration.</description>

      <title>Efficient Motion Sickness Assessment: Recreation of On-Road Driving on a Compact Test Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to engage in other activities during the ride is considered by consumers as one of the key reasons for the adoption of automated vehicles. However, engagement in non-driving activities will provoke occupants' motion sickness, deteriorating their overall comfort and thereby risking acceptance of automated driving. Therefore, it is critical to extend our understanding of motion sickness and unravel the modulating factors that affect it through experiments with participants. Currently, most experiments are conducted on public roads (realistic but not reproducible) or test tracks (feasible with prototype automated vehicles). This research study develops a method to design an optimal path and speed reference to efficiently replicate on-road motion sickness exposure on a small test track. The method uses model predictive control to replicate the longitudinal and lateral accelerations collected from on-road drives on a test track of 70 m by 175 m. A within-subject experiment (47 participants) was conducted comparing the occupants' motion sickness occurrence in test-track and on-road conditions, with the conditions being cross-randomized. The results illustrate no difference and no effect of the condition on the occurrence of the average motion sickness across the participants. Meanwhile, there is an overall correspondence of individual sickness levels between on-road and test-track. This paves the path for the employment of our method for a simpler, safer and more replicable assessment of motion sickness.</description>

      <title>Event-based backpropagation on the neuromorphic platform SpiNNaker2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to replicate the brain's capabilities for energy efficient and parallel information processing, promising a solution to the increasing demand for faster and more efficient computational systems. Efficient training of neural networks on neuromorphic hardware requires the development of training algorithms that retain the sparsity of spike-based communication during training. Here, we report on the first implementation of event-based backpropagation on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic hardware platform. We use EventProp, an algorithm for event-based backpropagation in spiking neural networks (SNNs), to compute exact gradients using sparse communication of error signals between neurons. Our implementation computes multi-layer networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons using discretized versions of the differential equations and their adjoints, and uses event packets to transmit spikes and error signals between network layers. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of batch-parallelized, on-chip training of SNNs using the Yin Yang dataset, and provide an off-chip implementation for efficient prototyping, hyper-parameter search, and hybrid training methods.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01507v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the Electric Grid through Trustable IoT-Coordinated Assets (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</description>

      <title>CUAOA: A Novel CUDA-Accelerated Simulation Framework for the QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which are challenging for classical computers. In the current era, where quantum hardware is constrained by noise and limited qubit availability, simulating the QAOA remains essential for research. However, existing state-of-the-art simulation frameworks suffer from long execution times or lack comprehensive functionality, usability, and versatility, often requiring users to implement essential features themselves. Additionally, these frameworks are primarily restricted to Python, limiting their use in safer and faster languages like Rust, which offer, e.g., advanced parallelization capabilities. In this paper, we develop a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core. The new framework's performance is rigorously benchmarked on the MaxCut problem and compared against the current state-of-the-art general-purpose quantum circuit simulation frameworks Qiskit and Pennylane as well as the specialized QAOA simulation tool QOKit. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime up to multiple orders of magnitude. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/JFLXB/cuaoa and Zenodo.</description>

      <title>SafeDrive: Knowledge- and Data-Driven Risk-Sensitive Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) use Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well in normal driving scenarios. However, ensuring safety in dynamic, high-risk environments and managing safety-critical long-tail events remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose SafeDrive, a knowledge- and data-driven risk-sensitive decision-making framework to enhance AV safety and adaptability. The proposed framework introduces a modular system comprising: (1) a Risk Module for quantifying multi-factor coupled risks involving driver, vehicle, and road interactions; (2) a Memory Module for storing and retrieving typical scenarios to improve adaptability; (3) a LLM-powered Reasoning Module for context-aware safety decision-making; and (4) a Reflection Module for refining decisions through iterative learning. By integrating knowledge-driven insights with adaptive learning mechanisms, the framework ensures robust decision-making under uncertain conditions. Extensive evaluations on real-world traffic datasets, including highways (HighD), intersections (InD), and roundabouts (RounD), validate the framework's ability to enhance decision-making safety (achieving a 100% safety rate), replicate human-like driving behaviors (with decision alignment exceeding 85%), and adapt effectively to unpredictable scenarios. SafeDrive establishes a novel paradigm for integrating knowledge- and data-driven methods, highlighting significant potential to improve safety and adaptability of autonomous driving in high-risk traffic scenarios.

      <description>arXiv:2412.13865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional identity management systems, often centralized, face challenges around privacy, data security, and user control, leaving users vulnerable to data breaches and misuse. This paper explores the potential of using the Arweave network to develop an identity management solution. By harnessing Arweave's permanent storage, our solution offers the users a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework, that uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to allow individuals and other entities to create, own, and manage their digital identities. Further, the solution integrates privacy-preserving technologies, including zero-knowledge proofs and the BBS(+) signature scheme, enabling selective disclosure. This approach ultimately enhances user privacy and supports compliance with European Union legislation and regulatory standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by design.</description>
