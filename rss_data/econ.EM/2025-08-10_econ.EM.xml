      <title>Estimation and Inference in High-Dimensional Panel Data Models with Interactive Fixed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new econometric methods for estimation and inference in high-dimensional panel data models with interactive fixed effects. Our approach can be regarded as a non-trivial extension of the very popular common correlated effects (CCE) approach. Roughly speaking, we proceed as follows: We first construct a projection device to eliminate the unobserved factors from the model by applying a dimensionality reduction transform to the matrix of cross-sectionally averaged covariates. The unknown parameters are then estimated by applying lasso techniques to the projected model. For inference purposes, we derive a desparsified version of our lasso-type estimator. While the original CCE approach is restricted to the low-dimensional case where the number of regressors is small and fixed, our methods can deal with both low- and high-dimensional situations where the number of regressors is large and may even exceed the overall sample size. We derive theory for our estimation and inference methods both in the large-T-case, where the time series length T tends to infinity, and in the small-T-case, where T is a fixed natural number. Specifically, we derive the convergence rate of our estimator and show that its desparsified version is asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions. The theoretical analysis of the paper is complemented by a simulation study and an empirical application to characteristic based asset pricing.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Dynamic Factor Models for High-dimensional Matrix-valued Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of Bayesian matrix dynamic factor models that accommodates time-varying volatility, outliers, and cross-sectional correlation in the idiosyncratic components. For model comparison, we employ an importance-sampling estimator of the marginal likelihood based on the cross-entropy method to determine: (1) the optimal dimension of the factor matrix; (2) whether a vector- or matrix-valued structure is more suitable; and (3) whether an approximate or exact factor model is favored by the data. Through a series of Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy of the factor estimates and the effectiveness of the marginal likelihood estimator in correctly identifying the true model. Applications to macroeconomic and financial datasets illustrate the model's ability to capture key features in matrix-valued time series.</description>

      <title>General Seemingly Unrelated Local Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for the efficient estimation of impulse responses using Local Projections (LPs) with instrumental variables. It accommodates multiple shocks and instruments, accounts for autocorrelation in multi-step forecasts by jointly modeling all LPs as a seemingly unrelated system of equations, defines a flexible yet parsimonious joint prior for impulse responses based on a Gaussian Process, and allows for joint inference about the entire vector of impulse responses. We show via Monte Carlo simulations that our approach delivers more accurate point and uncertainty estimates than standard methods. To address potential misspecification, we propose an optional robustification step based on power posteriors.</description>

      <title>Inference for Treatment Effects Conditional on Generalized Principal Strata using Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for inference for a broad class of treatment effect parameters in a setting of a discrete valued treatment and instrument with a general outcome variable. The class of parameters considered are those that can be expressed as the expectation of a function of the response type conditional on a generalized principal stratum. Here, the response type refers to the vector of potential outcomes and potential treatments, and a generalized principal stratum is a set of possible values for the response type. In addition to instrument exogeneity, the main substantive restriction imposed rules out certain values for the response types in the sense that they are assumed to occur with probability zero. It is shown through a series of examples that this framework includes a wide variety of parameters and assumptions that have been considered in the previous literature. A key result in our analysis is a characterization of the identified set for such parameters under these assumptions in terms of existence of a non-negative solution to linear systems of equations with a special structure. We propose methods for inference exploiting this special structure and recent results in Fang et al. (2023).</description>
