      <title>Investigating Stark MBL with Continuous Unitary Transformation Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ergodicity-to-localization transition in interacting fermion systems subjected to a spatially uniform electric field. For that we employ the recently proposed Tensorflow Equations (TFE), a type of continuous unitary flow equations. This enables us to iteratively determine an approximate diagonal basis of the quantum many-body system. We present improvements to the method, which achieves good accuracy at small to intermediate interaction strengths, even in the absence of an electric field or disorder. Then, we examine two quantities that reveal the fate of Stark MBL in 1D and 2D. First, we investigate the structure of the resulting basis to determine the crossover between ergodic and localized regimes with respect to electric field strength. Second, we simulate long-time dynamics at infinite temperature. Our results in 1D show a localization transition at non-zero field for finite interaction that vanishes with increasing system size leading to localization at infinitesimally small field even in the presence of interactions. In 2D we find less clear signatures of localization and strong finite size effects. We establish that the TFE work accurately up to intermediate times but cannot capture higher order effects in interaction strength that lead to delocalization at longer times in finite-size Stark MBL systems.</description>

      <title>Filtered interspike interval encoding by class II neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of class II neurons, firing frequencies of which are strongly regulated by the inherent neuronal property, have been extensively studied since the formulation of the Hodgkin--Huxley model in 1952. However, how class II neurons process stimulus information and what kind of external information and internal structure firing patterns of neurons represent are vaguely understood in contrast to firing rate coding by class I neurons. Here we show that the FitzHugh--Nagumo class II neuron simultaneously filters inputs based on the input frequency and represent the signal strength by interspike intervals. In this sense, the class II neuron works as an AM processor that passes the information on the carrier and on the temporal waveform of signals.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of macroscopic dynamics by fine-grained disorder in many-species ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large systems are often coarse-grained in order to study their low-dimensional macroscopic dynamics, yet microscopic complexity can in principle disrupt these predictions in many ways. We first consider one form of fine-grained complexity, heterogeneity in the time scales of microscopic dynamics, and show by an algebraic approach that it can stabilize macroscopic degrees of freedom. We then show that this time scale heterogeneity can arise from other forms of complexity, in particular disordered interactions between microscopic variables, and that it can drive the system's coarse-grained dynamics to transition from nonequilibrium attractors to fixed points. These mechanisms are demonstrated in a model of many-species ecosystems, where we find a quasi-decoupling between the low- and high-dimensional facets of the dynamics, interacting only through a key feature of ecological models, the fact that species' dynamical time scales are controlled by their abundances. We conclude that fine-grained disorder may enable a macroscopic equilibrium description of many-species ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Automatic virtual voltage extraction of a 2x2 array of quantum dots with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin qubits in quantum dots are a compelling platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the potential to fabricate dense two-dimensional arrays with nearest neighbour couplings, a requirement to implement the surface code. However, due to the proximity of the surface gate electrodes, cross-coupling capacitances can be substantial, making it difficult to control each quantum dot independently. Increasing the number of quantum dots increases the complexity of the calibration process, which becomes impractical to do heuristically. Inspired by recent demonstrations of industrial-grade silicon quantum dot bilinear arrays, we develop a theoretical framework to mitigate the effect of cross-capacitances in 2x2 arrays of quantum dots and extend it to 2xN and NxN arrays. The method is based on extracting the gradients in gate-voltage space of different charge transitions in multiple two-dimensional charge stability diagrams to determine the system's virtual gates. To automate the process, we train an ensemble of regression models to extract the gradients from a Hough transformation of charge stability diagrams and validate the algorithm on simulated and experimental data of a 2x2 quantum dot array. Our method provides a completely automated tool to mitigate cross-capacitance effects in arrays of QDs which could be utilised to study variability in device electrostatics across large arrays.</description>

      <title>Replica bound for Ising spin glass models in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpolation method is a powerful tool for rigorous analysis of mean-field spin glass models, both with and without dilution. In this study, we show that the interpolation method can be applied to Ising spin glass models in one dimension, such as a one-dimensional chain and a two-leg ladder. In one dimension, the replica symmetric (RS) cavity method is naturally expected to be rigorous for Ising spin glass models. Using the interpolation method, we rigorously prove that the RS cavity method provides lower bounds on the quenched free energies of Ising spin glass models in one dimension at any finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Critical Droplets and Replica Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the notion of critical droplets is central to an understanding of the nature of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising model of a spin glass in arbitrary dimension. Given a specific ground state, suppose the coupling value for a given edge is varied with all other couplings held fixed. Beyond some specific value of the coupling, a droplet will flip leading to a new ground state; we refer to this as the critical droplet for that edge and ground state. We show that the distribution of sizes and energies over all edges for a specific ground state can be used to determine which of the leading scenarios for the spin glass phase is correct. In particular, the existence of low-energy interfaces between incongruent ground states as predicted by replica symmetry breaking is equivalent to the presence of critical droplets whose boundaries comprise a positive fraction of edges in the infinite lattice.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. Based on this framework, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only outperforms traditional bond-orientational order parameters in phase classification tasks but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Quad-cascade picture of electrokinetic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence, ubiquitous in nature and across various systems, exhibits chaotic and intermittent fluctuations in space and time, defying precise prediction. For nearly a century, extensive efforts have been made to uncover the underlying universality and invariant laws from the immense disorder and chaotic nature of turbulence. While the celebrated Kolmogorov -5/3 law stands as a robust cornerstone, it falls short in capturing the diverse scaling behavior exhibited in turbulence influenced by external volume forces, like thermal convection and electrokinetic flows. This study proposes a general framework that couples the fluxes of kinetic energy and scalar variance, culminating in the formulation of a universal conservation law. This framework offers a comprehensive quad-cascade depiction of turbulence, enabling predictions that beyond the limitations of existing models. We illustrate this framework with microfluidic experiments on electrokinetic turbulence, wherein power spectra of concentration and velocity fluctuations exhibit the predicted scaling behaviors, providing remarkable agreement with theory. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the complete cascade process in turbulence driven by external volume forces but also hold promise for insights into other turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>A universal niche geometry governs the response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How ecosystems respond to environmental perturbations is a fundamental question in ecology, made especially challenging due to the strong coupling between species and their environment. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for calculating the steady-state response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations in generalized consumer-resource. Our construction is applicable to a wide class of systems, including models with non-reciprocal interactions, cross-feeding, and non-linear growth/consumption rates. Within our framework, all ecological variables are embedded into four distinct vector spaces and ecological interactions are represented by geometric transformations between these spaces. We show that near a steady state, such geometric transformations directly map environmental perturbations - in resource availability and mortality rates - to shifts in niche structure. We illustrate these ideas in a variety of settings including a minimal model for pH-induced toxicity in bacterial denitrification. We end by discussing the biological implications of our framework. In particular, we show that it is extremely difficult to distinguish cooperative and competitive interactions by measuring species' responses to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Tree networks of real-world data: analysis of efficiency and spatiotemporal scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17829v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work computationally investigates an algorithm that was originally proposed for creating and searching trees of patterns under the assumption that it seeks the most efficient internal representation of the external world, namely a real-world dataset of patterns. The algorithm produces a transition from star graph to regular 1d lattice, passing through irregular scale-invariant trees, under the effect of a single control parameter. The relatively novel information-theoretic tools of the von Neumann entropy and its derivative, the specific heat, together with the recent definition of thermodynamic quantities, such as work and heat, for networks are reviewed and applied to inspect the tree structures produced by the formation protocol. We observe some consistency between the optimal thermodynamic efficiency for networks and the optimal pattern-matching efficiency, defined in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost when the former is measured at the meso-resolution scale involved in the phase transition from star graph to scale-invariant network. We adduce the hypothesis of a richer frequency content at the meso-scale of the self-organized network to explain this observation. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that the system benefits from the vicinity to the mentioned phase transition if it is faced with higher-complexity environments, while it does not when the environment is simpler. A phase portrait of the tree-generating algorithm is provided and multiple phase transitions are identified.</description>

      <title>Weak Poincar\'e Inequalities, Simulated Annealing, and Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of powerful tools to show rapid mixing of Markov chains, via functional inequalities such as Poincar\'e inequalities. In many situations, Markov chains fail to mix rapidly from a worst-case initialization, yet are expected to approximately sample from a random initialization. For example, this occurs if the target distribution has metastable states, small clusters accounting for a vanishing fraction of the mass that are essentially disconnected from the bulk of the measure. Under such conditions, a Poincar\'e inequality cannot hold, necessitating new tools to prove sampling guarantees.
  We develop a framework to analyze simulated annealing, based on establishing so-called weak Poincar\'e inequalities. These inequalities imply mixing from a suitably warm start, and simulated annealing provides a way to chain such warm starts together into a sampling algorithm. We further identify a local-to-global principle to prove weak Poincar\'e inequalities, mirroring the spectral independence and localization schemes frameworks for analyzing mixing times of Markov chains.
  As our main application, we prove that simulated annealing samples from the Gibbs measure of a spherical spin glass for inverse temperatures up to a natural threshold, matching recent algorithms based on algorithmic stochastic localization. This provides the first Markov chain sampling guarantee that holds beyond the uniqueness threshold for spherical spin glasses, where mixing from a worst-case initialization is provably slow due to the presence of metastable states. As an ingredient in our proof, we prove bounds on the operator norm of the covariance matrix of spherical spin glasses in the full replica-symmetric regime.
  Additionally, we resolve a question related to sampling using data-based initializations.</description>
