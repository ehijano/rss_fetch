      <title>Where are the N-Koszul algebras of finite global dimension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of $N$-Koszul graded algebras of finite global dimension has gained lots of attention in recent years, especially in the study of Artin-Schelter regular algebras. While structurally rich and concrete, the only known examples of such algebras are either when $N = 2$, i.e. the algebra is Koszul, or when $N = 3$. Under a mild Hilbert series assumption, we rule out the existence of $N$-Koszul graded algebras of finite global dimension for $N$ not prime. Furthermore, we establish strong restrictions on the global dimension of such algebras. This suggests that perhaps the existence of 3-Koszul algebras with finite global dimension and `nice' Hilbert series is an anomaly.</description>

      <title>Rings whose Non-Invertible Elements are Strongly Nil-Clean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider in-depth and characterize in certain aspects those rings whose non-units are strongly nil-clean in the sense that they are a sum of commuting nilpotent and idempotent. In addition, we examine those rings in which the non-units are uniquely nil-clean in the sense that they are a sum of a nilpotent and an unique idempotent. In fact, we succeeded to prove that these two classes of rings can completely be characterized in terms of already well-studied and fully described sorts of rings.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Morse theory via Homological Perturbation Lemma with two applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalization of the classical killing-contractible-complexes lemma, we present algebraic Morse theory via homological perturbation lemma, in a form more general than existing presentations in the literature. Two-sided Anick resolutions due to E.~Sk\"{o}ldberg are generalised to algebras given by quivers with relations and a minimality criterion is provided as well. Two applications of algebraic Morse theory are presented. It is shown that the Chinese algebra of rank $n\geq 1$ is homologically smooth and of global dimension $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, and the minimal two-sided projective resolution of a Koszul algebra is constructed.</description>

      <title>Finitely and non-finitely related words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algebra is finitely related (or has finite degree) if its term functions are determined by some finite set of finitary relations. Nilpotent monoids built from words, via Rees quotients of free monoids, have been used to exhibit many interesting properties with respect to the finite basis problem. We show that much of this intriguing behaviour extends to the world of finite relatedness by using interlocking patterns called chain, crown, and maelstrom words. In particular, we show that there are large classes of non-finitely related nilpotent monoids that can be used to construct examples of: ascending chains of varieties alternating between finitely and non-finitely related; non-finitely related semigroups whose direct product are finitely related; the addition of an identity element to a non-finitely related semigroup to produce a finitely related semigroup.</description>

      <title>Topological Fukaya category of tagged arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tagged arc on a surface is introduced by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston to study cluster theory on marked surfaces. Given a tagged arc system on a graded marked surface, we define its $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $\mathcal{A}_\infty$-category, generalizing the construction of Haiden, Katzarkov, and Kontsevich for arc systems. When a tagged arc system arises from a non-trivial involution on a marked surface, we show that this $\mathcal{A}_\infty$-category is quasi-isomorphic to the invariant part of the topological Fukaya category under the involution. In particular, this identifies tagged arcs with non-geometric idempotents of Fukaya category.</description>

      <title>The lowest discriminant ideal of central extensions of Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous joint paper with Wu and Yakimov, we gave an explicit description of the lowest discriminant ideal in a Cayley-Hamilton Hopf algebra (H,C,tr) of degree d over an algebraically closed field k, char k $\notin[1, d]$ with basic identity fiber, i.e. all irreducible representations over the kernel of the counit of the central Hopf subalgebra C are one-dimensional. Using results developed in that paper, we compute relevant quantities associated with irreducible representations to explicitly describe the zero set of the lowest discriminant ideal in the group algebra of a central extension of the product of two arbitrary finitely generated Abelian groups by any finite Abelian group under some conditions. Over a fixed maximal ideal of C the representations are tensor products of representations each corresponding to a central extension of a subgroup isomorphic to the product of two cyclic groups of the same order. A description of the orbit of the identity, i.e. the kernel of the counit of C, under winding automorphisms is also given.</description>

      <title>An equivariant BGG correspondence and perfect complexes for extensions by $\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an equivariant extension of Carlsson's BGG correspondence in characteristic two. As an application we classify perfect cochain complexes of $(\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2)\rtimes Q$-representations with four-dimensional total homology for finite groups $Q$ of odd order. We deduce that cochain complexes of finite, free $A_4$-CW complexes with four-dimensional total homology are rigid: They are determined by the degrees of the nonzero homology groups.</description>

      <title>Clonoids between modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clonoids are sets of finitary functions from an algebra $\mathbb{A}$ to an algebra $\mathbb{B}$ that are closed under composition with term functions of $\mathbb{A}$ on the domain side and with term functions of $\mathbb{B}$ on the codomain side. For $\mathbb{A},\mathbb{B}$ (polynomially equivalent to) finite modules we show: If $\mathbb{A},\mathbb{B}$ have coprime order and the congruence lattice of $\mathbb{A}$ is distributive, then there are only finitely many clonoids from $\mathbb{A}$ to $\mathbb{B}$. This is proved by establishing for every natural number $k$ a particular linear equation that all $k$-ary functions from $\mathbb{A}$ to $\mathbb{B}$ satisfy. Else if $\mathbb{A},\mathbb{B}$ do not have coprime order, then there exist infinite ascending chains of clonoids from $\mathbb{A}$ to $\mathbb{B}$ ordered by inclusion. Consequently any extension of $\mathbb{A}$ by $\mathbb{B}$ has countably infinitely many $2$-nilpotent expansions up to term equivalence.</description>

      <title>Abelian gauge-like groups of $L_\infty$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite type degree-wise nilpotent $L_\infty$-algebra, we construct an abelian group that acts on the set of Maurer-Cartan elements of the given $L_\infty$-algebra so that the quotient by this action becomes the moduli space of equivalence classes of Maurer-Cartan elements. Specializing this to degree-wise nilpotent dg Lie algebras, we find that the associated ordinary gauge group of the dg Lie algebra with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff multiplication might be substituted by the underlying additive group. This additive group acts on the Maurer-Cartan elements, and the quotient by this action yields the moduli space of gauge-equivalence classes of Maurer-Cartan elements.</description>

      <title>Centroid and algebraic properties of evolution algebras through graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leitmotiv of this paper is linking algebraic properties of an evolution algebra with combinatorial properties of the (possibly several) graphs that one can associate to the algebra. We link nondegeneracy, zero annihilator, absorption property, von Neumann regularity, and primeness with suitable properties in the associated graph. In the presence of semiprimeness, the property of primeness is equivalent to any associated graph being downward directed. We also provide a description of the prime ideals in an evolution algebra and prove that certain algebraic properties, such as semiprimeness and perfection, can not be characterized in combinatorial terms.
  We describe the centroid of evolution algebras as constant functions along the connected components of its associated graph. The dimension of the centroid of a zero annihilator algebra $A$ agrees with the cardinal of the connected components of any possible graph associated to $A$. This is the combinatorial expression of an algebraic uniqueness property in the decomposition of $A$ as indecomposable algebras with $1$-dimensional centroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $k$ a field of positive characteristic and $X$ a smooth variety over $k$, we compute the Hochschild cohomology of Grothendieck's differential operators on $X$. The answer involves the derived inverse limit of the Frobenius acting on the cohomology of the structure sheaf of $X$.</description>
