      <title>Extreme Shape Coexistence Observed in $^{70}$Co</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of the atomic nucleus is a property which underpins our understanding of nuclear systems, impacts the limits of nuclear existence, and enables probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. Nuclei can adopt a variety of shapes, including spheres, axially deformed spheroids, and pear shapes. In some regions of the nuclear chart where a spherical nucleus would naively be expected, deformed nuclear states can result from collective action of constituent protons and neutrons. In a small subset of nuclei both spherical and deformed nuclear states have been experimentally observed, a phenomenon termed shape coexistence. We present spectroscopic evidence for the coexistence of $J^{\pi}=1+$ spherical and deformed states in $^{70}$Co, separated by less than 275~keV. This close degeneracy of levels with the same $J^{\pi}$ and different shapes demonstrates an extreme example of shape coexistence resulting from the interplay of independent particle motion and collective behavior in highly unstable nuclear systems and identifies the Co isotopes as a transition point between deformed ground states observed in the Cr isotopes and spherical configurations observed in the closed-shell Ni isotopes.</description>

      <title>Search for medium effects using jet axis decorrelation in inclusive jets from PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jet axis decorrelation in inclusive jets is studied using lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV. The jet axis decorrelation is defined as the angular difference between two definitions of the jet axis. It is obtained by applying two recombination schemes on all the constituents of a given jet reconstructed by the anti-\kt sequential algorithm with a distance parameter of $R$ = 0.4. The data set, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.66 nb$^{-1}$, was collected in 2018 with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The jet axis decorrelations are examined across collision centrality selections and intervals of jet transverse momentum. A centrality dependent evolution of the measured distributions is observed, with a progressive narrowing seen in more central events. This narrowing could result from medium-induced modification of the internal jet structure or reflect color charge effects in energy loss. This new measurement probes jet substructure in previously unexplored kinematic domains and show great promise for providing new insights on the color charge dependence of energy loss to jet-quenching models.</description>

      <title>A Precise Determination of $\alpha_s$ from the Heavy Jet Mass Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global fit for $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ is performed on available $e^+e^-$ data for the heavy jet mass distribution. The state-of-the-art theory prediction includes $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ fixed-order results, N$^3$LL$^\prime$ dijet resummation, N$^2$LL Sudakov shoulder resummation, and a first-principles treatment of power corrections in the dijet region. Theoretical correlations are incorporated through a flat random-scan covariance matrix. The global fit results in $0.1145^{+0.0021}_{-0.0019}$, compatible with similar determinations from thrust and $C$-parameter. Dijet resummation is essential for a robust fit, as it engenders insensitivity to the fit-range lower cutoff; without resummation the fit-range sensitivity is overwhelming. In addition, we find evidence for a negative power correction in the trijet region if and only if Sudakov shoulder resummation is included.</description>

      <title>Highly charged isomeric qubits from antiproton annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged synthetic qubits in an ion-trap setup. We identify the qubit transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Initial-state-driven spin correlations in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of spin-polarization phenomena in heavy-ion collisions, it is typically assumed that final-state particles are polarized through thermal vorticity and shear. In this sense, polarization is a final-state effect. Here, we propose a different mechanism. We postulate that the collision of spin-carrying nucleons generates an initial transverse spin density, inducing a net polarization of the QCD fireball along a random direction. If the net spin is conserved throughout the evolution of the fireball, the final-state particles should exhibit measurable polarization. Within a wounded nucleon picture, we estimate that initial-state fluctuations induce a net polarization of $\Lambda$ baryons which is around $1\%$ in central collisions and over $10\%$ in noncentral collisions, significantly exceeding the contributions from thermal vorticity and shear. We introduce a two-particle angular correlation observable designed to reveal initial net-spin fluctuations, and emphasize the main signatures to look for in experiments. We argue that the discovery of these phenomena would have profound implications for nuclear structure and our understanding of spin in relativistic hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dimuon and ditau production in photon-photon collisions at next-to-leading order in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-to-leading-order (NLO) quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections to the production of muon and tau pairs in photon-photon collisions, $\gamma\gamma\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-},\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, are calculated in the equivalent photon approximation. We mostly consider $\gamma\gamma$ processes in ultraperipheral collisions of hadrons at the LHC, but the $\gamma\gamma\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ process in $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collisions at LEP is also discussed. The NLO terms are found to modify the total fiducial cross sections by up to 5%, increasing the tails of the dilepton acoplanarity and transverse momentum distributions, and depleting by up to 15% the yields at high masses, with respect to the leading-order predictions including the very small virtuality of the colliding photons. At the LHC, the calculations obtained with the charge form factor for protons and lead ions including the NLO QED corrections improve the data--theory agreement for all measured differential distributions, and prove an indispensable ingredient for the extraction of precision quantities in photon-photon processes, such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton.</description>

      <title>Baryon stopping and charge deposition in heavy-ion collisions due to gluon saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>

      <title>The Impact of Helium Exposure on the PMTs of the SuperNEMO Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of Hamamatsu 8" photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) of the type used in the SuperNEMO neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment (R5912-MOD), is investigated as a function of exposure to helium (He) gas. Two PMTs were monitored for over a year, one exposed to varying concentrations of He, and the other kept in standard atmospheric conditions as a control. Both PMTs were exposed to light signals generated by a Bi-207 radioactive source that provided consistent large input PMT signals similar to those that are typical of the SuperNEMO experiment. The energy resolution of PMT signals corresponding to 1 MeV energy scale determined from the Bi-207 decay spectrum, shows a negligible degradation with He exposure; however the rate of after-pulsing shows a clear increase with He exposure, which is modelled and compared to diffusion theory. A method for reconstructing the partial pressure of He within the PMT and a method for determining the He breakdown point, are introduced. The implications for long-term SuperNEMO operations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of Tracking Resolutions on $\phi$-Meson Spin Alignment Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of global spin alignment of vector mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can provide unique insights into spin-orbit interactions and vector meson dynamics in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in those collisions. The global spin alignment is measured by the $00^{\rm th}$ coefficient of the spin density matrix, $\rho_{00}$, via the polar angle ($\theta^{*}$) of the decay-daughter momentum in the parent rest frame with respect to the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the collision. Such measurements are affected by the angular and momentum resolutions of the reconstructed tracks in the experiment. Such effects are nontrivial because of kinematic complications caused by the boost to the parent rest frame, and could be important given that the global spin alignment signal is weak. In this paper, we investigate the effects of experimental tracking resolutions on measurements of the $\phi$(1020) meson $\rho_{00}$. We study these effects for two methods of $\rho_{00}$ measurements, the conventional method analyzing the $\phi$-meson yield versus $\cos^2 \theta^*$ and the invariant mass ($m_{\rm inv}$) method utilizing $\langle\cos^2\theta^*\rangle$ versus $m_{\rm inv}$. Using typical resolution values from experiments, we find that the effect of track resolution on $\rho_{00}$ is small, well within typical measurement uncertainties.</description>
