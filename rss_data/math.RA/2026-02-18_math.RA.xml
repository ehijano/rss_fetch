      <title>Semisimplifying Frank Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Frank Lie algebras are simple Lie algebras that only occur over fields of characteristic 3. These come equipped with distinguished inner derivations that make them algebras in the category $\textbf{Rep}(\alpha_3)$. We apply the semisimplification functor to these Frank Lie algebras and obtain modular contact Lie superalgebras.
  We also obtain a class of simple $J$-ternary algebras whose associated Jordan algebras are not simple.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy classes of regular integer matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the theory of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices. Such a matrix is $GL_n({\mathbb Q})$-conjugate to the companion matrix of its characteristic polynomial. But the set of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer matrices with a fixed characteristic polynomial $f$ is usually nontrivial (finite if $f$ has simple roots, infinite if $f$ has multiple roots). It is in 1:1-correspondence to a subsemigroup of a certain quotient semigroup of the commutative semigroup of full lattices in the algebra ${\mathbb Q}[t]/(f)$. In its first part, the paper gives a survey on old and new results on full lattices and orders in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra with unit element and on induced semigroups. In its longer second part, the paper applies this theory to many examples, essentially all cases with $n=2$, many cases with $n=3$ and two cases with arbitrary $n$, the case with $n$ different integer eigenvalues and the case of a single $n\times n$ Jordan block.</description>

      <title>Power monoids and their arithmetic: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-empty finite subsets of a multiplicatively written monoid form a monoid in their own right, and so do the finite subsets that contain the identity element. Partly due to their unusual arithmetic properties, these structures, known as power monoids, have attracted increasing attention in recent years and have in turn stimulated growing interest in new perspectives in factorization theory, better suited to non-cancellative settings. We survey these developments and briefly review some related aspects.</description>

      <title>Certified Reduced-Order Surrogates and Stability Margins in Viscous Incompressible Flow and Fluid--Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(u,p)$ solve the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in a regime in which an energy inequality is available and each constant in that inequality is computable from declared data. We construct a reduced-order model $u_n$ constrained so that its discrete evolution satisfies a certified energy inequality. This certificate yields global-in-time boundedness of the ROM energy and a regime-of-validity test that fails when a stated hypothesis fails.
  It follows that one can attach a computable residual functional $\mathcal{R}_n$ to the ROM trajectory. We prove an a posteriori bound of the form \[ \norm{u-u_n}_{\mathsf{X}(0,T)} \le C(\text{declared data})\,\mathcal{R}_n, \] with $C$ explicit and with $\mathcal{R}_n$ computed from the ROM and the discretization operators. Conversely, if the certificate constraint is relaxed, the bound can fail even for stable full-order dynamics, by an explicit instability mechanism recorded in the text.
  We then derive transition indicators from rigorous energy and enstrophy budgets in simplified geometries. Each indicator is an inequality involving declared quantities such as forcing norms, viscosity, Poincar\'e-type constants, and a computable resolvent surrogate. These inequalities provide thresholds that preclude transition, or else certify the presence of transient growth beyond a stated level.
  Finally, for a class of fluid--structure interaction models, we identify a parameter regime that implies existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. We derive discrete coupled energy estimates that produce computable stability margins. These margins yield explicit constraints on time step and mesh parameters. They are stated as inequalities with constants determined by fluid viscosity, structure stiffness, density ratios, and interface trace bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a length one projective resolution of the trivial module for the groupoid of a semi-saturated partial action (in the sense of Exel) of a free group on a compact Hausdorff and totally disconnected space. As a consequence we obtain an elementary computation of the homology of these groupoids, which include transformation groupoids of free group actions and Deaconu-Renault groupoids of systems $(X,T)$ where $X$ is compact Hausdorff and totally disconnected and $T$ is a local homeomorphism with domain a clopen subset of $X$. We also show that algebra of such a partial action groupoid over a field has global dimension at most $2$ when the space is second countable.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory I: Radical Phase Geometry and Structural Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop Algebraic Phase Theory (APT), an axiomatic framework for extracting intrinsic algebraic structure from phase based analytic data. From minimal admissible phase input we prove a general phase extraction theorem that yields algebraic Phases equipped with functorial defect invariants and a uniquely determined canonical filtration. Finite termination of this filtration forces a structural boundary: any extension compatible with defect control creates new complexity strata.
  These mechanisms are verified in the minimal nontrivial setting of quadratic phase multiplication operators over finite rings with nontrivial Jacobson radical. In this case nilpotent interactions produce a finite filtration of quadratic depth, and no higher degree extension is compatible with the axioms. This identifies the radical quadratic Phase as the minimal example in which defect, filtration, and boundary phenomena occur intrinsically.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory II: The Frobenius Heisenberg Phase and Boundary Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect.
  As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schr\"odinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model.
  The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory III: Structural Quantum Codes over Frobenius Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the quantum component of Algebraic Phase Theory by showing that quantum phase, Weyl noncommutativity, and stabiliser codes arise as unavoidable algebraic consequences of Frobenius duality. Working over finite commutative Frobenius rings, we extract nondegenerate phase pairings, Weyl operator algebras, and quantum stabiliser codes directly from admissible phase data, without assuming Hilbert spaces, analytic inner products, or an externally imposed symplectic structure.
  Within this framework, quantum state spaces appear as minimal carriers of faithful phase action, and stabiliser codes are identified canonically with self-orthogonal submodules under the Frobenius phase pairing. CSS-type constructions arise only as a special splitting case, while general Frobenius rings admit intrinsically non-CSS stabilisers. Nilpotent and torsion structure in the base ring give rise to algebraically protected quantum layers that are invisible to admissible Weyl-type errors.
  These results place quantum stabiliser theory within Algebraic Phase Theory: quantisation emerges as algebraic phase induction rather than analytic completion, and quantum structure is information-complete at the level of algebraic phase relations alone. Throughout, we work over finite Frobenius rings, which are precisely the base rings for which admissible phase data become strongly admissible, and in this regime the full quantum formalism is forced by Frobenius duality.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory IV: Morphisms, Equivalences, and Categorical Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete the foundational architecture of Algebraic Phase Theory by developing a categorical and $2$-categorical framework for algebraic phases. Building on the structural notions introduced in Papers~I-III, we define phase morphisms, equivalence relations, and intrinsic invariants compatible with the canonical filtration and defect stratification.
  For finite, strongly admissible phases we establish strong rigidity theorems: phase morphisms are uniquely determined by their action on rigid cores, and under bounded defect, weak, strong, and Morita-type equivalence all coincide. In particular, finite strongly admissible phases admit no distinct models with the same filtered representation theory. We further show that structural boundaries are invariant under Morita-type equivalence and therefore constitute genuine categorical invariants.
  Algebraic phases, phase morphisms, and filtration-compatible natural transformations form a strict $2$-category in the strongly admissible regime. We also prove that completion defines a reflective localization of this category, with complete phases characterized as universal forced rigidifications.
  Together, these results elevate Algebraic Phase Theory from a collection of algebraic constructions to a categorical framework in which rigidity, equivalence collapse, boundary invariance, and completion arise as intrinsic consequences of phase interaction, finiteness, and admissibility.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory V: Boundary Calculus, Rigidity Islands, and Deformation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general boundary calculus for algebraic phases and use it to formulate an intrinsic and purely structural deformation theory. Structural boundaries are shown to be inevitable, finitely detectable, and canonically stratified by failure type and depth. For each boundary we construct a canonical boundary exact sequence and identify a unique maximal rigid subphase, called a \emph{rigidity island}, that persists beyond global boundary failure.
  Rigidity islands are classified by intrinsic invariants and serve as universal base points for deformation theory. All deformations are boundary-controlled, restrict trivially to rigidity islands, and are governed by boundary quotients, which act as universal obstruction objects. Infinitesimal and higher-order obstructions are finite, stratified by boundary depth, and terminate intrinsically.
  As a consequence, deformation directions are discrete, formal smoothness is equivalent to the vanishing of boundary data, and the moduli of algebraic phases form a stratified discrete groupoid indexed by rigidity islands. No analytic or continuous moduli parameters arise intrinsically.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory VI: Duality, Reconstruction, and Structural Toolkit Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any functorial finite-depth reconstruction framework based on representation theory satisfies a strict dichotomy: it either collapses into a rigid regime or necessarily admits intrinsic structural boundaries. In the non-rigid case, reconstruction is uniquely determined up to canonical boundary collapse, and no boundary-free reconstruction theory with the same formal properties can exist.
  We establish that algebraic phases are \emph{information-complete}. Any phase satisfying the axioms of Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) is uniquely determined, up to intrinsic phase equivalence, by its filtered representation category together with its boundary stratification. Reconstruction is exact on rigidity islands and fails globally only through canonical and unavoidable boundary phenomena.
  We further show that the axioms of APT force a minimal structural toolkit, including canonical finite generation, rigidity--obstruction equivalence, finite-depth boundary detectability, and the existence of universal obstruction objects. These results apply uniformly across all phase models developed in the APT series.
  Taken together, the results of this paper complete the foundational development of Algebraic Phase Theory and position it as a canonical and inevitable reconstruction framework extending classical duality theories beyond rigid and semisimple regimes.</description>

      <title>A Structural Criterion for the Applicability of Algebraic Phase Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) exhibits a striking asymmetry. In certain mathematical and physical domains it enforces rigidity, uniqueness of representation, and collapse of apparent degrees of freedom, while in most analytic or dynamical settings it is provably inapplicable. This paper identifies the structural origin of this selectivity.
  We formulate a necessary and sufficient structural criterion characterising exactly when a nondegenerate Algebraic Phase Theory structure exists. The criterion isolates three conditions: the presence of nondegenerate phase duality, compatibility of admissible dynamics with phase interaction, and finite or terminating defect propagation. These conditions are jointly necessary and sufficient. When they are satisfied, phase theoretic rigidity is forced. When any one fails, no non-artificial phase structure can persist.
  As a consequence, phenomena often regarded as exceptional, including Fourier decomposition, Bethe type exact solvability, rigidity of stabiliser codes, and uniqueness of canonical representations, are revealed to be structural necessities rather than contingent constructions.
  This work positions Algebraic Phase Theory not as a universal modelling framework, but as a theory of structural inevitability. It clarifies both the explanatory power of APT and the precise boundaries of its applicability.</description>

Abstract: Let a reductive group $G$ act on a smooth variety $X$ such that a good quotient $X{/\!\!/}G$ exists. We show that the derived category of a noncommutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of $X{/\!\!/} G$, obtained from a $G$-equivariant vector bundle on $X$, can be embedded in the derived category of the (canonical, stacky) Kirwan resolution of $X{/\!\!/} G$. In fact the embedding can be completed to a semi-orthogonal decomposition in which the other parts are all derived categories of Azumaya algebras over smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>
