      <title>Running Love Numbers and the Effective Field Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive states produce higher derivative corrections to Einstein gravity in the infrared, which are encoded into operators of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity. These EFT operators modify the geometry and affect the tidal properties of black holes, either neutral or charged. A thorough analysis of the perturbative tidal deformation problem leads us to introduce a tidal Green function, which we use to derive two universal formulae that efficiently provide the constant and running Love numbers induced by the EFT. We apply these formulae to determine the tidal response of EFT-corrected non-spinning black holes induced by vector and tensor fields, reproducing existing results where available and deriving new ones. We find that neutral black hole Love numbers run classically for $l\geq 3$ while charged ones run for $l\geq2$. Insights from the Frobenius method and from EFT principles confirm that the Love number renormalization flow is a well-defined physical effect. We find that extremal black holes can have Love numbers much larger than neutral ones, up to ${\cal O}(1)$ within the EFT validity regime, and that the EFT cutoff corresponds to the exponential suppression of the Schwinger effect. We discuss the possibility of probing an Abelian dark sector through gravitational waves, considering a scenario in which dark-charged extremal black holes exist in the present-day Universe.</description>

      <title>The tricritical Ising CFT and conformal bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Orientifolds for F-theory on K3 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study F-theory orientifolds, starting with products of two elliptic curves, but focusing mostly on a family of K3 surfaces, lattice polarized by the rank-17 lattice $\langle 8 \rangle \oplus 2D_8(-1)$, generalizing the family (to which it degenerates) of Kummer surfaces of products of two non-isogenous elliptic curves. After a thorough study of the complex geometry of this family and its elliptic fibrations, we proceed to study real structures on the K3 surfaces in the family which are equivariant with respect to an elliptic fibration. We also study the physics of the associated F-theory orientifolds with a particular focus on the impact of the real structure on the charge spectrum. We also study how these orientifolds degenerate to the case of isotrivial Kummer surface fibrations.</description>

      <title>Note on single-trace EYM amplitudes with MHV configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) configuration, tree-level single-trace Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) amplitude with one and two gravitons have been shown to satisfy a formula where each graviton splits into a pair of collinear gluons. In this paper, we extend this formula to more general cases. We provide a general formula which expresses tree-level single-trace MHV amplitudes in terms of pure gluon amplitudes, where each graviton turns into a pair of collinear gluons.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy and Cauchy-Hadamard Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a purely geometric construction of the so-called twist-field correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory (CFT), derived from conical singularities. This approach provides a purely mathematical interpretation of the seminal results in physics by Cardy and Calabrese on the entanglement entropy of quantum systems. Specifically, we begin by defining CFT partition functions on surfaces with conical singularities, using a ``Cauchy-Hadamard renormalization'' of the Polyakov anomaly integral. Next, we demonstrate that for a branched cover $f:\Sigma_d\to \Sigma$ with $d$ sheets, where the cover inherits the pullback of a smooth metric from the base, a specific ratio of partition functions on the cover to the base transforms under conformal changes of the base metric in the same way as a correlation function of CFT primary fields with specific conformal weights. We also provide a discussion of the physical background and motivation for entanglement entropy, focusing on path integrals and the replica trick, which serves as an introduction to these ideas for a mathematical audience.</description>

      <title>On (de Sitter) Vacua in Heterotic String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterotic toroidal orbifolds are a powerful framework for testing our understanding of string vacua. We review recent advances in heterotic model building, from constructing new vacua to proving novel de Sitter no-go theorems. We also illustrate a potential loophole that could pave the way for the realisation of de Sitter vacua within heterotic string theories. This involves the introduction of non-perturbative, stringy, dilaton-dependent corrections to the K\"ahler potential. We discuss how recently found non-BPS heterotic instantons might provide the necessary corrections.</description>

      <title>MHV leaf amplitudes from parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a dual CFT representation of MHV leaf amplitudes in the large $N$ and semiclassical limit in terms of non-compact parafermions and a single affine Kac-Moody current for $SO(N)$. This representation is consistent with the other 2D CFT realization of 4D leaf amplitudes proposed in the literature, which is based on a dressed Liouville theory. The equivalence between the two CFT descriptions arises from the $H_3^+$ WZW-Liouville correspondence, applied to the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})/U(1)$ coset theory in the spectrally flowed sector.</description>

      <title>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from conserved current, application to massive scalar boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

      <title>Quintessential Implications of the presence of AdS in the Dark Energy sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the implications of incorporating an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua in the Dark Energy (DE) sector using the recent DESI BAO measurements in combination with Planck-2018 CMB, Pantheon-Plus(+SH0ES) supernovae and KiDS weak lensing data. We show that the presence of a {\it Negative Cosmological Constant} ($\Lambda &lt; 0$, nCC) together with an evolving part (modelled by the CPL parametrisation) in DE sector allows a {\it non-phantom} region for the DE in the constrained parameter space consistent with different observational data. This essentially solves the problem of {\it phantom} behaviour in the DE sector which is difficult to obtain through reasonable field theory. The implications nCC in the DE sector for different cosmological tensions are also studied. Our findings highlight the importance of the presence of AdS in the DE sector for theoretical model building, especially in the context of quantum gravity theories, e.g. string theory.</description>

      <title>Probability Distributions of the order parameter of the Ising Model at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>

      <title>Electroweak clouds supported by magnetically charged black holes: Analytic treatment along the existence-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed [R. Gervalle and M. S. Volkov, Phys. Rev. Lett. (2024)] that magnetically charged black holes of the composed Einstein-Weinberg-Salam field theory can support bound-state hairy configurations of electroweak fields. In the present paper we study, using {\it analytical} techniques, the physical and mathematical properties of the supported linearized electroweak fields (spatially regular electroweak 'clouds') in the dimensionless large-mass $\mu\equiv m_{\text{w}} r_+\gg1$ regime of the composed black-hole-field system (here $m_{\text{w}}$ is the mass of the supported W-boson field and $r_+$ is the outer horizon radius of the central supporting black hole). In particular, we derive a remarkably compact formula for the discrete resonance spectrum $\{\mu_k(n)\}_{k=0}^{k=\infty}$ that characterizes the composed black-hole-linearized-field configurations, where the integer $n\equiv 2Pe\in\mathbb{Z}$ characterizes the discrete charge parameter $P$ of the central magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and $e$ is the electron charge. The physical significance of the analytically derived resonant spectrum stems from the fact that, in the dimensionless large-charge $n\gg1$ regime, the fundamental (largest) eigenvalue $\mu_0(n)$ determines the critical existence-line of the composed Einstein-Weinberg-Salam theory, a boundary line that separates hairy magnetic-black-hole-electroweak-field bound-state configurations from bald magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes.</description>

      <title>Cohomological vertex algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of algebraic structures as a higher-dimensional generalization of vertex algebras, which we term cohomological vertex algebras. The formal punctured 1-disk underlying a vertex algebra is replaced by a ring modeling the cohomology of certain schemes such as the formal punctured $n$-disk and the formal 1-disk with doubled origin. The latter scheme leads to the raviolo vertex algebras of Garner &amp; Williams. We prove several structural theorems for cohomological vertex algebras, as well as examine an appropriate Witt-like algebra and its central extensions, giving a definition of a cohomological vertex operator algebra. Using a reconstruction theorem for cohomological vertex algebras, we provide basic examples analogous to their vertex algebra counterparts.</description>

      <title>Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant quantum cohomology possesses the structure of a difference module by shift operators (Seidel representation) of equivariant parameters. Teleman's conjecture suggests that shift operators and equivariant parameters acting on QH_T(X) should be identified, respectively, with the Novikov variables and the quantum connection of the GIT quotient X//T. This can be interpreted as a form of Fourier duality between equivariant quantum cohomology (D-module) of X and quantum cohomology (D-module) of the GIT quotient X//T.
  We introduce the notion of "quantum volume," derived from Givental's path integral over the Floer fundamental cycle, and present a conjectural Fourier duality relationship between the T-equivariant quantum volume of X and the quantum volume of X//T. We also explore the "reduction conjecture," developed in collaboration with Fumihiko Sanda, which expresses the I-function of X//T as a discrete Fourier transform of the equivariant J-function of X. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology to observe toric mirror symmetry and prove a decomposition of quantum cohomology D-modules of projective bundles or blowups.</description>

      <title>Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</description>

Abstract: We present results on the large $N_\text{c}$ scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes. We work in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate quark flavors and run lattice simulations with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 590$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators corresponding to two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. Using L\"uscher's quantization condition, we constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitudes and investigate subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections to the large $N_\text{c}$ limit. For one of the channels, we find indications of a virtual bound state at $N_\text{c}=3$, which may be related to one of the aforementioned exotic states.</description>

      <title>Fractons from covariant higher-rank 3D BF theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the 3D gauge theory of two tensor gauge fields: $a_{\mu\nu}(x)$, which we take symmetric, and $B_{\mu\nu}(x)$, with no symmetry on its indices. The corresponding invariant action is a higher-rank BF-like model, which is first considered from a purely field theoretical point of view, and the propagators with their poles and the degrees of freedom are studied. Once matter is introduced, a fracton behaviour naturally emerges. We show that our theory can be mapped to the low-energy effective field theory describing the Rank-2 Toric Code (R2TC). This relation between our covariant BF-like theory and the R2TC is a higher-rank generalization of the equivalence between the ordinary 3D BF theory and the Kitaev's Toric Code. In the last part of the paper we analyze the case in which the field $B_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is a symmetric tensor. It turns out that the obtained BF-like action can be cast into the sum of two rank-2 Chern-Simons actions, thus generalizing the ordinary abelian case. Therefore, this represents a higher-rank generalization of the ordinary 3D BF theory, which well describes the low-energy physics of quantum spin Hall insulators in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Resumming Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian gravitational waveform expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waveform emitted by a particle moving in a Schwarzschild geometry can be computed, in perturbation theory, as a double series expansion in the limit where distances are large with respect to the size of the horizon, $z=2M/r\ll 1$ (Post-Minkowskian approximation), but small with respect to the gravitational wavelength, $y=2{\rm i} \omega r\ll 1$ (Post-Newtonian approximation). While in the case of bounded systems the two expansions are linked, for scattering processes they describe complementary regions of spacetime. In this paper, we derive all order formulae for those two expansions of the waveform, where the entire dependence on the $y$ or $z$ variables is resummed under the assumption $\omega M\ll 1$. The results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the confluent Heun functions and provide a new derivation of the recently discovered Heun connection formulae. Similar results are found for the non-confluent Heun case. Finally, in the case of circular orbits we compute our formulae at order 30PN and show excellent agreement against solutions obtained via numerical integrations and the MST method.</description>

      <title>Information Metrics and Possible Limitations of Local Information Objectivity in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local information objectivity, that local observers can infer the same information about a model upon exchange of experimental data, is fundamental to science. It is mathematically encoded via Cencov's theorem: the Fisher information metric is the unique metric invariant under sufficient statistics. However, quantum gravity typically violates some of the Cencov assumptions, allowing the Fisher metric and Born rule to vary between observers. We explain these violations, some possible experimental tests, and a new quantum gravity approach based on generally covariant information geometry.</description>

      <title>Modular covariant torus partition functions of dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter integrable dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models are considered on the torus in their simplest physical regimes. A combination of boundary conditions $(h,v)$ is applied in the horizontal and vertical directions with $h,v=0$ and $1$ for periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions respectively. The fugacities of non-contractible and contractible loops are denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively where $\beta$ is simply related to the crossing parameter $\lambda$. At roots of unity, when $\lambda/\pi\in\mathbb Q$, these models are the dense ${\cal LM}(p,p')$ and dilute ${\cal DLM}(p,p')$ logarithmic minimal models with $p,p'$ coprime integers. We conjecture the scaling limits of the transfer matrix traces in the standard modules with $d$ defects and deduce the conformal partition functions ${\cal Z}_{\textrm{dense}}^{(h,v)}(\alpha)$ and ${\cal Z}_{\textrm{dilute}}^{(h,v)}(\alpha)$ using Markov traces. These are expressed in terms of functions ${\cal Z}_{m,m'}(g)$ known from the Coulomb gas arguments of Di Francesco, Saleur and Zuber and subsequently as sesquilinear forms in Verma characters. Crucially, we find that the partition functions are identical for the dense and dilute models. The coincidence of these conformal partition functions provides compelling evidence that, for given $(p,p')$, these dense and dilute theories lie in the same universality class. In root of unity cases with $\alpha=2$, the $(h,v)$ modular covariant partition functions are also expressed as sesquilinear forms in affine $u(1)$ characters involving generalized Bezout conjugates. These also give the modular covariant partition functions for the 6-vertex and Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex models in the corresponding regimes.</description>

      <title>Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tools of quantum and statistical field theories have ben successfully ported to turbulence. Here, we review the key results of turbulence field theory. Thermalized spectrally-truncated Euler equation is described by \textit{equilibrium field theory}, in which the equipartitioned Fourier modes generate zero energy flux. In contrast, modelling of hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity, requires \textit{nonequilibrium field theory}. In HDT, the viscosity is renormalized using field theory that leads to wavenumber-dependent viscosity and energy spectrum. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, we cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are holographic superconformal theories in all dimensions between two and six which allow arbitrary tree-level four-point functions to be fixed by basic consistency conditions. Although Mellin space is usually the most efficient setting for imposing these contraints, four-point functions in two dimensions have thus far been an exception due to their more intricate dependence on the conformal cross-ratios. In this paper, we introduce a simple fix which exploits the relation between a parity-odd conformal block in two dimensions and a parity-even conformal block in four dimensions. We then apply the resulting toolkit to a study of the paradigmatic holographic theory in two dimensions which is the D1-D5 CFT. For correlators involving Kaluza-Klein modes of the tensor multiplet, this analysis reproduces results which were previously obtained using hidden conformal symmetry. With four Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton multiplet, it yields new results including a compact formula for the correlators of all pairwise identical operators,</description>

Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, cosmological constant, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the "crosscap quench", to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Physics on manifolds with exotic differential structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A given topological manifold can sometimes be endowed with inequivalent differential structures. Physically this means that what is meant by a differentiable function (smooth) is simply different for observers using inequivalent differential structures. Specifically, that means that one observer will say that this is a smooth function while the other observer will say it is not smooth. On the other hand, the notion of a continuous function is the same for both, defined by the common topology. In this paper, we examine the import of inequivalent differential structures on the physics of fields obeying the Dirac equation on the 7-sphere. The 7-sphere was the first, celebrated example, found by Milnor, of a topological manifold that can be endowed with a finite number, 28, of inequivalent differential structures. We find that the spectra of these operators are dependent on the choice of differential structure and hence the identical topological manifolds have different physical laws.</description>

      <title>Critical String Theory in a $D=4$ Robertson-Walker Background and the Large Scale Structure of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that $4$-dimensional Robertson-Walker spacetimes can be constructed for which all of the beta functions vanish to leading order, yielding consistent string theory without extra dimensions. We find that there is a unique static solution, which we refer to as an anti-Einstein static universe. The associated stress energy tensor can be interpreted as a perfect fluid with a negative energy density. Interestingly, a fluid with a negative energy density was proposed in [2] as an ad hoc hypothesis to serve as a possible explanation for dark energy and dark matter. Here, such a fluid spontaneously appears by trying to fit string theory into only $4$ dimensions. We can look at perturbations away from the anti-Einstein static universe. This has to be done numerically and we only do it for a few choices of initial conditions. We find that these solutions are very sensitive to the initial conditions and yield a variety of behaviors. We hope that this behavior is rich enough to match cosmological observations by appropriately choosing the initial conditions. One of these solutions that we found is particularly interesting. It has a hubble parameter which is negative in the past (meaning a contracting universe), then a point at which the hubble parameter changes sign, so the universe starts expanding which could be identified with a big bang, after which the hubble parameter continues growing. Throughout all of this time, the acceleration is positive since the Hubble parameter is increasing. Finally, we comment that our result does not contradict [1] as it seems that the authors overlooked the possibility of a purely complex axion field which allows for the Robertson-Walker metrics to make a contribution $c_{RW}\geq 4$ to the central charge. Thus, we can interpret dark matter and dark energy as being parts of a mechanism needed to keep $4$-dimensional string theory consistent.</description>

Abstract: We study one-flavor $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice QCD in ($1+1$) dimensions at zero temperature and finite density using matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. We compute physical observables such as the equation of state, chiral condensate, and quark distribution function as functions of the baryon number density. As a physical implication, we discuss the inhomogeneous phase at nonzero baryon density, where the chiral condensate is inhomogeneous, and baryons form a crystal. We also discuss how the dynamical degrees of freedom change from hadrons to quarks through the formation of quark Fermi seas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $\tfrac{1}{2}$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space ${\mathbf {CP}}^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin $j$ for a generic $j$ (a $2j+1$-state system) is represented instead by a point of a larger space, ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$. Here we study the state of a single angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The special class of states $ | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle \in {\mathbf {CP}}^{2j} $, with spin oriented towards definite spatial directions ${\mathbf n} \in S^2$, i.e., $({\mathbf J}\cdot {\mathbf n} ) \, | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle = j\, |j, {\mathbf n}\rangle $, are found to behave as classical angular momenta, $j \, {\mathbf n}$, in this limit. Vice versa, general spin states in ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$ do not become classical, even at large $j$. We discuss these questions, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach processes, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. Our observations help to clarify better how classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in this context (e.g., with unique trajectories for a particle carrying a large spin), and to make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, more precise.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars and the cosmological constant problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions can play an important role in the cosmological constant problem, allowing the underlying vacuum energy, and therefore the value of the cosmological constant, to change. Deep within the core of neutron stars, the local pressure may be sufficiently high to trigger the QCD phase transition, thus generating a shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The gravitational effects of such a transition should then be imprinted on the properties of the star. Working in the framework of General Relativity, we provide a new model of the stellar interior, allowing for a QCD and a vacuum energy phase transition. We determine the impact of a vacuum energy jump on mass-radius relations, tidal deformability-radius relations, I-Love-Q relations and on the combined tidal deformability measured in neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference of the neutron star equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein's general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Canonical analysis of unimodular Pleba\'nski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the canonical analysis of different versions of unimodular gravity defined in the Pleba\'nski formalism, based on a (generally complex) SO(3) spin connection and set of (self-dual) two-forms. As in the metric formulation of unimodular gravity, one can study either a theory with fixed volume form or work in a parametrised formalism in which the cosmological constant becomes a dynamical field, constrained to be constant by the field equations. In the first case, the Hamiltonian density contains a part which is not constrained to vanish, but rather constrained to be constant, again as in the metric formulation. We also discuss reality conditions and challenges in extracting Lorentzian solutions.</description>

      <title>Boundaries, frames and the issue of physical covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general focus, as well as broader conceptual implications. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. These two goals combine to identify a key open issue: a proper characterization of physical covariance, i.e. covariance across fully physical (as opposed to idealized) reference frames. The broader conceptual implications concern the influence of observers in physics and possible physical limits to objectivity.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network Toolbox for probing dynamics of non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor-network methods are valuable Hamiltonian-simulation methods which enable probing dynamics of strongly-interacting quantum-many-body systems, including gauge theories, without encountering sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state (MPS) ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron (LSH) framework. The LSH framework has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to varying gauge groups [SU(2) and SU(3)], boundary conditions, and in higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in achieving the continuum limit of the static observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1) D and pushing the boundary of dynamical studies. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.</description>
