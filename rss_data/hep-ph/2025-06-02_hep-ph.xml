      <title>Physics beyond the Standard Model with the DSA-2000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Deep Synoptic Array 2000 (DSA-2000) will map the radio sky at $0.7-2$ GHz ($2.9 - 8.3 \, \mu$eV) with unprecedented sensitivity. This will enable searches for dark matter and other physics beyond the Standard Model, of which we study four cases: axions, dark photons, dark matter subhalos and neutrino masses. We forecast DSA-2000's potential to detect axions through two mechanisms in neutron star magnetospheres: photon conversion of axion dark matter and radio emission from axion clouds, developing the first analytical treatment of the latter. We also forecast DSA-2000's sensitivity to discover kinetically mixed dark photons from black hole superradiance, constrain dark matter substructure and fifth forces through pulsar timing, and improve cosmological neutrino mass inference through fast radio burst dispersion measurements. Our analysis indicates that in its planned five year run the DSA-2000 could reach sensitivity to QCD axion parameters, improve current limits on compact dark matter by an order of magnitude, and enhance cosmological weak lensing neutrino mass constraints by a factor of three.</description>

      <title>Can a Dark Inferno Melt Earth's Core?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for dark matter is one of the crucial open problems in both particle physics and cosmology. If dark matter scatters with Standard Model particles, it could accumulate inside the Earth and begin to annihilate, producing heat within the Earth's core. While past work has been done on the effect that this heat would have once it reached the surface, we model the flow of heat through the Earth's core by numerically solving the heat equation to model dark matter's effect on the interior of the planet. We compute how long it takes for the core to come into thermal equilibrium and show that for a wide range of dark matter parameters, a substantial fraction of the inner core would be melted by dark matter annihilation. Our analysis produces new limits on dark matter annihilating in the Earth, points out important new effects that must be considered when studying planetary heating by dark matter, and suggests new dark matter observables that could be searched for in exoplanet populations.</description>

      <title>GPU Implementation of Zippel Method for Feynman Integral Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zippel algorithm performs a rational reconstruction of multivariate polynomials and aims specifically at the sparse case. It is applied in different fields of science, lately becoming an important step in Feynman integral reduction in elementary particle physics. In some cases with multiple variables it might become a bottleneck for the whole evaluation so that different optimizations are required. In this paper we describe how we ported the classical Zippel algorithm together with its balanced version for rational functions to graphical processor units and perform its evaluation on several GPUs.</description>

      <title>Implications of the evidence for direct $\mathbf{CP}$ violation in $D\to \pi^+\pi^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of CP violation in the difference of CP asymmetries between $D\to K^+K^-$ and $D\to \pi^+\pi^-$ has raised a debate whether the observed asymmetries can be regarded as a signal of physics beyond the standard model (SM). In this letter we show that the measured observables for $D\to \pi\pi$ unambiguously imply a very large penguin contribution that is larger than $10\%$ of the amplitude for $D^0\to\pi^+ \pi^-$ at a significance greater than $3.3\sigma$. We present arguments based only on unitarity of re-scattering amplitudes to show that large penguins are unlikely to arise from re-scattering and likely indicate physics beyond the SM. In a model independent approach, we show how a very small contribution from physics beyond the SM with a large weak phase alleviates the problem.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for charged lepton flavour violating processes from residual flavour groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the possible phenomenological impact of residual flavour groups in the charged lepton sector. We consider all possible flavour charge assignments for abelian residual symmetries up to Z8. The allowed flavour structures of operators in Standard Model Effective Field Theory (up to dimension six) lead to distinctive and observable patterns of charged lepton flavour violating processes. We illustrate the relevance of such selection rules displaying the current bounds on and the future sensitivities to the new physics scale. These results demonstrate, in particular, the importance and discriminating power of searches for lepton flavour violating tau lepton decays and muonium to antimuonium conversion.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule study on excited light meson operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the QCD sum rule method to systematically study excited light meson operators and calculate their decay constants. These operators are constructed by explicitly adding one covariant derivative to the quark-antiquark pair. In total, twelve such operators are constructed, among which ten are subjected to detailed numerical analyses. The considered quark contents include $\bar{q}q$, $\bar{q}s$, and $\bar{s}s$ ($q = u/d$), allowing the formation of various $SU(3)$ flavor nonets. For instance, our results support the interpretation that the $a_2(1320)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2^\prime(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ constitute a flavor nonet with quantum numbers $J^{P(C)} = 2^{+(+)}$. In addition, we predict several excited meson states, whose masses and decay constants are determined using the QCD sum rule method.</description>

      <title>Heavy mesons in an effective quark model with a nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of light and heavy mesons in the framework of a model with nonlocal interaction. We start from the Bethe-Salpeter equation, choosing the interaction kernel in a nonlocal form with the Gaussian meson vertex function. We fix the model parameters using electromagnetic and leptonic decay constants. Within this model, we consider the neutral pion transition form factor ${F}_{\pi\gamma }$and apply the model to the transition form factors of heavy pseudoscalar mesons $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$. Finally, we reproduce the radiative decays of the $\rho$-meson and heavy quarkonia.</description>

      <title>Observability of modified threshold behavior near unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of recent references have pointed out that an N-particle system having short-range interactions at S-wave and/or P-wave unitarity can exhibit modified threshold behavior for various reactive processes. But the question of how close to unitarity one must get in order to observe such modifications has not been addressed. The present study quantities this question by treating cases involving 3- or 4-neutrons, at the physical value of the neutron-neutron singlet scattering length a and at artificially altered values. One major conclusion is that the neutron-neutron scattering length is not yet sufficiently large for the 3n or 4n systems to demonstrate the unitarity threshold exponent.</description>

      <title>Could a Primordial Black Hole Explosion Explain the KM3NeT Event?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A black hole is expected to end its lifetime in a cataclysmic runaway burst of Hawking radiation, emitting all Standard Model particles with ultra-high energies. Thus, the explosion of a nearby primordial black hole (PBH) has been proposed as a possible explanation for the $\sim 220$ PeV neutrino-like event recently reported by the KM3NeT collaboration. Assuming a PBH origin, we find that the source would need to lie at a distance of approximately $4 \times 10^{-5}$ pc, i.e., within the Solar System, to produce the observed event. At such proximity, the resulting flux of gamma-rays and cosmic rays would be detectable at Earth. By incorporating the time-dependent field of view of gamma-ray observatories, we show that LHAASO should have recorded on the order of ${\cal O}(10^8)$ events between fourteen and seven hours prior to the KM3NeT detection. IceCube should also have detected about 100 events at the time of the burst. The absence of any such multi-messenger signal, particularly in gamma-ray data, strongly disfavors the interpretation of the KM3-230213A event as arising from evaporation in a minimal four-dimensional Schwarzschild scenario.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize new results on the studies of $\pi\pi$ and $\pi N$ scatterings. They include the finding of a negative-parity nucleon pole with a mass lower than the nucleon mass, and the pole trajectory of $f_0(500)$ with respect to varying pion masses. The results are obtained from model-independent dispersion analyses. We also study the thermal properties of $f_0(500)$ based on the $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model and $N/D$ method.</description>

      <title>Wess-Zumino-Witten Interactions of Axions: Three-Flavor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete Lagrangian describing axion interactions with pseudoscalar and (axial-)vector mesons within the three light-flavor quark framework. This formulation incorporates both the standard chiral Lagrangian and the full Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term. By including instanton effects associated with the anomalous $U(1)_A$ symmetry, we demonstrate that physical observables remain invariant under arbitrary chiral phase rotations of the quark fields. This comprehensive Lagrangian provides a robust and consistent framework for exploring axion phenomenology through its interactions with mesons and gauge bosons. As a demonstration, we compute the decay widths of GeV-scale axions into various mesonic final states for several benchmark axion models.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: The Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger, demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases, systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "ringdown" radiation emitted by oscillating black holes has great scientific potential. By carefully predicting the frequencies and amplitudes of black hole quasinormal modes and comparing them with gravitational-wave data from compact binary mergers we can advance our understanding of the two-body problem in general relativity, verify the predictions of the theory in the regime of strong and dynamical gravitational fields, and search for physics beyond the Standard Model or new gravitational degrees of freedom. We summarize the state of the art in our understanding of black hole quasinormal modes in general relativity and modified gravity, their excitation, and the modeling of ringdown waveforms. We also review the status of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA ringdown observations, data analysis techniques, and the bright prospects of the field in the era of LISA and next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order prediction for the neutrinoless double-beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) of two neutrons$nn \rightarrow ppee$ is the elementary subprocess of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in nuclei. Accurate knowledge of the $nn \rightarrow ppee$ amplitude is required to pin down the short-range contributions in the nuclear matrix elements of the candidate nuclei for large-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches. In this Letter, we report the first next-to-leading-order prediction of the nn \rightarrow ppee amplitude, with Bayesian uncertainty quantification. This is made possible by the development of the relativistic chiral effective field theory, in which no unknown contact term is required up to next-to-leading order. The theory is validated by reproducing in a parameter-free way the available data on the charge independence and charge symmetry breaking contributions in the two-nucleon scattering. The present work makes an essential step towards addressing the uncertainty in the theoretical calculations of the nuclear matrix elements relevant for $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches.</description>

      <title>A White Paper on The Multi-Messenger Science Landscape in India</title>

Abstract: The multi-messenger science using different observational windows to the Universe such as Gravitational Waves (GWs), Electromagnetic Waves (EMs), Cosmic Rays (CRs), and Neutrinos offer an opportunity to study from the scale of a neutron star to cosmological scales over a large cosmic time. At the smallest scales, we can explore the structure of the neutron star and the different energetics involved in the transition of a pre-merger neutron star to a post-merger neutron star. This will open up a window to study the properties of matter in extreme conditions and a guaranteed discovery space. On the other hand, at the largest cosmological scales, multi-messenger observations allow us to study the long-standing problems in physical cosmology related to the Hubble constant, dark matter, and dark energy by mapping the expansion history of the Universe using GW sources. Moreover, the multi-messenger studies of astrophysical systems such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes of different masses, all the way up to a high redshift Universe, will bring insightful understanding into the physical processes associated with them that are inaccessible otherwise. This white paper discusses the key cases in the domain of multi-messenger astronomy and the role of observatories in India which can explore uncharted territories and open discovery spaces in different branches of physics ranging from nuclear physics to astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Relative-phase dependence of dynamically assisted electron-positron pair creation in the superposition of strong oscillating electric-field pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Production of electron-positron pairs in the superposition of oscillating electric-field pulses with largely different frequencies is studied, focussing on the impact of relative phases between the pulses. Various field configurations are considered: superpositions of either two or three pulses of equal duration as well as combinations of a long low-frequency and a short high-frequency pulse. We show that the relative phase of superimposed high-frequency modes can exert a sizeable effect on the total numbers of produced pairs, enhancing them by about 10-30% for the considered field parameters.</description>

      <title>Predictability of quantum observables: Applications in QKD and top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify and optimize the predictability of local observables in bipartite quantum systems by employing the Bayes risk and the inference variance, two measures rooted in statistical learning theory. Specifically, we minimized these quantities when the prediction is improved by an additional quantum system, providing analytical expressions for arbitrary two-qubit states, and showcasing a connection with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. Then, we embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, yielding asymptotically higher secure-key rates than standard BB84 under realistic noise. We applied these results to Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and spin correlation in top-antitop quark pairs from high-energy collisions.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a conventional hollow conductor waveguide filled with a material exhibiting the coexistence of chiral magnetic and anomalous quantum Hall effects supports the propagation of transverse electromagnetic modes within its interior. This simple setup provides an optically feasible and direct method to probe the simultaneous presence of these phenomena, potentially enabling the detection of the axion field in the condensed matter realm.</description>

      <title>Chasing Serendipity: Tackling Transient Sources with Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of ultra-high-energy neutrinos by IceCube marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. Yet, the origin and production mechanisms of these neutrinos remain open questions. With the recent observation of the highest-energy neutrino event to date by the KM3NeT collaboration, transient sources - astrophysical objects that emit particles in brief, localized bursts - have emerged as promising candidates. In this work, we revisit the identification of such sources in IceCube and future neutrino telescopes, focusing on how both the timing and sky localization of the source affect the detection sensitivity. We highlight the crucial role of the source's right ascension in determining the effective area of detectors not located at the poles, such as KM3NeT, and present a framework to consistently account for this dependence. As a case study, we investigate evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) as transient neutrino sources, showing that the detection prospects and localization accuracy are strongly influenced by the PBH's position in the sky. Our results emphasize the complementarity between neutrino and gamma-ray observatories and showcase the potential of a global network of neutrino detectors to identify and localize transient events that might be missed by traditional photon-based instruments.</description>

      <title>The Quintom theory of dark energy after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by suggesting that the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy evolves across $w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. Inspired by this development, we present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications as well as possible extensions. We first trace the historical progression from Einstein's static cosmological constant to modern dynamical dark energy, summarizing recent cosmological constraints that favor an evolving $w(z)$ along time. A key focus is the theoretical no-go theorem for dark energy showing that no single canonical field or perfect fluid model can smoothly cross the $w = -1$ boundary. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintom fields with ordinary matter and the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>New Physics Search at the CEPC: a General Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed next-generation Higgs factory, provides new opportunities to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). With its clean electron-positron collision environment and the ability to collect large samples of Higgs, W, and Z bosons, the CEPC enables precision measurements and searches for new physics. This white paper outlines the CEPC's discovery potential, including studies of exotic decays of the Higgs, Z, and top quarks, dark matter and dark sector phenomena, long-lived particles, supersymmetry, and neutrino-related signatures. Advanced detector technologies and reconstruction techniques, such as one-to-one correspondence reconstruction and jet origin identification, significantly improve sensitivity to rare and weakly interacting processes. The CEPC is particularly well suited to probe the electroweak phase transition and test models of electroweak baryogenesis and dark sector interactions. In addition, global fit analyses highlight the CEPC's complementary role in constraining a wide range of new physics scenarios. These features position the CEPC as a powerful tool for exploring the next frontier in fundamental particle physics in the post-Higgs discovery era.</description>

      <title>Tree-level unitarity constraints on heavy neutral leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) can explain the origin of neutrino masses and oscillations over a wide range of masses. Direct experimental probes of HNLs become unfeasible for masses significantly above the electroweak scale.Consequently, the strongest limits arise from the non-observation of charged lepton flavor-violating processes induced by HNLs at loop level.Counter-intuitively, these bounds tighten as the HNL mass increases, an effect that persists within the perturbative regime.
  This work explores the precise form of these bounds for HNLs with masses well beyond the electroweak scale by analyzing the full matrix of partial waves (tree-level unitarity). At high energies, the HNL model simplifies to a Yukawa theory, allowing unitarity constraints to be expressed in terms of the total Yukawa coupling $\left|Y_{\mathrm{tot}}\right|^2$ involving HNLs, lepton doublets, and the Higgs boson. Processes with $J=0$ and $J=1/2$ yield the well-known result $\left|Y_{\mathrm{tot}}\right|^2 \leq 8\pi$. However, the most stringent result arises from processes with $J = 1$, which is given by $\left|Y_{\mathrm{tot}}\right|^2 \leq 4\pi(\sqrt{5} -1) = 8\pi/\varphi \approx 15.533$, where $\varphi$ is the Golden ratio. These results remain valid provided that the Yukawa matrix has rank 1, a condition approximately satisfied in models with two or three HNLs, with large mixing angles, and radiactively small neutrino masses. Finally, we determine the maximum mass that an HNL can have in the type-I seesaw model while remaining the sole source of neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Updated Determination of Ellis-Jaffe Sum Rules up to $\rm N^{3}LO$ QCD corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the properties of the Ellis-Jaffe Sum Rule (EJSR) by employing the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) approach to address its perturbative part up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\rm N^{3}LO$) QCD contributions. By applying the PMC, we achieve a precise perturbative QCD prediction for the EJSR, free from conventional ambiguities associated with the renormalization scale choices. Considering the presence of the $\alpha_s$ Landau pole near the asymptotic scale, we incorporate the low-energy $\alpha_s$ model based on analytic perturbation theory (APT) to refine the EJSR behavior in the infrared region. By combining the PMC approach with the low-energy APT model, the agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements of EJSR is significantly improved, as evidenced by the reduced discrepancy from $\chi^{2}/d.o. f|_{\rm Conv.}=1.86$ to $\chi^{2}/d.o. f|_{\rm PMC}=1.19$, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Pseudoscalar Higgs and Toponium States at the LHC and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss ways to discriminate at hadron colliders between a quasi-bound toponium state and a pseudoscalar Higgs boson A, as predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model. We apply the discussion to the excess of t tbar threshold events recently observed at the LHC by the CMS collaboration \cite{CMS}, which could in principle be due to either possibility. Working in an effective theory in which only an additional pseudoscalar A boson is present in the spectrum, with a mass above the 2 m_t threshold and a significant coupling to top quarks, we discuss the interference between A production in the dominant gluon-fusion process gg \to A with subsequent A\to t tbar decays, and the QCD continuum background, gg\to t tbar. While this interference is absent in the case of toponium, it is essential for evaluating A production. It is difficult to resolve the peak/dip structure that it generates because of the experimental smearing of the t tbar invariant mass spectrum. However, by comparing the total A production rates for different integration domains of the t tbar invariant mass or, eventually, at different center of mass energies, one may be able to observe its effects. We then discuss additional mechanisms for A production in pp collisions, including loop-induced production in association with the lighter h boson, gg \to hA, and production in association with top-quark pairs, gg/q\bar q \to t tbar. A These mechanisms have small cross sections at the LHC, and their observation will necessitate higher luminosities or collider energies.</description>

Abstract: We compute the production rates for two, three, four and five jets in the hadronic decay of a Higgs boson in its two dominant decay modes to bottom quarks and gluons to third order in the QCD coupling constant. The five-, four- and three-jet rates are obtained from a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculation of Higgs decay to three jets, while the two-jet rate is inferred at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) from the inclusive decay rate. Our results show distinct differences in the dependence of the jet rates on the jet resolution parameter between the two decay modes, supporting the aim of discriminating different Higgs boson decay channels via classic QCD observables.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like particles can couple to Standard Model gluons, electroweak gauge bosons, and massive fermions. A future multi-TeV muon collider provides a favorable environment to probe axion-like particles through multiple production channels, including vector boson fusion via electroweak gauge boson couplings and the top-associated production mediated by direct fermionic couplings. Motivated by the quality issue of the QCD axion, we focus on axion-like particles with masses and decay constants around the TeV scale. We explore how different axion-like particle couplings shape its production and decay modes, revealing a rich and intricate phenomenological landscape.</description>

Abstract: Collisional flavor instabilities, driven by differing neutrino and antineutrino reaction rates, are expected to occur in dense astrophysical environments like supernovae and neutron star mergers, but have yet to be incorporated in large-scale simulations. We derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic state resulting from a homogeneous and isotropic instability, and apply these predictions to two representative conditions from a neutron star merger simulation. We emphasize the importance of using a collision term that allows for both damping of flavor coherence and relaxation back to the classical steady-state. When this classical configuration is collisional-unstable, the resulting asymptotic state reflects a compromise between classical relaxation and flavor conversion, defining a "quantum" equilibrium with nonzero coherence. This analysis highlights the possibility of a trade-off between classical and quantum effects, an important feature with regard to the inclusion of flavor oscillation physics into global simulations.</description>

      <title>Do high redshift QSOs and GRBs corroborate JWST?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the $\Lambda$CDM perspective. Interpreted as a cosmological problem, this necessitates the Planck collaboration underestimating either matter density $\Omega_m$ or physical matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ and remains anomalously large at higher redshifts. We relax the traditional priors by allowing for $\Omega_m &gt; 1$, consistent with negative dark energy density, to locate profile likelihood peaks where possible. While the variation of $\Omega_m$ with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in $\chi^2$ in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to $3.9 \sigma$ and $7.9 \sigma$ tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions. Finally, in the large sample limit, we show that Feldman-Cousins prescription for frequentist confidence intervals in the presence of a boundary (prior) leads to confidence intervals that are bounded above by Wilks' theorem.</description>

      <title>On the number of Regge trajectories for dual amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regge poles connect the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes, analytically continued in spin, to the high-energy limit in momentum space. Dual models are expected to have only Regge poles, and string theory suggests there should be an infinite number of them. In this study, we investigate the number of Regge trajectories these models may have. We prove, based solely on crossing symmetry and unitarity, that meromorphic amplitudes, with or without subtractions, cannot produce a reggeizing amplitude if they contain any finite number of Regge trajectories. We argue that this should exclude the existence of such amplitudes altogether. Additionally, we develop and apply a linear programming dual bootstrap method to exclude these amplitudes directly in momentum space.</description>

      <title>On gauge amplitudes first appearing at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scattering amplitudes in massless non-abelian gauge theory where all outgoing gluons have positive helicity. It has been argued recently by Costello that for a particular fermion representation (8 fundamentals plus one antisymmetric-tensor representation in $SU(N)$) the one-loop amplitudes vanish identically. We show that this vanishing leads to previously-observed identities among one-loop color-ordered partial amplitudes. We then turn to two loops, where Costello has computed the all-plus amplitudes for this theory, as rational functions of the kinematics for any number of gluons using the celestial chiral algebra (CCA) bootstrap. We show that in dimensional regularization, these two-loop amplitudes are not rational, and they are not even finite as $\epsilon\to0$. However, the finite remainder for four gluons agrees with the formula by Costello. In addition, we provide a mass regulator for the infrared-divergent loop integrals; with this regulator, the CCA bootstrap formula is recovered exactly. Finally, we use the CCA bootstrap to compute the double-trace terms in the theory at two loops for an arbitrary number of gluons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects and Bubble Wall Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as a quantum frictional effect on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe. Consequently, this study validates the consistency of our method for constructing meaningful physical quantities in quantum inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

      <title>Updated determination of light-cone distribution amplitudes of octet baryons in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present updated results on the wave function normalization constants and the first moments of the light cone distribution amplitudes for the lowest-lying baryon octet. The analysis is carried out on a large number of $n_f=2+1$ lattice gauge ensembles, including ensembles at physical pion (and kaon) masses. These are spread across five different lattice spacings, enabling a controlled continuum limit. The main differences with respect to our earlier work are the use of two-loop conversion factors to an $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-like scheme and of an updated set of low-energy constants in the parametrization of the quark mass dependence. As a byproduct, for the first time, the anomalous dimensions for local three-quark operators with one derivative are obtained.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Probes of Non-Standard Thermal Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves propagate almost unimpeded from the moment they are generated to the present epoch. Nevertheless, they are subject to convolution with a non-trivial transfer function. Within the standard thermal history, shifts in the temperature-redshift relation combine with damping effects by free streaming neutrinos to non-trivially process different wavelengths during radiation domination, with subsequently negligible effects at later times. Presuming a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum, one obtains a characteristic late time spectrum, deviations from which would indicate departures from the standard thermal history. Given the paucity of probes of the early universe physics before nucleosynthesis, it is useful to classify how deviations from the standard thermal history of the early universe can be constrained from observations of the late time stochastic background. The late time spectral density has a plateau at high frequencies that can in principle be significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to the standard thermal history depending on the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination, imprinting additional features from bursts of entropy production, and additional damping at intermediate scales via anisotropic stress production. In this paper, we survey phenomenologically motivated scenarios of early matter domination, kination, and late time decaying particles as representative non-standard thermal histories, elaborate on their late time stochastic background, and discuss constraints on different model scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pretrain the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression as a Sustainable Data-driven Background Estimate Method at the (HL)-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we evaluate the performance of a data-driven background estimate method based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). A realistic background spectrum from a search conducted by CMS is considered, where a large sub-region below the trigger threshold is included. It is found that the $L_2$ regularisation can serve as a set of hyperparameters and control the overall modelling performance to satisfy common standards established by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition, we show the robustness of this method against increasing luminosity via pseudo-experiments matching the expected luminosity at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). While traditional methods relying on empirical functions have been challenged during LHC Run 2 already, a GPR-based technique can offer a solution that is valid through the entire lifetime of the (HL)-LHC.</description>
