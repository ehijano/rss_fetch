      <title>Large, defect-free FCC colloidal crystals under microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report the results of microgravity experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) to study crystallized, metastable colloidal liquids in the region of the hard sphere phase diagram that has been found to be glassy on Earth. Using confocal microscopy, we observed the self-assembly of high density, three-dimensional colloidal crystals from micron-size hard spheres suspended within a fluid medium. The largest face-centered cubic (FCC) phase measured 27 x 1.5 x 0.15 mm. From a practical aspect, the fact that a single, topological defect-free FCC colloidal crystal can be grown in microgravity and the crystal returned from orbit suggests new routes for manufacturing colloidal devices, particularly optical elements in space.</description>

      <title>Lock-Key Microfluidics: Simulating Nematic Colloid Advection along Wavy-Walled Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystalline media mediate interactions between suspended particles and confining geometries, which not only has potential to guide patterning and bottom-up colloidal assembly, but can also control colloidal migration in microfluidic devices. However, simulating such dynamics is challenging because nemato-elasticity, diffusivity and hydrodynamic interactions must all be accounted for within complex boundaries. We model the advection of colloids dispersed in flowing and fluctuating nematic fluids confined within 2D wavy channels. A lock-key mechanism between colloids and troughs is found to be stronger for planar anchoring compared to homeotropic anchoring due to the relative location of the colloid-associated defects. Sufficiently large amplitudes result in stick-slip trajectories and even permanent locking of colloids in place. These results demonstrate that wavy walls not only have potential to direct colloids to specific docking sites but also to control site-specific resting duration and intermittent elution.</description>

      <title>The Ideal Glass and the Ideal Disk Packing in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal glass, a disordered system of particles with zero configurational entropy, cannot be realized through thermal processes. Nevertheless, we present a method for constructing ideal jammed packings of soft spheres, and thus the zero temperature ideal glass, in two dimensions. In line with the predicted properties, these critically jammed packings have high bulk and shear moduli as well as an anomalously high density. While the absence of pressure scaling in the shear moduli of crystalline materials is often attributed to the ordered nature of the particles, we show for the first time that disordered ideal packings also have this feature. We also find that the density of states avoids the low frequency power law scaling famously found in most amorphous materials. Finally, these configurations display hyperuniformity. In addition to resolving a long-standing mystery, this methodology represents a valuable shortcut in the generation of well-equilibrated glassy systems. The creation of such an ideal packing makes possible a complete exploration and explanation of two dimensional jammed and glassy systems.</description>

      <title>Accessing the Free Expansion and Melting of a Crystalline Drop of Charged Colloidal Spheres in a Particle-Free Environment by Optical Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address crystals of non-attractive colloidal spheres freely expanding into particle-free environ-ments and melting during dilution. This problem has been studied in two dimensions, both numeri-cally and in experiments on colloidal model crystals. Here, we place three-dimensional drops of aqueous colloidal charged sphere suspensions in a colloid-free, deionized aqueous environment. Initially in a shear-molten state, they rapidly crystallize to a fine-grained polycrystalline material of body centred cubic structure. They stabilize their spherical shape within a few seconds. We over-come the challenges provided by drop turbidity and use a combination of optical methods to follow the drop evolution. The crystal ball shows a nearly fourfold increase of the volume followed by slow shrinkage due to melting, which is nearly linear in time. Exploiting coherent multiple-scattering by (110) Bragg reflecting crystals, time-dependent density profiles were recorded within the drop interior. These show a continuously flattening radial density gradient. Our experimental situation is close to the isothermal three-dimensional expansion of a spherical crystallite as described by a theoretical model based on dynamical density functional theory. We obtain an overall good agree-ment of measured and calculated expansion curves at most probed densities. We anticipate that our study opens novel experimental and theoretical access to a long-standing condensed matter issue.</description>

      <title>Optimal run-and-tumble in slit-like confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble is a basic model of persistent motion and a motility strategy widespread in micro-organisms and individual cells. In many natural settings, movement occurs in the presence of confinement. While accumulation at the surface has been extensively studied, the transport parallel to the boundary has received less attention. We consider a run-and-tumble particle confined inside a slit, where motion in the bulk alternates with intermittent sojourns at the wall. We first propose a discrete-direction model that is fully tractable and obtain the exact diffusion coefficient characterizing the long-time exploration of the slit. We then use numerical simulations to show that with an adequate choice of parameters, our analytical prediction provides a useful approximation for the diffusion coefficient of run-and-tumble with continuous direction. Finally, we identify the conditions that maximize diffusion within the slit and discuss the optimal mean run time. For swimming bacteria, we find that the optimum is typically reached when the mean run length is comparable to the confinement size.</description>

      <title>Aggregation in Dilute Aqueous Solutions of Hydroxypropyl Cellulose with Salt Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal behaviors of hydroxypropyl cellulose dilute aqueous solutions with impurities of Group I alkali metal ions (Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs chlorides) has been studied by means of static and dynamic light scattering measurements. From the experimental data, it follows that at temperatures above the LCST and in the presence of salts, there arise supramolecular associates (clusters) that are several times larger than the wavelength of visible light. It is shown that the observed intensity of backscattered light is described by the tangent plane approximation and the Mie scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Active particles knead three-dimensional gels into open crumbs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal gels are prime examples of functional materials exhibiting disordered, amorphous, yet meta-stable forms. They maintain stability through short-range attractive forces and their material properties are tunable by external forces. Combining persistent homology analyses and simulations of three-dimensional colloidal gels doped with active particles, we reveal novel dynamically evolving structures of colloidal gels. Specifically, we show that the local injection of energy by active dopants can lead to highly porous, yet compact gel structures that can significantly affect the transport of active particles within the modified colloidal gel. We further show the substantially distinct structural behaviour between active doping of 2D and 3D systems by revealing how passive interfaces play a topologically different role in interacting with active particles in two and three dimensions. The results open the door to an unexplored prospect of forming a wide variety of compact but highly heterogeneous and percolated porous media through active doping of 3D passive matter, with diverse implications in designing new functional materials to active ground remediation.</description>

      <title>Metastability of a periodic network of threads: what are the shapes of a knitted fabric ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knitted fabrics are metamaterials with remarkable mechanical properties, such as extreme deformability and multiple history-dependent rest shapes. This letter shows that those properties may stem from a continuous set of metastable states for a mechanically relaxed fabric, evidenced through experiments, numerical simulations and analytical developments. Those states arise from the frictional contact forces acting in the braid zone where the threads interlace and follow a line in the configuration space accurately described by a 2D-elastica model. The friction coefficient sets a terminal point along this line, and the continuous set of relaxed states is obtained by varying the braid inclination while contact forces remain on the friction cone.</description>

      <title>Artificial Chemotaxis under Electrodiffusiophoresis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusiophoretic motion induced by gradients of dissolved species has enabled the manipulation of colloids over large distances, spanning hundreds of microns. Nonetheless, studies have primarily focused on simple geometries that feature 1D gradients of solutes generated by reactions or selective dissolution. Thus, our understanding of 3D diffusiophoresis remains elusive despite its importance in wide-ranging scenarios, such as cellular transport and nanofluidics. Herein, we present a strategy to generate 3D chemical gradients under electric fields. In this approach, faradaic reactions at electrodes induce global pH gradients that drive long-range transport through electrodiffusiophoresis. Simultaneously, the electric field induces local pH gradients by driving the particle's double layer far from equilibrium. As a result, while global pH gradients lead to 2D focusing away from electrodes, local pH gradients induce aggregation in the third dimension. Resulting interparticle interactions display a strong dependence on surface chemistry, and particle size. Furthermore, pH gradients can be readily tuned by adjusting the voltage and frequency of the electric field. For large P\'eclet numbers, we observed a chemotactic-like collapse. Remarkably, such collapse occurs without reactions at a particle's surface. By mixing particles with different sizes, we also demonstrate the emergence of non-reciprocal interactions through experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations. These findings suggest a wide array of possibilities for the dynamic assembly of materials and the design of responsive matter.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of confined cell migration -- modeling and inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motility of eukaryotic cells is strongly influenced by their environment, with confined cells often developing qualitatively different motility patterns from those migrating on simple two-dimensional substrates. Recent experiments, coupled with data-driven methods to extract a cell's equation of motion, showed that cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells persistently hop in a limit cycle when placed on two-state adhesive micropatterns (two large squares connected by a narrow bridge), while they remain stationary on average in rectangular confinements. In contrast, healthy MCF10A cells migrating on the two-state micropattern are bistable, i.e., they settle into either basin on average with only noise-induced hops between the two states. We can capture all these behaviors with a single computational phase field model of a crawling cell, under the assumption that contact with non-adhesive substrate inhibits the cell front. Our model predicts that larger and softer cells are more likely to persistently hop, while smaller and stiffer cells are more likely to be bistable. Other key factors controlling cell migration are the frequency of protrusions and their magnitude of noise. Our results show that relatively simple assumptions about how cells sense their geometry can explain a wide variety of different cell behaviors, and show the power of data-driven approaches to characterize both experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Active particle motion in Poiseuille flow through rectangular channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a point-like active particle suspended in fluid flow through a straight channel. For this particle-fluid system, we derive a constant of motion for a general unidirectional fluid flow, and apply it to an approximation of Poiseuille flow through rectangular cross-sections. For a given rectangular cross-section, this results in a $4$D nonlinear conservative dynamical system with one constant of motion and a dimensionless parameter as the ratio of maximum flow speed to intrinsic active particle speed. We observe a diverse set of active particle trajectories with variations in system parameters and initial conditions which we classify into different types of swinging, trapping, tumbling and wandering motion. Regular (periodic/quasiperiodic) motion as well as chaotic active particle motion are observed for these trajectories and quantified using largest Lyapunov exponents. We explore the transition to chaotic motion using Poincar\'e maps and show ``sticky" chaotic tumbling trajectories that have long transients near a periodic state. Outcomes of this work may have implications for dynamics of natural and artificial microswimmers in experimental microfluidic channels that typically have rectangular cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Towards resolving bedload flux variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bedload transport occurs when a bed composed of sedimentary grains becomes mobile in response to the shearing by a flow of liquid. It shapes the landscapes of Earth and other planetary bodies by promoting the formation and growth of various multiscale geological features. Estimating the rate at which such processes take place requires accurate bedload flux predictions. However, even for highly idealized conditions in the laboratory, study-to-study variability of reported bedload flux measurements borders an order of magnitude. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, typically empirical methods of determining the transport-driving bed shear stress, especially for very narrow or shallow channel flows, and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive a non-empirical method of bed shear stress determination and apply it to a number of independent grain-shape-controlled data sets, based on well-controlled experiments and CFD-DEM simulations, for a very diverse range of transport conditions. An existing physical bedload model, here generalized to account for grain shape variability, predicts almost all these data within a factor of 1.3, whereas a prominent alternative model (Deal et al., Nature 613, 298-302, 2023) seems falsified.</description>

      <title>Active Carpets in floating viscous films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's aquatic environments are inherently stratified layered systems where interfaces between layers serve as ecological niches for microbial swimmers, forming colonies known as Active Carpet (AC). Previous theoretical studies have explored the hydrodynamic fluctuations exerted by ACs in semi-infinite fluid media, demonstrating their capability to enhance thermal diffusion and mass transport in aquatic systems. Yet, little is understood about the fluid dynamics and impact of ACs residing in confined layered environments, like slicks floating on water bodies. In this study, we report novel solutions for the hydrodynamic fluctuations induced by ACs geometrically confined between a free surface and a fluid-fluid interface characterized by a jump in fluid viscosity. Combining theory and numerical experiments, we investigate the topology of the biogenic hydrodynamic fluctuations in a confined, thin fluid environment. We reveal that within this thin layer, ACs gives shape to three characteristic regions: Region I is the closest zone to the AC and the fluid-fluid interface, where hydrodynamic fluctuations are dominantly vertical; Region II is further up from the AC and is characterized by isotropic hydrodynamic fluctuations; Region III is the furthest region, near the free surface and is dominated by horizontal flow fluctuations. We demonstrate that the extent of these regions depends strongly on the degree of confinement, i.e. the layer thickness and the strength of the viscosity jump. Lastly, we show that confinement fosters the emergence of large-scale flow structures within the layer housing the ACs--not previously reported. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay between confinement and hydrodynamics in floating viscous film biological systems, providing valuable insights with implications spanning from ecological conservation to bio-inspired engineering.</description>

Abstract: Depinning transitions occur when a threshold force must be applied to drive an otherwise immobile system. For the depinning of colloidal particles from a corrugated landscape, we show how active noise due to self-propulsion impacts the nature of this transition, depending on the speed and the dimensionality $d$ of rotational Brownian motion: the drift velocity exhibits the critical exponent 1/2 for quickly reorienting particles, which changes to $d/2$ for slow ones; in between these limits, the drift varies superexponentially. Different giant diffusion phenomena emerge in the two regimes. Our predictions extend to systems with a saddle-node bifurcation in the presence of a bounded noise. Moreover, our findings suggest that nonlinear responses are a sensitive probe of nonequilibrium behavior in active matter.</description>

      <title>Active fractal networks with stochastic force monopoles and force dipoles unravel subdiffusion of chromosomal loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the well-known fractal packing of chromatin, we study the Rouse-type dynamics of elastic fractal networks with embedded, stochastically driven, active force monopoles and force dipoles that are temporally correlated. We compute, analytically -- using a general theoretical framework -- and via Langevin dynamics simulations, the mean square displacement (MSD) of a network bead. Following a short-time superdiffusive behavior, force monopoles yield anomalous subdiffusion with an exponent identical to that of the thermal system. In contrast, force dipoles do not induce subdiffusion, and the early superdiffusive MSD crosses over to a relatively small, system-size-independent saturation value. In addition, we find that force dipoles may lead to ``crawling" rotational motion of the whole network, reminiscent of that found for triangular micro-swimmers and consistent with general theories of the rotation of deformable bodies. Moreover, force dipoles lead to network collapse beyond a critical force strength, which persists with increasing system size, signifying a true first-order dynamical phase transition. We apply our results to the motion of chromosomal loci in bacteria and yeast cells' chromatin, where anomalous sub-diffusion, MSD$\sim t^{\nu}$ with $\nu\simeq 0.4$, were found in both normal and ATP-depleted cells, albeit with different apparent diffusion coefficients. We show that the combination of thermal, monopolar, and dipolar forces in chromatin is typically dominated by the active monopolar and thermal forces, explaining the observed normal cells vs the ATP-depleted cells behavior.</description>

Abstract: The existence of a crumpled phase for self-avoiding elastic surfaces was postulated more than three decades ago using simple Flory-like scaling arguments. Despite much effort, its stability in a microscopic environment has been the subject of much debate. In this paper we show how a crumpled phase develops reliably and consistently upon subjecting a thin spherical shell to active fluctuations. We find a master curve describing how the relative volume of a shell changes with the strength of the active forces, that applies for every shell independent of size and elastic constants. Furthermore, we extract a general expression for the onset active force beyond which a shell begins to crumple. Finally, we calculate how the size exponent varies along the crumpling curve.</description>

Abstract: We argue that nucleation of brittle cracks in initially flawless soft elastic solids is preceded by a nonlinear elastic instability, which cannot be captured without accounting for geometrical precise description of finite elastic deformation. As a prototypical problem we consider a homogeneous elastic body subjected to tension and assume that it is weakened by the presence of a free surface which then serves as a site of crack nucleation. We show that in this maximally simplified setting, brittle fracture emerges from a symmetry breaking elastic instability activated by softening and involving large elastic rotations. The implied bifurcation of the homogeneous elastic equilibrium is highly unconventional for nonlinear elasticity as it exhibits an extraordinary sensitivity to geometry, reminiscent of the transition to turbulence in fluids. We trace the post-bifurcational development of this instability beyond the limits of applicability of scale free continuum elasticity and use a phase-field approach to capture the scale dependent sub-continuum strain localization, signaling the formation of actual cracks.</description>

      <title>Motile bacteria crossing liquid-liquid interfaces</title>

Abstract: Real-life bacteria often swim in complex fluids, but our understanding of the interactions between bacteria and complex surroundings is still evolving. In this work, rod-like \textit{Bacillus subtilis} swims in a quasi-2D environment with aqueous liquid-liquid interfaces, \textit{i.e.}, the isotropic-nematic coexistence phase of an aqueous chromonic liquid crystal. Focusing on the bacteria motion near and at the liquid-liquid interfaces, we collect and quantify bacterial trajectories ranging across the isotropic to the nematic phase. Despite its small magnitude, the interfacial tension of the order of 10 $\mathrm{\mu N/m}$ at the isotropic-nematic interface justifies our observations that bacteria swimming more perpendicular to the interface have a higher probability of crossing the interface. Our force-balance model, considering the interfacial tension, further predicts how the length and speed of the bacteria affect their crossing behaviors. We also find, as soon as the bacteria cross the interface and enter the nematic phase, they wiggle less, but faster, and that this occurs as the flagellar bundles aggregate within the nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Generating High-Precision Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics Simulations to Study Chemical Reaction Mechanisms using Molecular Configuration Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00499</link>

Abstract: Theoretical studies on chemical reaction mechanisms have been crucial in organic chemistry. Traditionally, calculating the manually constructed molecular conformations of transition states for chemical reactions using quantum chemical calculations is the most commonly used method. However, this way is heavily dependent on individual experience and chemical intuition. In our previous study, we proposed a research paradigm that uses enhanced sampling in molecular dynamics simulations to study chemical reactions. This approach can directly simulate the entire process of a chemical reaction. However, the computational speed limits the use of high-precision potential energy functions for simulations. To address this issue, we present a scheme for training high-precision force fields for molecular modeling using a previously developed graph-neural-network-based molecular model, molecular configuration transformer. This potential energy function allows for highly accurate simulations at a low computational cost, leading to more precise calculations of the mechanism of chemical reactions. We applied this approach to study a Claisen rearrangement reaction and a Carbonyl insertion reaction catalyzed by Manganese.</description>
