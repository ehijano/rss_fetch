      <title>Bias-Reduced Estimation of Structural Equation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-sample bias is a pervasive challenge in the estimation of structural equation models (SEMs), especially when sample sizes are small or measurement reliability is low. A range of methods have been proposed to improve finite-sample bias in the SEM literature, ranging from analytic bias corrections to resampling-based techniques, with each carrying trade-offs in scope, computational burden, and statistical performance. We apply the reduced-bias M-estimation framework (RBM, Kosmidis &amp; Lunardon, 2024, J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol.) to SEMs. The RBM framework is attractive as it requires only first- and second-order derivatives of the log-likelihood, which renders it both straightforward to implement, and computationally more efficient compared to resampling-based alternatives such as bootstrap and jackknife. It is also robust to departures from modelling assumptions. Through extensive simulations studies under a range of experimental conditions, we illustrate that RBM estimators consistently reduce mean bias in the estimation of SEMs without inflating mean squared error. They also deliver improvements in both median bias and inference relative to maximum likelihood estimators, while maintaining robustness under non-normality. Our findings suggest that RBM offers a promising, practical, and broadly applicable tool for mitigating bias in the estimation of SEMs, particularly in small-sample research contexts.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification of tumor growth modeled by a parametric semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the application of a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to a class of semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion partial differential equations used to model tumor growth. Mathematical models of tumor growth are largely phenomenological in nature, capturing infiltration of the tumor into surrounding healthy tissue, proliferation of the existing tumor, and patient response to therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerable inter-patient variability, inherent heterogeneity of the disease, sparse and noisy data collection, and model inadequacy all contribute to significant uncertainty in the model parameters. It is crucial that these uncertainties can be efficiently propagated through the model to compute quantities of interest (QoIs), which in turn may be used to inform clinical decisions. We show that QMC methods can be successful in computing expectations of meaningful QoIs. Well-posedness results are developed for the model and used to show a theoretical error bound for the case of uniform random fields. The theoretical linear error rate, which is superior to that of standard Monte Carlo, is verified numerically. Encouraging computational results are also provided for lognormal random fields, prompting further theoretical development.</description>

      <title>An Order of Magnitude Time Complexity Reduction for Gaussian Graphical Model Posterior Sampling Using a Reverse Telescoping Block Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fully Bayesian posterior estimation and uncertainty quantification in undirected Gaussian graphical models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) under recently-developed element-wise graphical priors, such as the graphical horseshoe. Unlike the conjugate Wishart family, these priors are non-conjugate; but have the advantage that they naturally allow one to encode a prior belief of sparsity in the off-diagonal elements of the precision matrix, without imposing a structure on the entire matrix. Unfortunately, for a graph with $p$ nodes and with $n$ samples, the state-of-the-art MCMC approaches for the element-wise priors achieve a per iteration complexity of $O(p^4),$ which is prohibitive when $p\gg n$. In this regime, we develop a suitably reparameterized MCMC with per iteration complexity of $O(p^3)$, providing a one-order of magnitude improvement, and consequently bringing the computational cost at par with the conjugate Wishart family, which is also $O(p^3)$ due to a use of the classical Bartlett decomposition, but this decomposition does not apply outside the Wishart family. Importantly, the proposed benefit is obtained solely due to our reparameterization in an MCMC scheme targeting the true posterior, that reverses the recently developed telescoping block decomposition of Bhadra et al. (2024), in a suitable sense. There is no variational or any other approximate Bayesian computation scheme considered in this paper that compromises targeting the true posterior. Simulations and the analysis of a breast cancer data set confirm both the correctness and better algorithmic scaling of the proposed reverse telescoping sampler.</description>

Abstract: Tensors provide a robust framework for managing high-dimensional data. Consequently, tensor analysis has emerged as an active research area in various domains, including machine learning, signal processing, computer vision, graph analysis, and data mining. This study introduces an efficient image storage approach utilizing tensors, aiming to minimize memory to store, bandwidth to transmit and energy to processing. The proposed method organizes original data into a higher-order tensor and applies the Tucker model for compression. Implemented in R, this method is compared to a baseline algorithm. The evaluation focuses on efficient of algorithm measured in term of computational time and the quality of information preserved, using both simulated and real datasets. A detailed analysis of the results is conducted, employing established quantitative metrics, with significant attention paid to sustainability in terms of energy consumption across algorithms.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of Normalizing Constant Estimation: from Jarzynski Equality to Annealed Importance Sampling and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an unnormalized probability density $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-V}$, estimating its normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\log Z$ is a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\pi$ is multimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling estimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed importance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we derive an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\mathcal{A}}^2}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$ for estimating $Z$ within $\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating $\pi$ and a tractable reference distribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport, does not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target distribution. Finally, to tackle the large action of the widely used geometric interpolation, we propose a new algorithm based on reverse diffusion samplers, establish a framework for analyzing its complexity, and empirically demonstrate its efficiency in tackling multimodality.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Inexact Computations in Multilevel Monte Carlo and Other Sampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilevel sampling methods, such as multilevel and multifidelity Monte Carlo, multilevel stochastic collocation, or delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo, have become standard uncertainty quantification (UQ) tools for a wide class of forward and inverse problems. The underlying idea is to achieve faster convergence by leveraging a hierarchy of models, such as partial differential equation (PDE) or stochastic differential equation (SDE) discretisations with increasing accuracy. By optimally redistributing work among the levels, multilevel methods can achieve significant performance improvement compared to single level methods working with one high-fidelity model. Intuitively, approximate solutions on coarser levels can tolerate large computational error without affecting the overall accuracy. We show how this can be used in high-performance computing applications to obtain a significant performance gain.
  As a use case, we analyse the computational error in the standard multilevel Monte Carlo method and formulate an adaptive algorithm which determines a minimum required computational accuracy on each level of discretisation. We show two examples of how the inexactness can be converted into actual gains using an elliptic PDE with lognormal random coefficients. Using a low precision sparse direct solver combined with iterative refinement results in a simulated gain in memory references of up to $3.5\times$ compared to the reference double precision solver; while using a MINRES iterative solver, a practical speedup of up to $1.5\times$ in terms of FLOPs is achieved. These results provide a step in the direction of energy-aware scientific computing, with significant potential for energy savings.</description>

      <title>Fast Likelihood-Free Parameter Estimation for L\'evy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: L\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability to capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency asset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when associated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast and accurate method for L\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes estimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that leverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes estimators. We contribute new theoretical results, showing that NBE results in consistent estimators whose risk converges to the Bayes estimator under mild conditions. Moreover, through extensive simulations across several L\'evy models, we show that NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while also enabling two complementary approaches to uncertainty quantification. We illustrate our approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset, where the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and interpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in complex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification over an entire year of data in just seconds. We additionally investigate nearly a decade of high-frequency Bitcoin returns, requiring less than one minute to estimate parameters under the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo on a single sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Monte Carlo simulation method (MinMC) that approximates prices and risk measures for a range $\Gamma$ of model parameters at once. The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</description>
