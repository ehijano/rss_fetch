      <title>Evolution of quantum geometric tensor of 1D periodic systems after a quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the post-quench dynamics of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of 1D periodic systems with a suddenly changed Hamiltonian. The diagonal component with respect to the crystal momentum gives a metric corresponding to the variance of the time-evolved position, and its coefficient of the quadratic term in time is the group-velocity variance, signaling ballistic wavepacket dispersion. The other diagonal QGT component with respect to time reveals the energy variance. The off-diagonal QGT component features a real part as a covariance and an imaginary part representing a quench-induced curvature. Using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, our numerical results of different quenches confirm that the post-quench QGT is governed by physical quantities and local geometric objects from the initial state and post-quench bands, such as the Berry connection, group velocities, and energy variance. Furthermore, the connections between the QGT and physical observables suggest the QGT as a comprehensive probe for nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Internal and External Field Effects upon Crystal Field Excitations in REFeO$_3$ (RE = Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, Yb$^{3+}$, Pr$^{3+}$, and Ho$^{3+}$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigated crystal-field (CF) excitations of Kramers (Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, Yb$^{3+}$) and non-Kramers (Pr$^{3+}$, Ho$^{3+}$) rare-earth ions in $REFeO_3$ using optimized CF simulations. Internal magnetic fields from the Fe$^{3+}$ and RE$^{3+}$ sublattices split the ground-state doublets of all Kramers ions (e.g. $NdFeO_3$, $ErFeO_3$, and $YbFeO_3$), generating low-energy excitations around 1 meV. In non-Kramers systems, low-energy excitations arise only when the ground state forms an accidental pseudo-doublet, as observed for Ho$^{3+}$ in $HoFeO_3$; such pseudo-doublets exhibit field-induced splitting analogous to Kramers ions. In contrast, true singlet ground states, exemplified by Pr$^{3+}$, show no zero-field splitting. Strong anisotropies are found in both internal- and external-field responses of the CF excitations in these $REFeO_3$. These results provide a unified explanation for the anomalous Zeeman splitting of CF ground states in $REFeO_3$.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological systems is the robust quantization of particle transport. It is the origin of the integer-valued quantum Hall conductivity and a potential tool for quantum information technology. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by using arrays of photonic waveguides and described by the (lattice-translational invariant) Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. In these systems, a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound multi-photon states. Upon increasing the interaction strength a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a quantum description of topological pumps of self-bound many-particle states in terms of an effective Hamiltonian of their center-of-mass (COM) motion, which allows to introduce an effective band structure $E_\mu(K)$ with $K$ being the COM momentum, and to classify topological phases in terms of generalized symmetries. We provide an explicit analytic expression of the effective Hamiltonian for few particles in the strong interaction limit and present numerical results in the more general case. We identify a topological invariant, an effective single-particle Chern number, which fully governs the soliton transport. Increasing the interaction strength in the AAH model leads to a successive merging of COM bands, which is the origin of the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential breakdown of topological quantization for some interaction strength.</description>
