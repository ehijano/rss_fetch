      <title>Stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for broad target distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resetting has been shown to reduce the completion time for a stochastic process, such as the first passage time for a diffusive searcher to find a target. The time between two consecutive resetting events is drawn from a waiting time distribution $\psi(t)$, which defines the resetting protocol. Previously, it has been shown that deterministic resetting process with a constant time period, referred to as sharp restart, can minimize the mean first passage time to a fixed target. Here we consider the more realistic problem of a target positioned at a random distance $R$ from the resetting site, selected from a given target distribution $P_T(R)$. We introduce the notion of a conjugate target distribution to a given waiting time distribution. The conjugate target distribution, $P_T^*(R)$, is that $P_T(R)$ for which $\psi(t)$ extremizes the mean time to locate the target. In the case of diffusion we derive an explicit expression for $P^*_T(R)$ conjugate to a given $\psi(t)$ which holds in arbitrary spatial dimension. Our results show that stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for target distributions with exponential or heavier tails.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of the prototypical model for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids: the restricted primitive model. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Green's function perspective on the nonlinear density response of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive equations of motion for higher order density response functions using the theory of thermodynamic Green's functions. We also derive expressions for the higher order generalized dielectric functions and polarization functions. Moreover, we relate higher order response functions and higher order collision integrals within the Martin-Schwinger hierarchy. We expect our results to be highly relevant to the study of a variety of quantum many-body systems such as matter under extreme temperatures, densities, and pressures.</description>

      <title>Boundary shape engineering for the spatial control of confined active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike an equilibrium gas, the distribution of active particles can be very sensitive to what happens at the boundaries of their container. Experiments and simulations have previously highlighted the possibility of exploiting this behavior for the geometric control of active particles, although a general theoretical framework is lacking. Here we propose a boundary method based on the flux transfer formalism typical of radiometry problems, where surface elements transmit and receive "rays" of active particles with infinite persistence length. As in the case of blackbody radiation, a Lambert scattering law results in a uniform distribution of active particles within the cavity, while other scattering laws result in specific patterns of particle accumulation in the bulk or over the boundary walls. We validate our method's predictions with numerical simulations and demonstrate its practical utility by spatially controlling swimming microalgae confined in light-defined arenas. The presented boundary method offers a simple and efficient way to predict particle distributions when both the geometry of the boundaries and the scattering law are known. In addition, it provides a general design principle for engineering container shapes optimized for transport, accumulation, and sorting of self-propelled colloids and microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-data-driven dynamical transition in quantum learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits are an essential ingredient of quantum information processing. Parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function -- quantum neural networks (QNNs) -- provide a paradigm for achieving quantum advantage in the near term. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance. In terms of supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression for large datasets, the role of quantum data in QNN training dynamics remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition, where the target value and data determine the polynomial or exponential convergence of the training. We analytically derive the complete classification of fixed points from the dynamical equation and reveal a comprehensive `phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics. These dynamics originate from a bifurcation transition with multiple codimensions induced by training data, extending the transcritical bifurcation in simple optimization tasks. Furthermore, perturbative analyses identify an exponential convergence class and a polynomial convergence class among the seven dynamics. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations of QNN training and experimental verification on IBM quantum devices. As the QNN training dynamics is determined by the choice of the target value, our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to optimize the speed of convergence.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Higgs and deconfinement-Higgs transitions in three-dimensional $Z(2)$ LGT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the three-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge theory (LGT) with $Z(2)$ gauge fields coupled to $Z(2)$-valued Higgs fields. Concretely, we explore two different order parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i) the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases. The latter operator is an analog of the overlap Edwards-Anderson order parameter for spin-glasses. According to it, the Higgs phase is realized as a glassy phase of the gauge system. For this reason standard tricks for simulations of spin-glass phases are utilized in this work, namely tempered Monte Carlo and averaging over replicas. In addition, we also present results for a certain definition of distance between Higgs field configurations. Finally, we calculate various gauge-invariant correlation functions in order to extract the corresponding masses.</description>

      <title>Large Orders and Strong-Coupling Limit in Functional Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large-order behavior of the functional renormalization group (FRG). For a model in dimension zero, we establish Borel-summability for a large class of microscopic couplings. Writing the derivatives of FRG as contour integrals, we express the Borel-transform as well as the original series as integrals. Taking the strong-coupling limit in this representation, we show that all short-ranged microscopic disorders flow to the same universal fixed point. Our results are relevant for FRG in disordered elastic systems.</description>

      <title>Competing automorphisms and disordered Floquet codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order (FET) where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study deformed Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution$\unicode{x2014}$the automorphisms "compete". We characterize the effect of this competition on Abelian-anyon FETs, showing how the evolution and loss of logical information are linked to the anyons that are invariant under the automorphisms' transition map or that localize at their boundaries. We present an example microscopic realization of this behavior using disorder in the dynamic automorphism color code. This naturally leads to a description of the space of its FETs, which we characterize by establishing when parameter-space paths connecting distinct FETs can preserve logical information. We also show that transitions between distinct FETs display criticality described by bond percolation. The perspective of competing automorphisms captures essential features of possible FETs and their transitions, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and disorder.</description>

      <title>Quenched shear stresses and shear moduli in disordered elastic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider theoretically and numerically disordered elastic networks with annealed or quenched connectivity matrices (CMs) focusing on the quenched shear stresses induced by the spontaneous symmetry breaking between different CMs. By rewriting the stress-fluctuation formalism relation for the shear modulus it is argued that theses quenched stresses give an important contribution $\mu_1$ to the finite shear modulus $\mu_q=\mu_1+\mu_a$ for quenched CMs. $\mu_a$ is a simple average over all states and CMs which for equilibrium distributions of CMs is equivalent to the shear modulus of annealed networks. Interestingly, $\mu_a$ may be strongly negative for out-of-equilibrium distributions as shown by considering a temperature quench and a scalar active two-temperature model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological organisms often have elongated, flexible structures with some degree of chirality in their bodies or movements. In nature, these organisms frequently take advantage of self-encapsulation mechanisms that create folded configurations, changing their functionality, such as for defensive purposes. Here, we explore the role of chirality in polymeric structures composed of chiral active monomers exhibiting circular motion. Through a combination of experiments and numerical simulations, we demonstrate a spontaneous unfolding-folding transition uniquely induced by chirality, a phenomenon not observed in passive polymers. This transition is driven by a self-wrapping mechanism, resulting in dynamic polymer collapse even without attractive interactions. Our findings, based on chiral polymers made from chiral active granular particles, present new opportunities in robotic applications taking advantage of the interplay between chirality and deformability.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Group Decision Making and Beyond 1. Echo Chambers and Random Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a symmetrical multiple choice individual I build a sociophysics model of decision making. Reducing the choices to two and interactions to pairs recover the Ising model from physics at zero temperature. The associated equilibrium state is a spontaneous symmetry breaking with the whole group sharing a unique choice selected at random. However, my focus departs from physics, which aims at identifying the true equilibrium state discarding any possible impact of the initial conditions, the size of the sample and the used update algorithm. Any memory of the past history is erased. In contrast, I claim that dealing with a social system, the history of the system must be taken into account in identifying the relevant social equilibrium state. Using Monte Carlo simulations I explore the spectrum of non universal equilibrium states of the Ising model at zero temperature. I show that different initial conditions with the same value of the order parameter lead to different equilibrium states. The same applies for different sizes and different update algorithms. The results indicate that in the presence of a social network composed of agents sharing different initial opinions, it is their interactions that lead them to share a unique choice and not their mere membership in the network. This finding sheds a new light on the emergence of echo chambers, which appear to be the end of a dynamical process of opinion update and not its beginning with a preferential attachment. Furthermore, polarization is obtained as a side effect of the random selection of the respective unanimous choices of the various echo chambers within a social community. The study points to social media exchange algorithms, which are purely technical levers independent of the issue and opinions at stake, to tackle polarization by either hindering or accelerating the completion of symmetry breaking between agents.</description>

      <title>NETS: A Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first examples of topological phases of matter with uniform power for measurement-based quantum computation. This is possible thanks to a new framework for analyzing the computational properties of phases of matter that is more general than previous constructions, which were limited to short-range entangled phases in one dimension. We show that ground states of the toric code in an anisotropic magnetic field yield a natural, albeit non-computationally-universal, application of our framework. We then present a new model with topological order whose ground states are universal resources for MBQC. Both topological models are enriched by subsystem symmetries, and these symmetries protect their computational power. Our framework greatly expands the range of physical models that can be analyzed from the computational perspective.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local random circuits scramble efficiently and accordingly have a range of applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. With a global $U(1)$ charge however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of $k$-fold replicated circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a $k_c$-design with $k_c = O(L^d)$ for a system in $d$ spatial dimensions with linear dimension $L$. Second, for $k &lt; k_c$, we derive bounds on the depth $\tau$ required for the circuit to converge to an approximate $k$-design. The depth is lower bounded by diffusion $k L^2 \ln(L) \lesssim \tau$. In contrast, without number conservation $\tau \sim \text{poly}(k) L$. The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks $k$ $U(1)$ symmetries. We conjecture that the associated Goldstone modes set the spectral gap for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions, leading to an upper bound $\tau \lesssim k L^{d+2}$.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonequilibrium Coexistence with Coupled Conserved and Nonconserved Order Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase separation routinely occurs in both living and synthetic systems. These phases are often complex and distinguished by features including crystallinity, nematic order, and a host of other nonconserved order parameters. For systems at equilibrium, the phase boundaries that characterize these transitions can be straightforwardly determined through the framework of thermodynamics. The prevalence of phase separation in active and driven systems motivates the need for a genuinely nonequilibrium theory for the coexistence of complex phases. Here, we develop a dynamical theory of coexistence when both conserved and nonconserved order parameters are present, casting coexistence criteria into the familiar form of equality of state functions. Our theory generalizes thermodynamic notions such as the chemical potential and Gibbs-Duhem relation to systems out of equilibrium. While these notions may not exist for all nonequilibrium systems, we numerically verify their existence for a variety of systems by introducing the phenomenological Active Model C+. We hope our work aids in the development of a comprehensive theory of high-dimensional nonequilibrium phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Hyperlogarithms in the theory of turbulence of infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric integration with hyperlogarithms so far has been successfully used in problems of high energy physics (HEP) and critical statics. In this work, for the first time, it is applied to a problem of critical dynamics, namely, a stochastic model of developed turbulence in high-dimensional spaces, which has a propagator that is non-standard with respect to the HEP: $(-i \omega + \nu k^2)^{-1}$. Adaptation of the hyperlogarithm method is carried out by choosing a proper renormalization scheme and considering an effective dimension of the space. Analytical calculation of the renormalization group functions is performed up to the fourth order of the perturbation theory, $\varepsilon$-expansion of the critical exponent $\omega$ responsible for the infrared stability of the fixed point is obtained.</description>

      <title>Mahler measures, elliptic curves and $L$-functions for the free energy of the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work establishes links between the Ising model and elliptic curves via Mahler measures. First, we reformulate the partition function of the Ising model on the square, triangular and honeycomb lattices in terms of the Mahler measure of a Laurent polynomial whose variety's projective closure defines an elliptic curve. Next, we obtain hypergeometric formulas for the partition functions on the triangular and honeycomb lattices and review the known series for the square lattice. Finally, at specific temperatures we express the free energy in terms of a Hasse-Weil $L$-function of an elliptic curve. At the critical point of the phase transition on all three lattices, we obtain the free energy more simply in terms of a Dirichlet $L$-function. These findings suggest that the connection between statistical mechanics and analytic number theory may run deeper than previously believed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Fractalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Adopting quadratic fermionic models on Sierpinski carpet, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic correction for area law in the scaling of entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, different from the fractal structure of the lattice, we observe the emergence of a novel self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Meanwhile, as the direct consequence of the entanglement fractal and beyond a single scaling behavior of entanglement contour in translation-invariant systems, we identify two distinct scaling behaviors in the entanglement contour of fractal systems. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the recent work [1,2], we formulate the first law and the second law of stochastic thermodynamics in the framework of general relativity. These laws are established for a charged Brownian particle moving in a heat reservoir and subjecting to an external electromagnetic field in generic stationary spacetime background, and in order to maintain general covariance, they are presented respectively in terms of the divergences of the energy current and the entropy density current. The stability of the equilibrium state is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Saddle avoidance of noise-induced transitions in multiscale systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10231v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multistable dynamical systems driven by weak Gaussian noise, transitions between competing states are often assumed to pass via a saddle on the separating basin boundary. By contrast, we show that timescale separation can cause saddle avoidance in non-gradient systems. Using toy models from neuroscience and ecology, we study cases where sample transitions deviate strongly from the instanton predicted by Freidlin-Wentzell theory, even for weak finite noise. We attribute this to a flat quasipotential and present an approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action to aptly predict transition paths.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in systems with diffusive dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between scrambling and projective measurements can lead to measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIPT). In this work, we show that the universality class of the MIPT is drastically altered when the system is coupled to a diffusing conserved density. Specifically, we consider a 1+1d random Clifford circuit locally monitored by classically diffusing particles (``measurers''). The resulting diffusive correlations in the measurement density are a relevant perturbation to the usual space-time random MIPT critical point, producing a new universality class for this phase transition. We find ``Griffiths-like'' effects due to rare space-time regions where, e.g., the diffusive measurers have a low or high density, but these are considerably weaker than the Griffiths effects that occur with quenched randomness that produce rare spatial regions with infinite lifetime.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose a generalization of the Liouville action which corresponds to the Nambu-Goto string like the usual Liouville action corresponds to the Polyakov string. The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible classically but revive quantumly. An equivalence with the four-derivative action suggests that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions can be described by the (4,3) minimal model analogously to the critical Ising model on a dynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual Liouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Propagation of Composite Collective Modes in Superconductor-Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions are paradigmatic systems for studying the delicate interplay of superconductivity and magnetism via proximity effects as well as their composite excitations. Here, we analyse the collective modes (CM) in such a heterostructure by taking into account the interplay between the de-magnetisation field $H_{dem}$ and the field caused by the anisotropy of the ferromagnet $H_{an}$, which was previously neglected. It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective modes, $\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of $H_{dem}&lt;H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}&gt;H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence $\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second case, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or weak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes demonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is superluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and complex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\it exception point}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske experiment, i.\,e.\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of magnetic field and voltage.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>
