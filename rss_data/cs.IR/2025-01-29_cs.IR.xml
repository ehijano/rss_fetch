      <title>360Brew: A Decoder-only Foundation Model for Personalized Ranking and Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking and recommendation systems are the foundation for numerous online experiences, ranging from search results to personalized content delivery. These systems have evolved into complex, multilayered architectures that leverage vast datasets and often incorporate thousands of predictive models. The maintenance and enhancement of these models is a labor intensive process that requires extensive feature engineering. This approach not only exacerbates technical debt but also hampers innovation in extending these systems to emerging problem domains. In this report, we present our research to address these challenges by utilizing a large foundation model with a textual interface for ranking and recommendation tasks. We illustrate several key advantages of our approach: (1) a single model can manage multiple predictive tasks involved in ranking and recommendation, (2) decoder models with textual interface due to their comprehension of reasoning capabilities, can generalize to new recommendation surfaces and out-of-domain problems, and (3) by employing natural language interfaces for task definitions and verbalizing member behaviors and their social connections, we eliminate the need for feature engineering and the maintenance of complex directed acyclic graphs of model dependencies. We introduce our research pre-production model, 360Brew V1.0, a 150B parameter, decoder-only model that has been trained and fine-tuned on LinkedIn's data and tasks. This model is capable of solving over 30 predictive tasks across various segments of the LinkedIn platform, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding those of current production systems based on offline metrics, without task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, each of these tasks is conventionally addressed by dedicated models that have been developed and maintained over multiple years by teams of a similar or larger size than our own.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Diffusion for High-Order Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems rely on Collaborative Filtering (CF) to predict user preferences by leveraging patterns in historical user-item interactions. While traditional CF methods primarily focus on learning compact vector embeddings for users and items, graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have emerged as a powerful alternative, utilizing the structure of user-item interaction graphs to enhance recommendation accuracy. However, existing GNN-based models, such as LightGCN and UltraGCN, often struggle with two major limitations: an inability to fully account for heterophilic interactions, where users engage with diverse item categories, and the over-smoothing problem in multi-layer GNNs, which hinders their ability to model complex, high-order relationships. To address these gaps, we introduce WaveHDNN, an innovative wavelet-enhanced hypergraph diffusion framework. WaveHDNN integrates a Heterophily-aware Collaborative Encoder, designed to capture user-item interactions across diverse categories, with a Multi-scale Group-wise Structure Encoder, which leverages wavelet transforms to effectively model localized graph structures. Additionally, cross-view contrastive learning is employed to maintain robust and consistent representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the efficacy of WaveHDNN, demonstrating its superior ability to capture both heterophilic and localized structural information, leading to improved recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Secure Federated Graph-Filtering for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems often rely on graph-based filters, such as normalized item-item adjacency matrices and low-pass filters. While effective, the centralized computation of these components raises concerns about privacy, security, and the ethical use of user data. This work proposes two decentralized frameworks for securely computing these critical graph components without centralizing sensitive information. The first approach leverages lightweight Multi-Party Computation and distributed singular vector computations to privately compute key graph filters. The second extends this framework by incorporating low-rank approximations, enabling a trade-off between communication efficiency and predictive performance. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve comparable accuracy to centralized state-of-the-art systems while ensuring data confidentiality and maintaining low communication costs. Our results highlight the potential for privacy-preserving decentralized architectures to bridge the gap between utility and user data protection in modern recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Document Screenshot Retrievers are Vulnerable to Pixel Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in dense retrieval have introduced vision-language model (VLM)-based retrievers, such as DSE and ColPali, which leverage document screenshots embedded as vectors to enable effective search and offer a simplified pipeline over traditional text-only methods. In this study, we propose three pixel poisoning attack methods designed to compromise VLM-based retrievers and evaluate their effectiveness under various attack settings and parameter configurations. Our empirical results demonstrate that injecting even a single adversarial screenshot into the retrieval corpus can significantly disrupt search results, poisoning the top-10 retrieved documents for 41.9% of queries in the case of DSE and 26.4% for ColPali. These vulnerability rates notably exceed those observed with equivalent attacks on text-only retrievers. Moreover, when targeting a small set of known queries, the attack success rate raises, achieving complete success in certain cases. By exposing the vulnerabilities inherent in vision-language models, this work highlights the potential risks associated with their deployment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Retrieval of Long Documents: Leveraging Fine-Grained Block Representations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional power in various domains, including information retrieval. Most of the previous practices involve leveraging these models to create a single embedding for each query, each passage, or each document individually, a strategy exemplified and used by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While this method has proven effective, we argue that it falls short in fully capturing the nuanced intricacies of document-level texts due to its reliance on a relatively coarse-grained representation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, fine-grained approach aimed at enhancing the accuracy of relevance scoring for long documents. Our methodology firstly segments a long document into blocks, each of which is embedded using an LLM, for matching with the query representation. When calculating the relevance score, we aggregate the query-block relevance scores through a weighted sum method, yielding a comprehensive score for the query with the entire document. Despite its apparent simplicity, our experimental findings reveal that this approach outperforms standard representation methods and achieves a significant reduction in embedding generation latency. Moreover, by carefully optimizing pairwise loss functions, superior performances have been achieved.</description>

      <title>URAG: Implementing a Unified Hybrid RAG for Precise Answers in University Admission Chatbots -- A Case Study at HCMUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in educational question-answering systems, especially university admission chatbots. Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.</description>

      <title>RAPID: Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Inference Drafting for Text-Based Video Event Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving events from videos using text queries has become increasingly challenging due to the rapid growth of multimedia content. Existing methods for text-based video event retrieval often focus heavily on object-level descriptions, overlooking the crucial role of contextual information. This limitation is especially apparent when queries lack sufficient context, such as missing location details or ambiguous background elements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel system called RAPID (Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Inference Drafting), which leverages advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt-based learning to semantically correct and enrich user queries with relevant contextual information. These enriched queries are then processed through parallel retrieval, followed by an evaluation step to select the most relevant results based on their alignment with the original query. Through extensive experiments on our custom-developed dataset, we demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods, particularly for contextually incomplete queries. Our system was validated for both speed and accuracy through participation in the Ho Chi Minh City AI Challenge 2024, where it successfully retrieved events from over 300 hours of video. Further evaluation comparing RAPID with the baseline proposed by the competition organizers demonstrated its superior effectiveness, highlighting the strength and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>On Storage Neural Network Augmented Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) has been gaining attention along with the latest machine learning researches employing ANNs. If the data is too large to fit in memory, it is necessary to search for the most similar vectors to a given query vector from the data stored in storage devices, not from that in memory. The storage device such as NAND flash memory has larger capacity than the memory device such as DRAM, but they also have larger latency to read data. Therefore, ANN methods for storage require completely different approaches from conventional in-memory ANN methods. Since the approximation that the time required for search is determined only by the amount of data fetched from storage holds under reasonable assumptions, our goal is to minimize it while maximizing recall. For partitioning-based ANNs, vectors are partitioned into clusters in the index building phase. In the search phase, some of the clusters are chosen, the vectors in the chosen clusters are fetched from storage, and the nearest vector is retrieved from the fetched vectors. Thus, the key point is to accurately select the clusters containing the ground truth nearest neighbor vectors. We accomplish this by proposing a method to predict the correct clusters by means of a neural network that is gradually refined by alternating supervised learning and duplicated cluster assignment. Compared to state-of-the-art SPANN and an exhaustive method using k-means clustering and linear search, the proposed method achieves 90% recall on SIFT1M with 80% and 58% less data fetched from storage, respectively.</description>

      <title>VeriFact: Verifying Facts in LLM-Generated Clinical Text with Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods to ensure factual accuracy of text generated by large language models (LLM) in clinical medicine are lacking. VeriFact is an artificial intelligence system that combines retrieval-augmented generation and LLM-as-a-Judge to verify whether LLM-generated text is factually supported by a patient's medical history based on their electronic health record (EHR). To evaluate this system, we introduce VeriFact-BHC, a new dataset that decomposes Brief Hospital Course narratives from discharge summaries into a set of simple statements with clinician annotations for whether each statement is supported by the patient's EHR clinical notes. Whereas highest agreement between clinicians was 88.5%, VeriFact achieves up to 92.7% agreement when compared to a denoised and adjudicated average human clinican ground truth, suggesting that VeriFact exceeds the average clinician's ability to fact-check text against a patient's medical record. VeriFact may accelerate the development of LLM-based EHR applications by removing current evaluation bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Generating Negative Samples for Multi-Modal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal recommender systems (MMRS) have gained significant attention due to their ability to leverage information from various modalities to enhance recommendation quality. However, existing negative sampling techniques often struggle to effectively utilize the multi-modal data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in negative sampling for MMRS: (1) producing cohesive negative samples contrasting with positive samples and (2) maintaining a balanced influence across different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose NegGen, a novel framework that utilizes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate balanced and contrastive negative samples. We design three different prompt templates to enable NegGen to analyze and manipulate item attributes across multiple modalities, and then generate negative samples that introduce better supervision signals and ensure modality balance. Furthermore, NegGen employs a causal learning module to disentangle the effect of intervened key features and irrelevant item attributes, enabling fine-grained learning of user preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NegGen compared to state-of-the-art methods in both negative sampling and multi-modal recommendation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Passage Embeddings for Efficient Listwise Reranking with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using large language language models (LLMs) in passage ranking. The listwise approaches, such as RankGPT, have become new state-of-the-art in this task. However, the efficiency of RankGPT models is limited by the maximum context length and relatively high latency of LLM inference. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose PE-Rank, leveraging the single passage embedding as a good context compression for efficient listwise passage reranking. By treating each passage as a special token, we can directly input passage embeddings into LLMs, thereby reducing input length. Additionally, we introduce an inference method that dynamically constrains the decoding space to these special tokens, accelerating the decoding process. For adapting the model to reranking, we employ listwise learning to rank loss for training. Evaluation results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PE-Rank significantly improves efficiency in both prefilling and decoding, while maintaining competitive ranking effectiveness.  The Code is available at https://github.com/liuqi6777/pe_rank.</description>

      <title>Foundational Large Language Models for Materials Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</description>
