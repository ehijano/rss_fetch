      <title>Spherical inspirals of spinning bodies into Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a stellar-mass compact object spiraling into a massive black hole, are key sources for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Accurate modeling of these systems requires incorporating the spin effects of both the primary and secondary bodies, particularly for waveforms at the precision required for LISA detection and astrophysical parameter extraction. In this work, we develop a framework for modeling flux-driven spherical inspirals (orbits of approximately constant Boyer-Lindquist radius) of a spinning secondary into a Kerr black hole. We leverage recently found solutions for the motion of spinning test particles and compute the associated gravitational wave fluxes to linear order in the secondary spin. Next, we show that spherical orbits remain spherical under radiation reaction at linear order in spin, and derive the evolution of the orbital parameters throughout the inspiral. We implement a numerical scheme for waveform generation in the frequency domain and assess the impact of the secondary spin on the gravitational wave signal. In contrast to quasi-circular inspirals, we find that neglecting the secondary spin in spherical inspirals induces large mismatches in the waveforms that will plausibly be detectable by LISA.</description>

      <title>The Persistence of Nonlinear Gravitational Wave Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear gravitational wave memory is a surprise of theoretical physics. Whereas it is understood that a gravitational wave induces oscillatory squeezing and stretching motion in a collection of freely-falling test masses, it is unexpected that the wave leaves a residual displacement of the test masses. This displacement is the tribute in memoriam to the passing wave. The memory originates in a nonlinear feature of gravitation. Whilst merging black holes are a significant source of gravitational waves, the gravitational wave energy itself is a further source of gravitational waves. The memory is often described as a permanent displacement of the test masses caused by a burst of primary gravitational waves. But as we show, memory vanishes at late times in a sea of echoes.</description>

      <title>Close Hyperbolic Encounters In f(R) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission from black hole pairs on unbound orbits undergoing close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs) in dense astrophysical environments. While General Relativity predicts gravitational Bremsstrahlung radiation occurring at periastron, the contribution of the scalar gravitational-wave mode in fully general f(R) gravity remains largely unexplored. We characterize the f(R) scalar mode gravitational radiation for both non-precessing and precessing hyperbolic orbits, identifying potential detection signatures for advanced gravitational wave observatories. By systematically varying orbital precession and eccentricity, we examine their influence on the emitted gravitational waves. We derive potentially detectable time delay and scalar-to-tensor amplitude ratio estimates for representative astrophysical environments and determine optimal orbital configurations for the detection of f(R) scalar gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters. Our results provide a theoretical framework for scalar-mode signals and observables, establishing CHEs as a promising probe of f(R) gravity with future detectors.</description>

      <title>Excising Cauchy Horizons with Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged and/or rotating black holes in General Relativity feature Cauchy horizons, which indicate a breakdown of predictability in the theory. Focusing on spherically symmetric charged black holes, we remark that the inevitability of Reissner-Nordstrom Cauchy horizon is due to the divergent electromagnetic self-energy of point charges. We demonstrate that any causal theory of nonlinear electrodynamics that regularizes the point charge self-energy also eliminates Cauchy horizons for weakly charged black holes. These black holes feature one (event) horizon and a spacelike singularity, analogous to the Schwarzschild metric. An example with Born-Infeld electrodynamics illustrates how this gives rise to an upper bound on the charge, which we compare with known bounds.</description>

      <title>Exact vacuum solution with Hopf structure in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact solution to the vacuum Einstein equations is presented, whose structure is based on the Hopf fibration. The solution employs a geodesic null vector field that defines a twisting congruence and appears in the metric in Kerr-Schild form. This solution is of Petrov type D and involves two parameters. Remarkably, the resulting spacetime is regular, with no curvature singularities. Both the Kretschmann scalar and the Chern-Pontryagin scalar are nonzero and remain finite throughout the spacetime. In addition, the Newman-Penrose Weyl scalar $\Psi_2$ possesses both nonzero real and imaginary parts, reflecting the topologically nontrivial nature of the gravitational field. The spacetime also admits two Killing vector fields and a Killing-Yano tensor, which induces an associated Killing tensor, revealing its hidden symmetry. The derivation is simple and self-contained, offering a transparent and geometrically guided approach to finding new exact solutions in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach to criticality of AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a hidden symmetry between the specific volumes of the coexistent phases and hence develop an analytical approach to study criticality of AdS black holes. In particular, using the method, we solve the coexistence line exactly for a variety of black holes, including the charged AdS black hole (in the four and the five dimensions), the rotating AdS black hole, the Gauss-Bonnet black hole and the quantum BTZ black hole.</description>

      <title>Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realised in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint, considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behaviour and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realise an oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study quantitatively two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models, which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behaviour and oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by numerically solving the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity, which can naturally realise a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realise the phantom evolution.</description>

      <title>Identification of Noise-Associated Glitches in KAGRA O3GK with Hveto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient noise ("glitches") in gravitational wave detectors can mimic or obscure true signals, significantly reducing detection sensitivity. Identifying and excluding glitch-contaminated data segments is therefore crucial for enhancing the performance of gravitational-wave searches. We perform a noise analysis of the KAGRA data obtained during the O3GK observation. Our analysis is performed with hierarchical veto (Hveto) which identifies noises based on the statistical time correlation between the main channel and the auxiliary channels. A total of 2,531 noises were vetoed by 28 auxiliary channels with the configuration (i.e., signal-to-noise threshold set to 8) that we chose for Hveto. We identify vetoed events as glitches on the spectrogram via visual examination after plotting them with Q-transformation. By referring to the Gravity Spy project, we categorize 2,354 glitches into six types: blip, helix, scratchy, and scattered light, which correspond to those listed in Gravity Spy, and dot and line, which are not found in the Gravity Spy classification and are thus named based on their spectrogram morphology in KAGRA data. The remaining 177 glitches are determined not to belong to any of these six types. We show how the KAGRA glitch types are related to each subsystem of KAGRA. To investigate the possible correlation between the main channel and the round winner - an auxiliary channel statistically associated with the main channel for vetoing purposes - we visually examine the similarity or difference in the glitch pattern on the spectrogram. We compare the qualitative correlation found through visual examination with coherence, which is known to provide quantitative measurement for the correlation between the main channel and each auxiliary channel. Our comprehensive noise analysis will help improve the data quality of KAGRA by applying it to future KAGRA observation data.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principles and Non-local Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Extended Uncertainty Principle in the context of black hole solutions coming from non-local theories of gravity, focusing, specifically, on Infinite Derivative Gravity. We argue that these modifications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are effective descriptions arising from the non-local features of gravitational interaction. By comparing the predictions of both the modified uncertainty principles and non-local gravity, we find theoretical constraints on otherwise free parameters as well as universal laws for black hole physics beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dark Energy via Non-Minimal Coupling in $f(Q,L_m)$ Gravity with Gong-Zhang Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of non-minimally coupled $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $L_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. We derive modified Friedmann equations in a flat FLRW background and employ the \textit{Gong-Zhang} parameterization for the DE equation of state (EoS), allowing an analytical form of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernova datasets through MCMC-based chi-squared minimization. We analyze various cosmological quantities including the deceleration parameter, EoS, jerk, snap, lerk, and diagnostic tools such as $Om(z)$ and the statefinder pair $(r,s)$. Our findings indicate a viable transition from deceleration to acceleration and reveal a quintessence-to-phantom-like evolution of dark energy. Furthermore, energy conditions are examined, showing a violation of the strong energy condition, consistent with current cosmic acceleration. The results establish that the $f(Q,L_m) $ framework with non-minimal coupling and parameterized EoS provides a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation and behaviour of bound states formed outside the horizon of a black hole in the presence of quintessence matter. Calculating the Regge and Wheeler potential for general metric function, we find that the presence of quintessence influences significantly the metric function and the Hawking temperature. We show that large black holes radiate less in the presence of large quintessence matter and it seems to live longer, while small black holes radiate more.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe are presented.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of accretion disk geometry in shaping black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.</description>

      <title>Systematic bias in LISA ringdown analysis due to waveform inaccuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inaccurate modeling of gravitational-wave signals can introduce systematic biases in the inferred source parameters. As detector sensitivities improve and signals become louder, mitigating such waveform-induced systematics becomes increasingly important. In this work, we assess the systematic biases introduced by an incomplete description of the ringdown signal from massive black hole binaries in the LISA band. Specifically, we investigate the impact of mode truncation in the ringdown template. Using a reference waveform composed of 13 modes, we establish a mode hierarchy and determine the minimum number of modes required to avoid parameter biases across a wide range of LISA sources. For typical systems with masses $\sim 10^6$--$10^7\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \sim 2$--$6$, we find that at least 3--6 modes are needed for accurate parameter estimation, while high-SNR events may need at least 10 modes. Our results are a window-insensitive lower bound on the minimum number of modes, as more modes may be needed depending on the choice of time-domain windowing of the post-merger signal.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of Kerr black holes in the full subextremal range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove, unconditionally, the linear stability of the Kerr family in the full subextremal range. On an analytic level, our proof is the same as that of our earlier paper in the slowly rotating case. The additional ingredients we use are, firstly, the mode stability result proved by Andersson, Whiting, and the first author and, secondly, computations related to the zero energy behavior of the linearized gauge-fixed Einstein equation in work by the second author.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Generation and Detection in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production and detection of gravitational waves (GWs) within the framework of Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT). In this theory, GWs exhibit five propagating modes: one scalar, two vector, and two tensor modes. Unlike General Relativity, the gravitational field equations in GQFT involve both symmetric and antisymmetric tensors, governed by their respective energy-momentum tensors, both of which can act as sources for GW radiation. By solving the linearized gravitational equations, we derive general analytic expressions for the different GW degrees of freedom. Our analysis reveals that the symmetric energy-momentum tensor generates scalar and tensor GWs through the trace and traceless parts of the quadrupole moment, respectively. In contrast, the antisymmetric stress tensor induces scalar and vector GWs with enhanced coupling strengths. We examine two illustrative examples: a black hole binary with a slightly elliptical orbit, which produces scalar GWs, and a neutron star binary where one component has a net spin aligned with its velocity, leading to vector GW emission. Finally, we study the detectability of these GW polarizations by analyzing their signatures in GW detectors. Our findings indicate that current observatories can detect both scalar and tensor modes, while a newly designed detector would be required to probe vector GWs.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of quantum field theory in the presence of a wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, quantum theory of a real massive scalar field in the background of a traversable wormhole is examined. The wormhole is supposed to connect two different universes, as a particular example the simplest Ellis wormhole is considered. It is shown that the resulting theory possesses a doubling of quantum states parameterized by the same value of asymptotic momentum, two different sets of such degenerate states are localized in different universes. This is a consequence of the topological structure of the wormhole spacetime, which is the same as the topological structure of the Schwarzschild spacetime providing a similar degeneracy of quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of black holes, taking into account the non-extensivity of their entropy at the thermodynamic and statistical level. To this end, we interpret the R\'enyi entropy as determining the fundamental thermodynamic equation, which is represented by a quasi-homogeneous function. As a consequence, the R\'enyi parameter turns out to be an independent thermodynamic variable that must be treated in the framework of extended thermodynamics. As a particular example, we use the formalism of geometrothermodynamics to show that the Schwarzschild black hole can become stable for certain values of the R\'enyi parameter.</description>

      <title>Towards Stochastic Inflation in Higher-Curvature Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic inflation in the presence of higher-curvature terms non-minimally coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on quadratic curvature invariants, we single out the Gauss--Bonnet term which is known to avoid ghosts, while having non-trivial effects on the background and scalar mode evolution when coupled to the scalar field. Stochastic Klein--Gordon and Langevin equations are derived in the presence of the Gauss--Bonnet coupling, and their slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll limits are studied. By using first-passage time method, scalar power spectrum is computed in these limits. Stochastic evolution of a Gauss--Bonnet-coupled spectator field in de Sitter vacuum is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model in which black hole scalarization occurs for supermassive black holes, while their less massive counterparts remain unscalarized, has been recently proposed. We explore whether this model can emerge from an effective field theory obtained by integrating out a heavy second scalar field. We show that the resulting EFT does not have the right coupling sign or the right hierarchy of scales. We then consider whether supermassive black hole scalarization could occur in theories with two scalars. We show that, although they can violate black hole uniqueness through curvature- and spin-induced scalarization, they do not naturally produce scalarization exclusively for supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Eisenhart-Duval lift, Nonlocal Conservation laws and Painlev\'{e} Analysis in Scalar field Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of nonlocal conservation laws for the gravitational field equations of scalar field cosmology in an FLRW background with a dust fluid source. We perform such analysis by using a novel approach for the Eisenhart-Duval lift. It follows that the scalar field potential $V\left( \phi \right) =\alpha \left( e^{\lambda \phi }+\beta \right) $ admits nontrivial conservation laws. Furthermore, we employ the Painlev\'{e} analysis to examine the integrability of the field equations. For the quintessence model, we establish that the cosmological field equations possess the Painlev\'{e} property and are integrable for $\lambda ^{2}&gt;6$. In contrast, for the phantom scalar field, the cosmological field equations exhibit the Painlev\'{e} property for any value of the parameter $% \lambda $. We present analytic solutions expressed in terms of Right Laurent expansions for various values of the parameter $\lambda $. Finally, we discuss the qualitative evolution of the effective equation of state parameter for these analytic solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a symplectic structure for the phase space of a generic Lagrangian field theory expressed in the framework of $L_\infty$ algebras. The symplectic structure does not require explicit knowledge of the derivative content of the Lagrangian, and therefore is applicable to nonlocal models, such as string field theory, where traditional constructions are difficult to apply. We test our proposal in a number of examples ranging from general relativity to $p$-adic string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.</description>

      <title>Nowhere left to hide: revealing realistic gravitational-wave populations in high dimensions and high resolution with PixelPop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origins of merging compact binaries observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors remain uncertain, with multiple astrophysical channels possibly contributing to the merger rate. Formation processes can imprint nontrivial correlations in the underlying distribution of source properties, but current understanding of the overall population relies heavily on simplified and uncorrelated parametric models. In this work, we use PixelPop-a high-resolution Bayesian nonparametric model with minimal assumptions-to analyze multidimensional correlations in the astrophysical distribution of masses, spins, and redshifts of black-hole mergers from mock gravitational-wave catalogs constructed using population-synthesis simulations. With full parameter estimation on 400 detections at current sensitivities, we show explicitly that neglecting population-level correlations biases inference. In contrast, modeling all significant correlations with PixelPop allows us to correctly measure the astrophysical merger rate across all source parameters. We then propose a nonparametric method to distinguish between different formation channels by comparing the PixelPop results back to astrophysical simulations. For our simulated catalog, we find that only formation channels with significantly different physical processes are distinguishable, whereas channels that share evolutionary stages are not. Given the substantial uncertainties in source formation, our results highlight the necessity of multidimensional astrophysics-agnostic models like PixelPop for robust interpretation of gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first computation of the nonlinear gravitational memory waveform for the scattering of two compact objects in General Relativity at leading order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We use the scattering-amplitudes-based representation of the gravitational waveform, which naturally expresses the nonlinear memory as the contribution of soft gravitons emitted by the gravitational waves themselves. We perform the calculation by applying a multipolar decomposition to the waveform and using the reverse unitarity method to obtain explicit exact-in-velocity predictions. We validate the results by calculating the corresponding velocity-expanded post-Newtonian multipoles, finding perfect agreement. Our results complete the knowledge of the gauge-invariant non-analytic-in-frequency part of the $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$ multipolar waveform, thus providing a useful benchmark for future calculations of this quantity.</description>

      <title>The fate of Quasi-Exponential inflation in the light of ACT-DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have revisited quasi-exponential model of inflation in the light of recent ACT-DR6 and Planck-2018 data along with latest constraint on the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. For our analysis we have followed Mukhanov approach for inflationary equation-of-state employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that the model is capable of mimicking Planck-2018 results by providing excellent fit to scalar spectral index and its running. Not only that, amount of primordial gravity waves is also in tune with the present observational bound, $r&lt;0.032$. But, when constraints on scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are considered simultaneously quasi-exponential inflation fails to live up to the Planck-2018 result. However when the combination of ACT-DR6 and Planck-2018 data is taken into account inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model are in excellent agreement. The model also yields sublime fit to the result of joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data. Further the constraint on primordial gravity waves from the futuristic CMB missions in the likes of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 when combined with ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data renders a first-class match with the inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model of inflation. However, non-detection of primordial gravity waves by LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 will potentially rule out quasi-exponential model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key issues in holography is going beyond $\mathrm{AdS}$ and defining quantum gravity in spacetimes with a null boundary. Recent examples of this type involve linear dilaton asymptotics and are related to the $T \overline{T}$ deformation. We present a holographic correspondence derived from string theory, which is an example of a kind of celestial holography. The holographic definition is a spacetime non-commutative open string theory supported on D1-D5 branes together with fundamental strings. The gravity solutions interpolate between $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ metrics and six-dimensional metrics. Radiation can escape to null infinity, which makes both the encoding of quantum information in the boundary and the dynamics of black holes quite different from $\mathrm{AdS}$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \approx 2.62 M_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.</description>

      <title>Higgs pole inflation with loop corrections in light of ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Coleman-Weinberg potential for the inflaton in the pole inflation scenarios such as the Higgs pole inflation and the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) pole inflation. The loop corrections stem from the Standard Model particles and extra singlet scalar fields in the former case, making the quartic coupling for the Higgs inflaton modified by the inflaton-dependent power corrections during inflation. We also obtain similar power corrections to the quartic coupling for the PQ inflaton, depending on the realizations of the PQ symmetry in KSVZ and DFSZ models. We show that the loop corrections shift the spectral index in the pole inflation to a larger value in favor of the ACT results, while being compatible with the bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. For a positive one-loop beta function for the inflaton quartic coupling (namely, $b_1&gt;0$), a sub-dominant contribution from the two-loop corrections can be accommodated. On the other hand, if the one-loop beta function for the inflaton coupling is negative (namely, $b_1&lt;0$), we need sizable contributions from two-loops that are larger than the one-loop corrections due to the ACT results.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Momentum-coupled Dark Energy using DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.</description>

      <title>Gravity Duality of Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network has been attracting increasing attention for its role in driving the artificial intelligence revolution and enabling profound insights into gravity. This paper investigates the gravity dual of the conformal field theory defined on a network (AdS/NCFT). A typical network, consisting of edges and nodes, is dual to a spacetime with branches and connecting branes, which we refer to as Net-branes. We demonstrate that the junction condition on the Net-brane results in energy conservation at the network node, providing strong support for our proposal of AdS/NCFT.
  We find that the spectrum of gravitational Kaluza-Klein modes on the Net-brane is a combination of the spectra from the AdS/BCFT with Neumann boundary conditions and Dirichlet/Conformal boundary conditions, corresponding to the isolated and transparent modes, respectively. We study two-point functions for NCFTs and provide examples, such as free fields and AdS/NCFT with tensionless Net-branes. We propose that the RT surfaces intersect at the same point on the Net-brane for connected subsystems within the network and verify this with the strong additivity and monotonicity of entanglement entropy. We establish that the network entropy, defined as the difference in entanglement between NCFT and BCFT, is always non-negative and effectively illustrates the network's complexity. Finally, we briefly discuss the holographic perspective of the shortest path problem and reveal its relation to the shortest geodesic in bulk and the holographic two-point correlators of massive operators.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted Supercooling: From PTA to LIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Quasar cosmology II: joint analyses with Cosmic Microwave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.</description>

      <title>Observers and Timekeepers: From the Page-Wootters Mechanism to the Gravitational Path Integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity in a closed universe faces two a priori distinct yet seemingly related issues: the problem of time and the fact that its Hilbert space dimension is one. Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating physics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral model, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative effects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over topologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest frameworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how it applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular, we emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a subsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert space, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be used as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a nontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating observers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that implementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent generalization of holography.</description>

      <title>Detectability and Parameter Estimation for Einstein Telescope Configurations with GWJulia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect tens of thousands of compact binary coalescences (CBC) per year, depending also on the final detectors layout. For this reason, it is essential to have a fast, reliable tool for forecasting how different detector layouts will affect parameter estimation for these events. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a common tool for tackling this problem. In this paper, we present a new open source code GWJulia to perform FIM analysis of CBC parameters, i.e., stellar black-hole binaries (BBH), neutron star binaries (BNS), and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). The code is purely written in Julia, making it fast while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We consider a set of case studies to compare different Einstein Telescope (ET) designs. We compare a 10km triangular configuration with two 15km L-shaped detectors with different orientations and temperatures. We discuss also the accuracy of combinations of parameters, which is very informative for cosmology or population studies. Finally, we focus on the detection of golden events and explore how the FIM can guide posterior sampling of GW signals using a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.

      <description>arXiv:2412.04283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent developments in structural stability as applied to key topics in general relativity. For a nonlinear dynamical system arising from the Einstein equations by a symmetry reduction, bifurcation theory fully characterizes the set of all stable perturbations of the system, known as the `versal unfolding'. This construction yields a comprehensive classification of qualitatively distinct solutions and their metamorphoses into new topological forms, parametrized by the codimension of the bifurcation in each case. We illustrate these ideas through bifurcations in the simplest Friedmann models, the Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole, the evolution of causal geodesic congruences in cosmology and black-hole spacetimes, crease flow on event horizons, and the Friedmann-Lema\^itre equations. Finally, we list open problems and briefly discuss emerging aspects such as partial differential equation stability of versal families, the general relativity landscape, and potential connections between gravitational versal unfoldings and those of the Maxwell, Dirac, and Schr\"{o}dinger equations.</description>

      <title>The effective phase space and $e$-folding of the Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky model of inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For zero spatial curvature, cosmological phase space of Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky inflationary model show three apparent attractors; the fixed angle attractor in the large field limit, the final attractor representing reheating phase in the small field region, and the apparent attractor corresponding to the slow-roll condition connecting between the large-field and small-field region. To consider the total $e$-folding likelihood of the model, Remmen-Carroll conserved measure is constructed and normalized. Using the measure, the total e-folding number $N$ and its expectation value $\left\langle N \right\rangle$ are calculated. Our results show that most classical slow-roll trajectories which intersect the Planck surface have $N&lt;60$, and $\phi_{\rm UV}&gt;5.5 M^{*}_{\rm Pl}$ is required for $N&gt;60$. It is found that for $\phi_{\rm UV}\in [5.22,5.50]M^{*}_{\rm Pl}$ which satisfies the constraint on the spectral index, $n_s = 0.9658 \pm 0.0040\,\,\,(68\%\,\,{\rm CL})$, the expectation value $\langle N \rangle \simeq 3.5 - 4$ for trajectories intersecting the Planck surface in the Starobinsky model. For extended Starobinsky model with additional $R^3$ term parametrized by a coupling parameter $\alpha$, the expectation value when inflation starts from the top of the potential shifts to $\left\langle N \right\rangle = 4.025,4.336$ for $\alpha = 10^{-4},6.5\times 10^{-5}$ respectively. In the Starobinsky model even at very large inflaton cutoff $\phi_{\rm UV}$ where the field value is super-Planckian, the energy density from the (saturating) inflaton potential and the Hubble parameter are still sub-Planckian and therefore the inflation occurs within the semi-classical regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in near-extremal charged black hole spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the semiclassical current and stress-energy fluxes both at the event and Cauchy horizon of a near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We consider a minimally-coupled, massless, charged scalar field in the Unruh state, describing an evaporating black hole. The near-extremal domain allows for an analytical treatment of the scattering problem of the Boulware modes both in the interior and exterior regions. We present this and explicit analytical expressions for $\langle j_v\rangle $, $\langle T_{vv}\rangle$ at the horizons, as well as estimates for $\langle j_u\rangle$ and $\langle T_{uu}\rangle $. We cross-check the analytical results numerically by bringing the radial Klein-Gordon equation into the form of the confluent Heun equation. Inserting these expectation values as sources to the Einstein-Maxwell equations, we find that at least in the near-extremal regime of small field charge, quantum effects drive the black hole interior away from extremality. Our work generalizes the known results for the real scalar field [Phys. Rev. D 104, 024066] and is in agreement with recent work on charged fields in expanding Reissner-Nordstr\"om deSitter universes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 231301, Phys. Rev. D 104, 025009].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the Finslerian interpretation of null geodesics in the exterior regions of stationary black holes, particularly through the Zermelo navigation problem and the Randers metric. In this work, we show that recent mathematical advancements in wind-Finslerian structures, which involve the critical and strong Zermelo navigation problems and their connections to Kropina and Lorentz-Finsler metrics, enable the extension of the Finslerian framework to encompass horizons and their interior regions of black holes. The Finslerian indicatrix, a key element of this framework, serves as an effective tool for identifying frame-dragging effects and the location of horizons and ergosurfaces. We illustrate our results with explicit physical examples, focusing on spherically symmetric black holes, Kerr black holes, and analog models of gravity. Our findings provide new insights into the ``river model'' of black holes, offering enhanced visual representations of null geodesics on the ergosurfaces, horizons, and within their interior regions.</description>

Abstract: In this review we look into the gauge-dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are second-order tensors produced by first-order scalar-modes. The method includes deriving the background, first- and second-order Einstein field equations without imposing a gauge. We address the gauge-invariant approach and study the source-term of SIGWs in three different gauges, synchronous, Poisson and uniform curvature gauge. We find that numerically computed kernels in all three gauges behave closely with minimal discrepancy. As expected, when going in sub-horizon modes, $k\tau\gg1$, the discrepancy decreases and the behavior matches, pointing to a gauge-invariant observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black hole systems are typically assumed to evolve in vacuum. However, the environment surrounding the binary components can influence their properties, such as their tidal deformability, affecting the gravitational waveform produced by the binary and its interpretation in gravitational wave data analysis. In this work we focus on next-generation experiments, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, and we quantify the systematic biases in gravitational wave observations that arise when tidally deformed binaries are interpreted as occurring in vacuum. We consider binaries over a range of masses and we compare different phenomenological models for the dynamical evolution of the tidal deformability. We find that systematic biases could significantly affect the measurability of the binary parameters if tidal effects are not carefully modeled.</description>

      <title>Multimodal signatures of asymptotic (A)dS Kalb-Ramond black holes: Constraints through the shadow, weak deflection angle, and topological photon spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores novel static, neutral black hole solutions within Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity in asymptotically (anti-)de Sitter [(A)dS] spacetimes, incorporating spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via an antisymmetric tensor field. Focusing on two metric configurations, we derive general analytical expressions for the horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow radius, and weak gravitational deflection angle. The universality of these expressions enables their applicability to a broad class of non-rotating spacetimes beyond KR gravity. By confronting these models with empirical data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and Solar System experiments, the work yields tight constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$, demonstrating that certain parameterizations - particularly Case B - yield observationally viable and physically consistent outcomes. Additionally, we employ topological methods to analyze black hole thermodynamics and photon sphere stability, uncovering critical geometrical structures in both thermodynamic and optical contexts. These multimodal signatures collectively offer a powerful framework for testing Lorentz-violating extensions of General Relativity (GR) and highlight the potential of topological diagnostics in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on the irregular singular point of the wave equation for a massive scalar field in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a massive scalar field in a fixed Schwarzschild background, the radial wave equation obeyed by Fourier modes is first studied. After reducing such a radial wave equation to its normal form, we first study approximate solutions in the neighborhood of the origin, horizon and point at infinity, and then we relate the radial with the Heun equation, obtaining local solutions at the regular singular points. Moreover, we obtain the full asymptotic expansion of the local solution in the neighborhood of the irregular singular point at infinity. We also obtain and study the associated integral representation of the massive scalar field. Eventually, the technique developed for the irregular singular point is applied to the homogeneous equation associated with the inhomogeneous Zerilli equation for gravitational perturbations in a Schwarzschild background.</description>

      <title>Bound States of the Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the physical significance and spectral stability of black hole quasinormal modes is fundamental to high-precision spectroscopy with future gravitational wave detectors. Inspired by Mashhoon's idea of relating quasinormal modes of black holes with their equivalent bound states in an inverted potential, we investigate, for the first time, energy levels and eigenfunctions of the Schwarzschild black hole quantitatively. While quasinormal modes describe the characteristic damped oscillations of a black hole, the bound states of the inverted potential are qualitatively more similar to those of the hydrogen atom. Although the physical interpretation of these states may initially be of more academic interest, it furthers our understanding of open problems related to quasinormal modes in a similar spirit to Maggiore's interpretation of the Schwarzschild quasinormal mode spectrum. One surprising insight from the explicit calculation of bound states is that eigenfunctions corresponding to quasinormal mode overtones become rapidly delocalized and extremely loosely bound. This observation raises immediate questions about the common interpretation of quasinormal modes as excitations of the lightring region. Closely related, as a second application, we also explore the spectral stability of bound states and demonstrate that they can provide complementary insights into the quasinormal mode spectrum.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from b-EMRIs: Doppler shift and beaming, resonant excitation, helicity oscillations and self-lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from a stellar-mass binary orbiting a spinning supermassive black hole, a system referred to as a binary extreme mass ratio inspiral (b-EMRI). We use Dixon's formalism to describe the stellar-mass binary as a particle with internal structure, and keep terms up to quadrupole order to capture the generation of gravitational waves by the inner motion of the stellar-mass binary. The problem of emission and propagation of waves is treated from first principles using black hole perturbation theory. In the gravitational waveform at future null infinity, we identify for the first time Doppler shifts and beaming due to the motion of the center of mass, as well as helicity breaking gravitational lensing, and resonances with ringdown modes of the supermassive black hole. We establish that previously proposed phenomenological models inadequately capture these effects.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Spike surrounding Supermassive Black Holes Binary and the Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA, CPTA and MPTA collaborations have reported compelling evidence for the existence of the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). This inferred background's amplitude and frequency spectrum align closely with the astrophysical predictions for a signal originating from the population of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Considering these findings, we explore the possibility of detecting dark matter (DM) spikes surrounding SMBHs, which could alter the gravitational-wave waveform and influence the SGWB. We show that the evolution of SMBH binaries, driven by both gravitational radiation and the dynamic friction of the surrounding DM spike, presents observable effects in the nHz frequency domain of the SGWB. We also employ the Bayesian inference method to fit the SGWB spectra from the NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA. The model with DM spike improves the fittings to the former two data sets. The spike slope $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ is slightly smaller than 1, which may suggest that the spike is flattened during the inspiral of the SMBHBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical quantization of free bosonic closed string theory and observe that the physicality of states requires vanishing of the worldsheet Virasoro algebra generators sandwiched between any two physical states. This requirement yields four classes of physical states, depending on discrete worldsheet symmetries: parity and time reversal. The usual string states which are highest weight states of the Virasoro algebra, preserve both, while the other new three classes break one or both. We apply our formulation to an accelerated worldsheet with horizons, initiating the worldsheet formulation of a thermal string theory and strings probing horizon of black holes.</description>

      <title>Binary Kerr black-hole scattering at 2PM from quantum higher-spin Compton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum higher-spin theory applied to Compton amplitudes has proven to be surprisingly useful for elucidating Kerr black hole dynamics. Here we apply the framework to compute scattering amplitudes and observables for a binary system of two rotating black holes, at second post-Minkowskian order, and to all orders in the spin-multipole expansion for certain quantities. Starting from the established three-point and conjectured Compton quantum amplitudes, the infinite-spin limit gives classical amplitudes that serves as building block that we feed into the unitarity method to construct the 2-to-2 one-loop amplitude. We give scalar box, vector box, and scalar triangle coefficients to all orders in spin, where the latter are expressed in terms of Bessel-like functions. Using the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, the classical 2PM impulse is computed, and in parallel we work out the scattering angle and eikonal phase. We give novel all-orders-in-spin formulae for certain contributions, and the remaining ones are given up to ${\cal O}(S^{11})$. Since Kerr 2PM dynamics beyond ${\cal O}(S^{\ge 5})$ is as of yet not completely settled, this work serves as a useful reference for future studies.</description>

      <title>Gravitization Equation and Zero Energy Momentum Tensor Theorem with Cancellation Law in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the essential properties of gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) based on spin gauge symmetry, using the general theory of quantum electrodynamics as an example. A constraint equation for the field strength of the gravigauge field is derived, serving as a gravitization equation within the spin-related gravigauge spacetime. This equation reveals how gravitational effects emerge from the non-commutative relation of the gravigauge derivative operator. By transmuting the action from gravigauge spacetime to Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that translational invariance results in a vanishing energy-momentum tensor in GQFT when the equations of motion are applied to all fundamental fields, including the gravigauge field. This extends the conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor in quantum field theory to a cancellation law of the energy-momentum tensor in GQFT. As a result, an equivalence between the general gravitational equation and the zero energy-momentum tensor theorem naturally arises in GQFT. Certain aspects of the Poincar\'e gauge theory are also briefly discussed. Furthermore, a GQFT incorporating the Chern-Simons action in three-dimensional spacetime is developed, based on the inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry WS(1,2) and the global Poincar\'e symmetry PO(1,2). This framework provides a basis for exploring its connection to Witten's perspective on three-dimensional gravity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear coupling between magnetar QPOs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes, we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic field geometry.</description>

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current gravitational-wave detectors have achieved remarkable sensitivity around 100 Hz, enabling ground-breaking discoveries. Enhancing sensitivity at higher frequencies in the kilohertz (kHz) range promises access to rich physics, particularly the extreme conditions during the merger stage of binary neutron stars. However, the high-frequency sensitivity of Michelson-based interferometers is fundamentally limited by their linear optical cavities, which are optimized for low-frequency signal enhancement. In [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)], a new configuration employing an L-shaped optical resonator was proposed to overcome this limitation, offering exceptional sensitivity in the kHz band. As a pathfinder, the 12-meter prototype at Beijing Normal University is designed to demonstrate the sensing and control schemes of this new kHz detector configuration and to explore its performance in the high-power regime with suspended optics. Beyond its primary scientific goal, the prototype also offers potential sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, potentially enabling constraints on exotic sources. This paper presents an overview of the prototype, including its optical design and current development status of key components.</description>

      <title>Optimal parameterizations for observational constraints on thawing dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-varying dark energy is often modeled in observational analyses through generic parameterizations of its equation of state $w(z)$, which typically use two free parameters $\{w_0, w_a\}$ to span a broad range of behaviors as a function of redshift. However, this broad range of behaviors can only approximately capture the dynamics of any given microphysical theory of dark energy. A complementary approach is to use targeted parameterizations designed to model specific classes of dynamical dark energy with greater precision. Focusing on the class of thawing dark energy, we quantify and compare the precision with which nineteen generic and targeted parameterizations can capture the dynamics of physically motivated thawing quintessence theories. We find that a targeted parameterization derived from a Pad\'e expansion of $w$ is the most reliable of these, producing accurate reconstructions of $w(z)$, the expansion history $H(z)$, and cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ for a broad range of microphysical theories.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} &lt; 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of synthetic null hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a synthetic framework for the geometric and analytic study of null (lightlike) hypersurfaces in non-smooth spacetimes. Drawing from optimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality theory, we define a \emph{synthetic null hypersurface} as a triple $(H, G, \mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$ is a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged measure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to potentially singular spacetimes.
  A central object is the \emph{synthetic null energy condition} ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional along optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This condition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural equivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the smooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$) is the stability under convergence of synthetic null hypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area theorem. Moreover, we extend the celebrated Penrose's singularity theorem to continuous spacetimes and prove the existence of trapped regions in the general setting of topological causal spaces satisfying the synthetic ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$).</description>

Abstract: This work revises the Brane World Theory known as Randall-Sundrum with the modification of an exponential, redshift-dependent brane tension. This model is studied in a scenario assuming no dark energy, with the aim of determining whether it can reproduce the universe's acceleration on its own, without the addition of a dark energy fluid. Bayesian statistical analysis is performed in order to constrain the free parameters of each scenario using SLS, SNIa, OHD, and BAO data samples, the last two considering newly added data points. Both Planck and Riess priors for h are used and compared. In both cases, we are able to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion in agreement with observational data. Interesting consistencies at the transition redshift zt with LCDM are found, suggesting that this might be a suitable model for studying the evolution of the universe up to the present date. However, some pathologies are detected in this model, namely a "Big Rip" divergence of H(z) at z = 1, as well as a strong dependence between the functional form of the brane tension and the future evolution of the universe.</description>
