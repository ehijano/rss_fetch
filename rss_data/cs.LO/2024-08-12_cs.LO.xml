      <title>Algorithms for Markov Binomial Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algorithms to analyze a particular class of Markov population processes that is often used in epidemiology. More specifically, Markov binomial chains are the model that arises from stochastic time-discretizations of classical compartmental models. In this work we formalize this class of Markov population processes and focus on the problem of computing the expected time to termination in a given such model. Our theoretical contributions include proving that Markov binomial chains whose flow of individuals through compartments is acyclic almost surely terminate. We give a PSPACE algorithm for the problem of approximating the time to termination and a direct algorithm for the exact problem in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation. Finally, we provide a natural encoding of Markov binomial chains into a common input language for probabilistic model checkers. We implemented the latter encoding and present some initial empirical results showcasing what formal methods can do for practicing epidemilogists.</description>

      <title>Complete Dynamic Logic of Communicating Hybrid Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a relatively complete proof calculus for the dynamic logic of communicating hybrid programs dLCHP. Beyond traditional hybrid systems mixing discrete and continuous dynamics, communicating hybrid programs feature parallel interactions of hybrid systems. This not only compounds the subtleties of hybrid and parallel systems but adds the truly simultaneous synchronized evolution of parallel hybrid dynamics as a new challenge. To enable compositional reasoning about communicating hybrid programs nevertheless, dLCHP combines differential dynamic logic dL and assumption-commitment reasoning. To maintain the logical essence of dynamic logic axiomatizations, dLCHP's proof calculus presents a new modal logic view onto ac-reasoning. This modal view drives a decomposition of classical monolithic proof rules for parallel systems reasoning into new modular axioms, which yields better flexibility and simplifies soundness arguments. Adequacy of the proof calculus is shown by two completeness results: First, dLCHP is complete relative to the logic of communication traces and differential equation properties. This result proves the new modular modal view sufficient for reasoning about parallel hybrid systems, and captures modular strategies for reasoning about concrete parallel hybrid systems. The second result proof-theoretically aligns dLCHP and dL by proving that reasoning about parallel hybrid systems is exactly as hard as reasoning about hybrid systems, continuous systems, or discrete systems. This completeness result reveals the possibility of representational succinctness in parallel hybrid systems proofs.</description>

      <title>Approximate Distributed Monitoring under Partial Synchrony: Balancing Speed and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed systems with processes that do not share a global clock, \emph{partial synchrony} is achieved by clock synchronization that guarantees bounded clock skew among all applications. Existing solutions for distributed runtime verification under partial synchrony against temporal logic specifications are exact but suffer from significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose an \emph{approximate} distributed monitoring algorithm for Signal Temporal Logic (STL) that mitigates this issue by abstracting away potential interleaving behaviors. This conservative abstraction enables a significant speedup of the distributed monitors, albeit with a tradeoff in accuracy. We address this tradeoff with a methodology that combines our approximate monitor with its exact counterpart, resulting in enhanced efficiency without sacrificing precision. We evaluate our approach with multiple experiments, showcasing its efficacy in both real-world applications and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Base Embeddings: Semantics and Theoretical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on knowledge graph embeddings has recently evolved into knowledge base embeddings, where the goal is not only to map facts into vector spaces but also constrain the models so that they take into account the relevant conceptual knowledge available. This paper examines recent methods that have been proposed to embed knowledge bases in description logic into vector spaces through the lens of their geometric-based semantics. We identify several relevant theoretical properties, which we draw from the literature and sometimes generalize or unify. We then investigate how concrete embedding methods fit in this theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>MSO Queries on Trees: Enumerating Answers under Updates Using Forest Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a framework for maintaining forest algebra representations that are of logarithmic height for unranked trees. Such a representations can be computed in O(n) time and updated in O(log(n)) time. The framework is of potential interest for data structures and algorithms for trees whose complexity depend on the depth of the tree (representation). We provide an exemplary application of the framework to the problem of efficiently enumerating answers to MSO-definable queries over trees which are subject to local updates. We exhibit an algorithm that uses an O(n) preprocessing phase and enumerates answers with O(log(n)) delay between them. When the tree is updated, the algorithm can avoid repeating expensive preprocessing and restart the enumeration phase within O(log(n)) time. Our algorithms and complexity results in the paper are presented in terms of node-selecting tree automata representing the MSO queries.</description>

      <title>Integrating Loop Acceleration into Bounded Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is a powerful technique for proving unsafety. However, finding deep counterexamples that require a large bound is challenging for BMC. On the other hand, acceleration techniques compute "shortcuts" that "compress" many execution steps into a single one. In this paper, we tightly integrate acceleration techniques into SMT-based bounded model checking. By adding suitable "shortcuts" on the fly, our approach can quickly detect deep counterexamples. Moreover, using so-called blocking clauses, our approach can prove safety of examples where BMC diverges. An empirical comparison with other state-of-the-art techniques shows that our approach is highly competitive for proving unsafety, and orthogonal to existing techniques for proving safety.</description>

      <title>Modular Assurance of Complex Systems Using Contract-Based Design Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing number of safety-critical industries agree that building confidence in complex systems can be achieved through evidence and structured argumentation framed in assurance cases. Nevertheless, according to practical industry experience, assurance cases can easily become too rigorous and difficult to develop and maintain when applied to complex systems. Therefore, we propose to use contract-based development (CBD), a method to manage complexity originally developed in computer science, to simplify assurance cases by modularizing them. This paper will not only summarize relevant previous work such as constructing consistent modular assurance cases using CBD, but more importantly also propose a novel approach to integrate CBD with the argumentation in assurance case modules. This approach will allow subject-matter and domain experts to build assurance case modules together without having to know CBD. This can help a broader application of these methods in industry because subject matter experts outside of computer science can contribute to cross disciplinary co-development of assurance cases without having to learn CBD. Industry experience has proven four rules of thumb helpful for developing high-quality assurance cases. This article illustrates their usefulness and explains how modular assurance enables assurance that accounts for the interdependency of different concerns such as safety, security and performance.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Data-Free Nfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nfer is a Runtime Verification language for the analysis of event traces that applies rules to create hierarchies of time intervals. This work examines the complexity of the evaluation and satisfiability problems for the data-free fragment of nfer. The evaluation problem asks whether a given interval is generated by applying rules to a known input, while the satisfiability problem asks if an input exists that will generate a given interval. By excluding data from the language, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for the evaluation problem and for satisfiability when only considering inclusive rules. Furthermore, we show decidability for the satisfiability problem for cycle-free specifications and undecidability for satisfiability of full data-free nfer.</description>

      <title>Semantical Analysis of Intuitionistic Modal Logics between CK and IK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intuitionistic modal logics considered between Constructive K (CK) and Intuitionistic K (IK) differ in their treatment of the possibility (diamond) connective. It was recently rediscovered that some logics between CK and IK also disagree on their diamond-free fragments, with only some remaining conservative over the standard axiomatisation of intuitionistic modal logic with necessity (box) alone. We show that relational Kripke semantics for CK can be extended with frame conditions for all axioms in the standard axiomatisation of IK, as well as other axioms previously studied. This allows us to answer open questions about the (non-)conservativity of such logics over intuitionistic modal logic without diamond. Our results are formalised using the Coq Proof Assistant.</description>

      <title>On the Satisfaction Probabilities of $k$-CNF Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08895v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The satisfaction probability Pr[$\phi$] := Pr$_{\beta:vars(\phi) \to \{0,1\}}[\beta\models \phi]$ of a propositional formula $\phi$ is the likelihood that a random assignment $\beta$ makes the formula true. We study the complexity of the problem $k$SAT-Pr$_{&gt;p}$ = {$\phi$ is a $k$CNF formula | Pr[$\phi$] &gt; p} for fixed $k$ and $p$. While 3SAT-Pr$_{&gt;0}$ = 3SAT is NP-complete and SAT-Pr$_{&gt;1/2}$ is PP-complete, Akmal and Williams recently showed that 3SAT-Pr$_{&gt;1/2}$ lies in P and 4SAT-Pr$_{&gt;1/2}$ is NP-complete; but the methods used to prove these striking results stay silent about, say, 4SAT-Pr$_{&gt;3/4}$, leaving the computational complexity of $k$SAT-Pr$_{&gt;p}$ open for most $k$ and $p$. In the present paper we give a complete characterization in the form of a trichotomy: $k$SAT-Pr$_{&gt;p}$ lies in AC$^0$, is NL-complete, or is NP-complete. The proof of the trichotomy hinges on a new order-theoretic insight: Every set of $k$CNF formulas contains a formula of maximum satisfaction probability. This deceptively simple statement allows us to (1) kernelize $k$SAT-Pr$_{\ge p}$ for the joint parameters $k$ and $p$, (2) show that the variables of the kernel form a backdoor set when the trichotomy states membership in AC$^0$ or NL, and (3) prove locality properties for $k$CNF formulas $\phi$, by which Pr[$\phi$] &lt; $p$ implies that Pr[$\psi$] &lt; $p$ holds already for a subset $\psi$ of $\phi$'s clauses whose size depends only on $k$ and $p$, and Pr[$\phi$] = $p$ implies $\phi \equiv \psi$ for some $k$CNF formula $\psi$ whose size once more depends only on $k$ and $p$.</description>

      <title>The Distributional Uncertainty of the SHAP score in Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attribution scores reflect how important the feature values in an input entity are for the output of a machine learning model. One of the most popular attribution scores is the SHAP score, which is an instantiation of the general Shapley value used in coalition game theory. The definition of this score relies on a probability distribution on the entity population. Since the exact distribution is generally unknown, it needs to be assigned subjectively or be estimated from data, which may lead to misleading feature scores. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for reasoning on SHAP scores under unknown entity population distributions. In our framework, we consider an uncertainty region that contains the potential distributions, and the SHAP score of a feature becomes a function defined over this region. We study the basic problems of finding maxima and minima of this function, which allows us to determine tight ranges for the SHAP scores of all features. In particular, we pinpoint the complexity of these problems, and other related ones, showing them to be NP-complete. Finally, we present experiments on a real-world dataset, showing that our framework may contribute to a more robust feature scoring.</description>

      <title>Axiomatizing NFAs Generated by Regular Grammars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subclass of nondeterministic Finite Automata generated by means of regular Grammars (GFAs, for short) is introduced. A process algebra is proposed, whose semantics maps a term to a GFA. We prove a representability theorem: for each GFA $N$, there exists a process algebraic term $p$ such that its semantics is a GFA isomorphic to $N$. Moreover, we provide a concise axiomatization of language equivalence: two GFAs $N_1$ and $N_2$ recognize the same regular language if and only if the associated terms $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively, can be equated by means of a set of axioms, comprising 7 axioms plus 2 conditional axioms, only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis starts from a very basic data structure comprising objects and their attributes. Sometimes, however, it is beneficial to also define attributes of attributes, viz., meta-attributes. In this paper, we use Triadic Formal Concept Analysis, a triadic approach to Formal Concept Analysis, to develop a framework for this kind of meta-modelling in Formal Concept Analysis, including formal definitions and appropriate visualizations.</description>
