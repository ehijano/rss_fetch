      <title>Evolving the Productivity Equation: Should Digital Labor Be Considered a New Factor of Production?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the digital economy grows increasingly intangible, traditional productivity measures struggle to capture the true economic impact of artificial intelligence (AI). AI systems capable of cognitive work significantly enhance productivity, yet their contributions remain obscured within the residual category of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). This paper explores whether it is time for a conceptual shift to explicitly recognize "digital labor," the autonomous cognitive capability of AI, as a distinct factor of production alongside capital and human labor. We outline the unique economic properties of digital labor, including scalability, intangibility, self-improvement, rapid obsolescence, and elastic substitutability. By integrating digital labor into growth models (such as those by Solow and Romer), we demonstrate strategic implications for business leaders, including new approaches to productivity tracking, resource allocation, investment strategy, and organizational design. Ultimately, treating digital labor as an independent factor offers a clearer view of economic growth and helps organizations manage AI's transformative potential.</description>

      <title>Statistical Decision Theory with Counterfactual Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical statistical decision theory evaluates treatment choices based solely on observed outcomes. However, by ignoring counterfactual outcomes, it cannot assess the quality of decisions relative to feasible alternatives. For example, the quality of a physician's decision may depend not only on patient survival, but also on whether a less invasive treatment could have produced a similar result. To address this limitation, we extend standard decision theory to incorporate counterfactual losses--criteria that evaluate decisions using all potential outcomes. The central challenge in this generalization is identification: because only one potential outcome is observed for each unit, the associated risk under a counterfactual loss is generally not identifiable. We show that under the assumption of strong ignorability, a counterfactual risk is identifiable if and only if the counterfactual loss function is additive in the potential outcomes. Moreover, we demonstrate that additive counterfactual losses can yield treatment recommendations that differ from those based on standard loss functions, provided that the decision problem involves more than two treatment options.</description>

      <title>Quota Mechanisms: Finite-Sample Optimality and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quota mechanism, such as a mandatory grading curve, links together multiple decisions. We analyze the performance of quota mechanisms when the number of linked decisions is finite and the designer has imperfect knowledge of the type distribution. Using a new optimal transport approach, we derive an ex-post decision error guarantee for quota mechanisms. This guarantee cannot be improved by any mechanisms without transfers. We quantify the sensitivity of quota mechanisms to errors in the designer's estimate of the type distribution. Finally, we show that quotas are robust to agents' beliefs about each other.</description>

      <title>Checking Cheap Talk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a sender--receiver game in which the receiver's action is binary and the sender's preferences are state-independent. The state is multidimensional. The receiver can select one dimension of the state to check (i.e., observe) before choosing his action. We identify a class of influential equilibria in which the sender's message reveals which components of the state are highest, and the receiver selects one of these components to check. The sender can benefit from communication if and only if she prefers one of these equilibria to the no-communication outcome. Similar equilibria exist when the receiver can check multiple dimensions.</description>
