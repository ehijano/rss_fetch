      <title>Surfactants Screen Slide Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water drops spontaneously accumulate charges when they move on hydrophobic dielectric surfaces by slide electrification. On the one hand, slide electrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny devices. On the other hand, the potential of up to 1 KV generated by slide electrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to know the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants affect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops containing cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different hydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly reduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop impact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression of charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which reduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid interface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic surfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the liquid-air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions within the drop. (4) Deposited cationic surfactant directly reduces the charge of the drop.</description>

      <title>Subcritical Pitchfork Bifurcation Transition of a Single Nanoparticle in Strong Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement influences fluid properties. We show, employing molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvents, that slit confinement drives a first-order transition for a small nanoparticle between staying at the slit center and binding to the slit surfaces. The transition follows a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation, accompanying a similar transition of the nanoparticle's lateral diffusion, depending on interparticle interactions and confinement interfaces. Our findings underscore the necessity for advancing molecular hydrodynamics under strong confinement.</description>

      <title>Surface forces and frictional properties of adsorbed bio-based cationic polysaccharide thin films in salted aqueous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-surface forces mediated by polymer films are important in a range of technological and industrial situations. In cosmetics, applications such as hair conditioning typically rely on the adsorption of polyelectrolyte films onto the charged surface of hair fibers, whose contact mechanics and tribological properties are central in determining the final sensorial perceptions associated with the cosmetic treatment. A major current challenge to be tackled by the cosmetic industry is to design high-performance products employing bio-sourced polyelectrolytes, with the aim of achieving eco-sustainable processes and products. In this context, the present study focuses on the mechanical properties of thin films obtained by adsorption from solution of fungal chitosan onto negatively charged mica surfaces. We use a Surface Forces Apparatus allowing for the simultaneous measurement of film thickness and friction force as a function of the applied normal load and shear velocity. We show that, in aqueous medium at an ionic strength of 40 mM, adsorbed films of chitosan give rise to repulsive inter-surface forces whose range, comparable to the Flory radius of the macromolecules, increases with the polymer molecular weight. In addition, the adsorbed layers are found to behave, under compressive forces, as pseudo-brushes of neutral polymers. Finally, we show that under shear forces, chitosan layers exhibit a transition from a low to a high friction regime under increasing confinement.</description>

      <title>Shape transitions of sedimenting confined droplets and capsules: from oblate to bullet-like geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport and deformation of confined droplets and flexible capsules are central to diverse phenomena and applications, from biological flows in microcapillaries to industrial processes in porous media. We combine experiments and numerical simulations to investigate their shape dynamics under varying levels of confinement and particle flexibility. A transition from an oblate to a bullet-like shape is observed at a confinement threshold, independent of flexibility. A fluid-structure interaction analysis reveals two regimes: a pressure-dominated and a viscous-dominated regime. For highly flexible particles, the pressure-dominated regime prevails and the deformation is enhanced. These findings offer new insights into the transport of flexible particles in confined environments, with implications for biomedical applications, filtration technologies, and multiphase fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>The protein escape process at the ribosomal exit tunnel has conserved mechanisms across the domains of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ribosomal exit tunnel is the primary structure affecting the release of nascent proteins at the ribosome. The ribosomal exit tunnels from different species have elements of conservation and differentiation in structural and physico-chemical properties. In this study, by simulating the elongation and escape processes of nascent proteins at the ribosomal exit tunnels of four different organisms, we show that the escape process has conserved mechanisms across the domains of life. Specifically, it is found that the escape process of proteins follows the diffusion mechanism given by a simple diffusion model and the median escape time positively correlates with the number of hydrophobic residues and the net charge of a protein for all the exit tunnels considered. These properties hold for twelve distinct proteins considered in two slightly different and improved G\=o-like models. It is also found that the differences in physico-chemical properties of the tunnels lead to quantitative differences in the protein escape times. In particular, the relatively strong hydrophobicity of the E. coli's tunnel and the unusually high number of negatively charged amino acids on the tunnel's surface of H. marismortui lead to substantially slower escapes of proteins at these tunnels than at those of S. cerevisisae and H. sapiens.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dynamic Bonds on the Kinetic Pathways of Supramolecular Diblock Copolymers Disorder-Order Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supramolecular block copolymers (SBC) consist of covalent polymer building blocks that are connected into well-defined architectures via supramolecular bonds. Assisted by the dynamic and reversible supramolecular interactions, it is envisaged that SBC self-assemblies may exhibit more diverse morphologies, stimuli-responsivity comparing to their covalent analogues. At the fundamental level, these features are related to the free-energy landscape of self-assemblies. It is therefore of central importance to understand the impact of dynamic/reversible bonds on the free energy landscape during structure transitions. In this study, we first conduct smart Monte Carlo simulations to compare the kinetics of the disorder-order transition (DOT) of supramolecular diblock copolymers (SDBC) to that of covalent diblock copolymers (CDBC). The structural order parameter for CDBC exhibits a fast and smooth transition process across different random number seeds and initial configurations. In contrast, the SDBC system shows more diverse transition pathways, which can be classified into three types. These results suggest that reversible supramolecular interactions complicate the pathways, and bring about various intermediate structures. Next, we apply the string method to construct the minimum free energy path of the transition, from which the transition state and the free energy barrier are evaluated. It is found that the transition free energy barrier strongly correlates with the fraction of supramolecules. By decomposing the free energy into A-B interaction energy and association energy, we found that the interplay of both two effects decide the kinetic pathway and the final equilibrium structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present experiments, supported by mechanically detailed simulations, establishing bulk vapor-liquid condensation of a hard-bead fluid by a tiny population of orientable motile grains that self-assembles into a moving polarized monolayer. In a quasi-1D geometry two such layers, oppositely aligned, immobilize the condensed non-motile component. We account for our observations through a continuum theory with a naturally non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard structure, whose predicted trends as a function of packing fraction are consistent with our observations.</description>

      <title>Competing aggregation and iso-density equilibrium lead to band pattern formation in density gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centrifugation of biological matter in density gradient solutions is a standard method for separating cell types or components. It is also used to separate red blood cells (RBCs) by age, as they lose water and become denser over their lifespan. When the density gradient is prepared with Percoll, discrete bands of RBCs are systematically observed along the gradient, despite the continuous density distribution of RBCs. Early studies suggested that cell aggregation might influence spatial distribution, but it remains debated whether a continuous density population can form discrete bands. We developed a continuity equation incorporating cell aggregation to describe the macroscopic evolution of RBC volume fraction in a density gradient, considering a continuous RBC density distribution. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the competition between isodensity distribution and aggregation is sufficient to create band patterns. Our model reproduces the temporal evolution observed in experiments, but also predicts several types of bifurcation-like behaviors for the steady-state patterns in constant gradients, depending on RBC volume fraction and aggregation energy. This demonstrates that the competition between RBC aggregation and iso-density distribution is a novel mechanism driving pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Understanding process-structure-property relation for elastoplastic behavior of polymer nanocomposites with agglomeration anomalies and gradient interphase percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For polymer nanocomposites, disordered microstructural nature makes processing control and tailoring properties to desired values a challenge. Understanding process-structure-property relation can provide guidelines for process and constituents design. Our work explores nuances of PSP relation for polymer nanocomposites with attractive pairing between particles and polymer bulk. In the absence of any nano or micro-scale local property measurement, we develop a material model that can represent decay for small strain elastoplastic properties in interfacial regions and simulate representative or statistical volume element behavior. This interfacial model is further combined with a microstructural design of experiments for agglomerated nanocomposite systems. Agglomerations are particle aggregations that are microstructural defects resulting from lack of processing control. Twin screw extrusion process can reduce extent of aggregation in hot pressed samples via erosion or rupture depending on screw rpms and toque. We connect this process-structure relation to structure-property relation that emerges from our study. We discover that balancing between local stress concentration zone and interfacial property decay governs how fast yield stress can improve if we break down agglomeration via erosion. Rupture is relatively less effective in helping improve nanocomposite yield strength. Additionally, we allude to yield initiation and progression in these multiphase materials. We have come up with a field quantity called local yield resistance that indicates balance stress concentration zones and interfacial effects. Yield resistance map from linear regime acts as a predictor of local yielding process and can be a useful tool for interface design for plastic deformation behavior.</description>

      <title>Collective Behavior and Memory States in Flow Networks with Tunable Bistability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multistability-induced hysteresis has been widely studied in mechanical systems, but such behavior has proven more difficult to reproduce experimentally in flow networks. Natural flow networks like animal and plant vasculature exhibit complex nonlinear behavior to facilitate fluid transport, so multistable flows may inform their functionality. To probe such phenomena in an analogous model system, we utilize an electronic network of hysterons designed to have tunable negative differential resistivity. We demonstrate our system's capability to generate complex global memory states in the form of voltage patterns. The tunable nonlinearity of each element's current-voltage characteristic allows us to navigate this space of hysteretic behavior, and can be utilized to engineer more complex networks with exotic effects such as avalanches and multiperiodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active polymers respond to spatial activity gradients by autonomously migrating, a behavior central to biological self-organization and the design of intelligent synthetic materials. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structure and propulsion direction of tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs) determine their collective response to activity gradients. We show that TDAP assemblies exhibit strikingly different behaviors based on their organization: inward-directed arms form compact bundles that accumulate in low-activity regions, whereas outward-directed arms assemble into asters that undergo directed motion toward high-activity regions. Remarkably, mixed structures, comprising both inward- and outward-directed arms, display enhanced accumulation in the high-activity regions due to cooperative effects. In addition, we show that two-arm polymers accumulate within a finite-width active slab embedded in a passive background, and as the slab narrows, the polymers reorient perpendicular to the slab boundaries to remain within the active regions. Our results establish a fundamental link between polymer geometry and emergent transport, providing key design principles for programmable active materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological cells exhibit a hierarchical spatial organization, where various compartments harbor condensates that form by phase separation. Cells can control the emergence of these condensates by affecting compartment size, the amount of the involved molecules, and their physical interactions. While physical interactions directly affect compartment binding and phase separation, they can also cause oligomerization, which has been suggested as a control mechanism. Analyzing an equilibrium model, we illustrate that oligomerization amplifies compartment binding and phase separation, which reinforce each other. This nonlinear interplay can also induce multistability, which provides additional potential for control. Our work forms the basis for deriving thermodynamically consistent kinetic models to understand how biological cells can regulate phase separation in their compartments.</description>
