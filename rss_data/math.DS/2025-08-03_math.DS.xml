      <title>Unique equilibrium states for Viana maps with small potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic formalism for Viana maps-skew products obtained by coupling an expanding circle map with a slightly perturbed quadratic family on the fibers. For every H\"older potential $\varphi$ whose oscillation is below an explicit threshold, we show that an equilibrium state not only exists but is unique and satisfies an upper level-2 large-deviation principle. All of these conclusions persist under sufficiently small perturbations of the reference map.</description>

      <title>$C^1$ invariant and inertial manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent article by Carvalho et al. [J. Differential Equations 416 (2025)] presents in a~unified framework the Lyapunov--Perron construction of invariant and inertial manifolds together with the saddle point property. We extend their results on the existence of non-autonomous inertial manifolds by considering the gap condition which is known to be sharp. Moreover, we show that the constructed inertial manifolds have $C^1$ regularity.</description>

      <title>Flexibility versus genericity of phase diagrams of perturbed continuous maps on the Cantor set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the dynamical system constitued by a continuous function $F:\mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N}\to\mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite alphabet. The perturbed counterpart, denoted by $F_\epsilon$, is obtained after each iteration of $F$ by modifying each cell independently with probability $\epsilon\in[0,1]$ and choosing the new value uniformly. We characterize the possible sets of $\epsilon\in[0,1]$ such that $F_\epsilon$ has a unique measure. These sets are exactly the $G_\delta$ sets (countable intersection of open sets) of $[0, 1]$ which contain 1. However, we show that generically this set is $]0, 1]$.</description>

      <title>Slow convergence almost everywhere of ergodic averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ergodic action of the group $Z^n$ on a probability space and a given arbitrarily slowly decreasing to zero sequence, there exists an integrable function such that the standard ergodic time averages for it converge almost everywhere to the spatial average of the function at a rate that is not asymptotically majorized by this sequence. This generalizes the Krengel effect about the absence of universal estimates for the rate of convergence in Birkhoff's ergodic theorem. The proof uses a weakened version of Rokhlin's lemma for ergodic $Z^n$-actions. It ensures the existence of the required sequence of asymptotically almost invariant sets with given measures. A feature of the construction of such a sequence is that the choice of the next almost invariant set depends on the original function and on the choice of the previous invariant sets. A significant deviation of the ergodic averages from the mean of a positive function can be uniformly realized over extremely large time intervals. The deviation can be greater than a positive constant and differ little from it on arbitrary long time intervals. We not only can achieve the specified deviations arbitrarily far, but the sequence of such deviations from the average can be realized as a sequence wanishing arbitrarily slowly.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of Halley's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the global dynamics of Halley's method applied to complex polynomials. Specifically, we analyze the structure and connectivity of the Julia set of this method. The convergence behavior, symmetry properties, and topological features of the corresponding Fatou and Julia sets are studied for various classes of polynomials, including unicritical, cubic, and quartic polynomials with non-trivial symmetry groups. In particular, we prove that the Halley's method $H_p$ is convergent, its Julia set is connected, the immediate basins are unbounded and the symmetry group of it coincides with that of the polynomial whenever $p$ belongs to one of the above classes. We further extend our results to a broader class of polynomials. It is shown that the immediate basin of the Halley's method $H_p$ corresponding to a root of $p$ can be bounded. We also make some remarks on the dynamics of the Halley's method applied to a cubic polynomial in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability is a fundamental concept that refers to a system's ability to return close to its original state after disturbances. The minimal conditions for stability when system parameters vary in time, though common in physics, have been largely overlooked. Here, we study the minimal amount of periodic stiffness a linear mass-spring system requires to remain stable and apply our findings to optimally trap the upside-down state of a compass in a time-varying magnetic field. We show that the ability to return close to its original state only needs to be ensured over small but precisely defined durations within each period for the system to achieve dynamic stability. These precise durations form a discrete set, remarkably predicted by rules analogous to those of quantum mechanics. This unexpected connection opens new avenues for controlling dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the connectedness of isoperiodic moduli spaces of meromorphic differentials with at least three simple poles on homologically marked smooth curves whose periods are either not contained in a real line, or not contained in the rational space generated by the peripheral periods. From this topological property we deduce dynamical properties of the underlying foliation in the moduli space meromorphic differentials, by describing leaf closures associated to those spaces.</description>

      <title>Partial Floquet Transformation and Model Order Reduction of Linear Time-Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as engineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing) with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems. Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.</description>

      <title>Doubling property of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Yang, Yuan and Zhang [Doubling properties of self-similar measures and Bernoulli measures on self-affine Sierpinski sponges, Indiana Univ. Math. J., 73 (2024), 475-492] characterized when a self-similar measure satisfying the open set condition is doubling. In this paper, we study when  a self-similar measure with overlaps is doubling. Let $m\geq 2$ and let  $\beta&gt;1$ be the Pisot number satisfying $\beta^m=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\beta^j$. Let  $\mathbf{p}=(p_1,p_2)$ be a probability weight and let $\mu_{\mathbf{p}}$ be the self-similar measure associated to the IFS $\{ S_1(x)={x}/{\beta}, S_2(x)={x}/{\beta}+(1-{1}/{\beta}),\}.$ Yung [...,Indiana Univ. Math. J., ] proved that when $m=2$, $\mu_{\mathbf{p}}$ is doubling if and only if $\mathbf{p}=(1/2,1/2)$. We show that for $m\geq 3$, $\mu_{\mathbf{p}}$ is always non-doubling.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called ``projective decomposition''. The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred canonical coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse square and inverse cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. From these solutions, a new set of orbit elements for Kepler-Coulomb dynamics is derived, along with their variational equations for arbitrary perturbations (singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion). Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the $J_2$ gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Mapping dynamical systems into chemical reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polynomial dynamical systems (DSs) can model a wide range of physical processes. A special subset of these DSs that can model chemical reactions under mass-action kinetics is called chemical dynamical systems (CDSs). A fundamental problem, central to synthetic biology, is to map polynomial DSs into dynamically similar CDSs. In this paper, we introduce the quasi-chemical map (QCM) that can systematically solve this problem. The QCM introduces suitable state-dependent perturbations into any given polynomial DS which then becomes a CDS under sufficiently large translations of variables. This map preserves robust features, such as generic equilibria and limit cycles, and generic bifurcations, as well as some temporal properties, such as periods of oscillations. Furthermore, the resulting CDSs are at most one degree higher than the original DSs. We showcase the QCM by designing relatively simple CDSs with oscillations, chaos and bifurcations, and addressing Hilbert's 16th problem in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Generalized L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorems and a Conjecture of Y. Cheung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated L\'evy--Khintchine theorem is a fundamental limiting law that describes the growth rate of the denominators of the convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a Lebesgue-typical real number. In a recent breakthrough, Cheung and Chevallier \textit{(Annales scientifiques de l'ENS, 2024)} extended this theorem to higher dimensions.
  In this paper, we resolve a conjecture of Y. Cheung and answer a question of Cheung and Chevallier concerning L\'evy--Khintchine type theorems for arbitrary norms. We also establish a higher-dimensional analogue of the Doeblin--Lenstra law.
  While our results are new in higher dimensions, they also yield significant improvements in the classical one-dimensional setting. Specifically, we revisit the L\'evy--Khintchine theorem and the Doeblin--Lenstra law through the lens of Mahler's influential proposal to study Diophantine approximation on fractals. In particular, we prove these results for almost every point on the middle-third Cantor set. More broadly, our framework applies to a wide class of measures, including those supported on curves and on self-similar fractals generated by iterated function systems (IFS), and it also allows constraints on the selection of best approximates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Latent Diffeomorphic Dynamic Mode Decomposition (LDDMD), a new data reduction approach for the analysis of non-linear systems that combines the interpretability of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) with the predictive power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Notably, LDDMD maintains simplicity, which enhances interpretability, while effectively modeling and learning complex non-linear systems with memory, enabling accurate predictions. This is exemplified by its successful application in streamflow prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Floquet theory allows to map a time-periodic system of linear differential equations into an autonomous one. By looking at it in a geometrical way, we extend the theory to a class of non-autonomous non-periodic equations. This is obtained by considering a change of variables which depends on time in a non-trivial way, i.e. introducing gauge transformations, well known in fundamental Physics and Field Theory -- but which seems to have received little attention in this context.</description>
