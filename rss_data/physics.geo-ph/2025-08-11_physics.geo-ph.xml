      <title>Scaling of strong-field spherical dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical experiments of dynamo action designed to understand the generation of Earth's magnetic field produce different regime branches identified within bifurcation diagrams. Notable are distinct branches where the resultant magnetic field is either weak or strong. Weak-field solutions are identified by the prominent role of viscosity (and/or inertia) on the motion, whereas the magnetic field has a leading-order effect on the flow in strong-field solutions. We demonstrate the persistence of the strong-field branch, preserving the expected force balance of Earth's core, and provide scaling laws governing its onset as parameters move toward values appropriate for the Geodynamo. We introduce a new output parameter, based on dynamically important parts of rotational and magnetic forces, that captures expected $O(1)$ values of strong-field solutions throughout input parameter space. This new measure of the field strength and our bounds on scaling laws can guide future studies in locating strong-field dynamos in parameter space.</description>

      <title>The effect of induced flow on the water wave skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear wave-induced perturbations are discussed within the framework of the second-order theory. Due to the slow attenuation of the long perturbations with depth, they modulate motions beneath surface waves down to the bottom and can strongly affect the wave statistics. The disturbance which corresponds to the second harmonic, at a sufficient depth inverses the phase, thereby qualitatively changes the shape of individual waves. The skewness coefficients of the surface displacement and the bottom pressure fluctuations are considered. It is shown that the bottom pressure skewness may have different signs and magnitudes depending on the water depth and the configuration of nonlinear wave groups which compose the wave field. The effect on the surface displacement skewness is much weaker. Mechanisms leading to strong deviation of the skewness coefficient from the nonlinear Stokes wave theory are discussed.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Mineral-water reactions in Earth's mantle: Predictions from Born theory and ab initio molecular dynamics" by Fowler et al. 2024 (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 372, 111-123)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comment addresses discrepancies in dielectric constant calculations of water under extreme conditions (~10 GPa and 1000 K) between Fowler et al.'s recent study [Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 372, 111-123 (2024)] and the earlier work by Pan et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 110, 6646-6650 (2013)]. Through reproduced ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations using the CP2K code with extended duration and identical system size, we rigorously validate that Pan et al.'s original results (39.4) are well-converged, contrasting with Fowler et al.'s reported value of 51. The observed discrepancy cannot be attributed to simulation duration limitations, but rather to methodological differences in dipole moment calculation. Our analysis highlights critical issues in the treatment of dipole moment fluctuations in periodic systems within the framework of modern theory of polarization. This clarification has significant implications for modeling mineral-water interactions in Earth's mantle using Born theory.</description>

      <title>Covariance based estimates of near-boundary diapycnal upwelling in a submarine canyon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct covariance estimates of temperature flux from a conventional taut wire mooring placed in a narrow submarine canyon on the continental slope west of Ireland. Estimates of stratification from both moored sensors and vertical profiling instrumentation are used to facilitate the interpretation of these temperature transport estimates in terms of diathermal upwelling. At depths of 50-125 meters above bottom, the temperature flux is up-gradient, rather than down the mean gradient, and the corresponding vertical divergence of the diathermal temperature flux implies a diapycnal velocity of approximately 1 mm/s, consistent with diathermal migration estimated from a dye release study. Cospectra document that the temperature flux is related to a wave breaking process under-pinned by semi-diurnal frequencies. This up-gradient flux also results in a highly non-local temperature variance budget. We demonstrate that nonlinear temperature variance production at the bottom boundary is the root cause, with redistribution aloft determining the temperature flux profile.</description>

      <title>Heat conduction with phase change in soils with macro-pores, snow, and cryoconite. Part I: unified model derivation and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend models of thermal conduction with phase transition from micro- to macro-scale. Such models were previously developed for soils in permafrost regions from pore to Darcy scale, and the Darcy scale models compare well to empirical relationships. The new general model blends soil model with bulk water model and thus works well for the soils with macro-pores; it also applies to new context including modeling thermal conduction in the snow and in cryoconite, and it is consistent with rigorous thermodynamics derivations as well as with practical models from the literature. From mathematical point of view, the general model relies on carefully defined relationships between temperature, phase fraction and internal energy, which we show are invertible in a properly defined framework of multivalued graphs. We also discuss and test practical models for average heat conductivity. Our framework allows to create monolithic numerical models useful for modeling of coupled soil and snow models as well as cryoconite. We motivate and illustrate the results with practical examples and computations.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in the Geomagnetic Field at Earth Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated turbulence-like behavior in the geomagnetic field using ground-based magnetic observatory data across China. Through analysis of spatial and temporal structure functions, we find power-law scaling consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence under extended self-similarity. We also identify significant correlations between vertical geomagnetic field variations and large earthquakes. The combination of turbulent characteristics with these correlations suggests a physical mechanism where solar activity provides energy that is transferred through turbulent processes to smaller scales, potentially contributing to earthquake triggering.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>
