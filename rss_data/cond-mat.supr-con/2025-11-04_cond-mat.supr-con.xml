      <title>Chimeric states of matter: Meissner effect without superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is central to how we classify phases of matter: solids break spatial translations, superfluids break particle-number conservation, and superconductors "break" gauge symmetry. Mixed anomalies involving higher-form symmetries, however, present a generalization of spontaneous symmetry breaking that admits a wider and more versatile set of possibilities. We introduce chimeric states of matter, in which aspects of broken and unbroken phases coexist. We find that the Meissner effect -- usually regarded as the defining hallmark of superconductivity -- can occur in media that are resistive or even insulating when probed by electric fields. We demonstrate this by constructing an effective field theory of "symmetry chimerization" and propose that Josephson junction networks could provide a laboratory realization. These results broaden the landscape of possible phases of matter, showing that physical media can mix features of symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken states in a single substrate.</description>

      <title>Cu-spin Correlation in the Electron-overdoped High-Tc Cuprate Thin Films of La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_ Probed by Low-energy Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the Cu-spin correlation in the overdoped regime of the electron-doped high-Tc cuprate thin films of La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_, changing the reduction condition from muon spin relaxation using low-energy muons. The Cu-spin correlation developed at low temperatures for optimally reduced films with x=0.13 as well as x=0.17 where the superconductivity was almost suppressed. These results are contrary to those observed in the hole-doped high-Tc cuprates where the development of the antiferromagnetic Cu-spin correlation disappears together with the suppression of superconductivity. The Cu-spin correlation developed at low temperatures in x=0.17 may be understood in terms of antiferromagnetism, but it may be related to a ferromagnetic order recently suggested in the nonsuperconducting heavily overdoped La$_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_ with x~0.18.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity in 1$T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity in bulk transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a fascinating area of research, as their weak interlayer coupling leads to novel superconducting behavior and offers a rich platform to host nontrivial gap structures and interactions with other electronic orders. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the superconducting properties of bulk single-crystalline $1T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$ for x = 0.2. Our results confirm the weakly coupled anisotropic superconductivity. Angle-dependent upper critical field measurements and observation of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition confirm the quasi-2D nature of the superconducting state. These results position $1T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring low-dimensional superconducting physics and highlight bulk TMD crystals as a promising platform for realizing intrinsic 2D superconductivity, opening avenues for future quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Conventional and practical metallic superconductivity arising from repulsive Coulomb coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A concrete question is discussed: Can there be conventional $s$-wave superconductivity in regular 3D metals, i.e., electrons in a jellium background, interacting via the standard Coulomb coupling? We are interested in 'practical' superconductivity that can in principle be observed in experiments, so the $T=0$ ground state being superconducting is not of interest, or for that matter a $T_c$ which is exponentially small and therefore 'impractical' is also not of interest in the current work. We find that almost any theory based on the BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg paradigm, with some form of screened Coulomb coupling replacing the electron-phonon coupling in the BCS or Eliashberg theory, would uncritically predict absurdly high $T_c\sim100$ K in all metals (including the alkali metals, which are well-described by the jellium model) arising from the unavoidable fact that the Fermi, plasmon, and Coulomb potential energy scales are all $&gt;10^4$ K. Therefore, we conclude, based on reduction ad absurdum, that the violation of the venerable Migdal theorem in this problem is sufficiently disruptive that no significance can be attached to numerous existing theoretical publications in the literature claiming plasmon-induced (or other similar Coulomb coupling-induced) practical SC. Using a careful analysis of the Eliashberg gap equations we find that the superconducting $T_c$ of the 3D electron gas can be reduced below the $\sim1$ K range depending on choices of frequency and momentum cut-off parameters that are introduced to satisfy Migdall's theorem but are apriori unknown. The only believable result is the one discovered sixty years ago by Kohn and Luttinger predicting non-$s$-wave SC arising from Friedel oscillations with exponentially (and unobservably) low $T_c$. We provide several theoretical approaches using both BCS and Eliashberg theories and different screening models to make our point.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in a skyrmion-coupled high-temperature Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a planar Josephson junction having $d$-wave superconducting regions, with a skyrmion crystal placed underneath, produces a robust gate-tunable superconducting diode effect. The spatially-varying exchange field of the skyrmion crystal breaks both inversion and time-reversal symmetries, leading to an asymmetric current-phase relation with an anomalous phase shift. Our theoretical calculations, obtained using resistively and capacitively shunted junction model combined with Bogoliubov-de Gennes method, reveal that the diode efficiency is largely tunable by controlling external gate voltage and skyrmion radius. Incorporation of a $d$-wave superconductor such as high-$T_c$ Cuprate enables the diode to function at higher operating temperatures. Our results establish a unique and practically-realizable mechanism for devising tunable field-free superconducting diodes based on magnetic texture-superconductor hybrid platforms.</description>

      <title>Time Reversal Symmetry Broken Electronic Phases in Thin Films of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductors (high-Tc SCs) host a rich landscape of electronic phases encompassing the pseudogap, strange metal, superconducting, antiferromagnetic insulating, and Fermi-liquid regimes. The superconducting phase is notable for non-dissipative electronic functionality at relatively high temperatures. These phases are commonly probed in thermodynamic phase space by varying temperature or current through the sample. They can also be probed by breaking time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with an external magnetic field, which yields transition signatures distinct from those arising solely from temperature or current tuning. Here we show that electron transport in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ is primarily governed by two-dimensional superconductivity consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) topological phase transition, as supported by current-voltage characteristics measured under temperature variation; these measurements preserve TRS. In contrast, when an external magnetic field is applied, the superconducting state is consistently preceded by weak antilocalization (WAL), where bound vortex-antivortex pairs dissociate into a normal metallic state through an intermediate localized phase. We further establish that highly disordered films exhibit transport dominated by three-dimensional weak localization, with superconductivity entirely suppressed.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Chiral Anisotropy in Josephson Diode Effect of All-Metallic Lateral Junctions with Interfacial Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the role of interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for the Josephson diode effect in all-metal diffusive Josephson junctions. Devices with Fe/Pt and Cu/Pt weak links between Nb leads reveal a Josephson diode effect in an in-plane magnetic field with magneto-chiral anisotropy according to the symmetry of Rashba SOC. The Rashba SOC originates from inversion symmetry breaking at the metal-metal interfaces. A control sample with a plain Cu-layer as weak link exhibits also a finite diode efficiency that, in contrast, is independent of the angle between current and field. The Fraunhofer patterns display an apparent inverted hysteresis which can be traced back to stray fields resulting from the conventional hysteretic vortex pinning in the Nb contacts.</description>

      <title>Instability toward Superconducting Stripe Phase in Altermagnets with Strong Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate finite-momentum superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric metallic altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-splitting and strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. Focusing on a stripe phase in which Cooper pairs acquire multiple center-of-mass momenta, we construct phase diagrams that reveal phase boundaries between the stripe phase and a helical phase characterized by a single center-of-mass momentum. Our results show that the stripe phase emerges at low temperatures and exhibits a reentrant behavior as a function of the strength of the altermagnetic splitting. We further analyze the stripe phase within a linearized gap equation, and uncover the mechanism of the pairing formation unique to the stripe phase. This mechanism originates from the anisotropic deformation of the Fermi surfaces induced by the altermagnetic splitting, highlighting the intriguing interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Field-Tunable Anisotropic Fulde-Ferrell Phase in NbSe$_2$/CrSiTe$_3$ Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides with strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) has opened new avenues for exploring exotic superconducting states. Here, we report experimental observation of an anisotropic Fulde-Ferrell (FF) phase in few-layer NbSe$_2$/CrSiTe$_3$ heterostructures under in-plane magnetic fields. Through combined magnetoresistance and nonreciprocal transport measurements, we find that due to the couplings from the ferromagnetic CrSiTe$_3$, a half-dome-shaped region emerges in the magnetic field-temperature ($B$-$T$) diagram. Importantly, the half-dome-shaped region exhibits finite second harmonic resistance with in-plane anisotropy, indicating that the superconducting state is an anisotropic FF phase. Through a symmetry analysis combined with mean field calculations, we attribute the emergent anisotropic FF phase to the CrSiTe$_3$ layer induced Rashba SOC and three-fold rotational symmetry breaking. These results demonstrate that heterostructure stacking is a powerful tool for symmetry engineering in superconductors, which can advance the design of quantum devices in atomically thin superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Point-contact enhanced superconductivity in trigonal PtBi2: quest for the origin of high-Tc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied enhanced superconductivity in point contacts (PCs) based on a type-I Weyl semimetal t-PtBi2 using both normal metal (Ag, Cu, Pt) and ferromagnetic (Fe, Co, Ni) tips by measuring the differential resistance dV/dI(V) curves. In most cases, the value of the superconducting critical temperature Tc ranges between 3 and 5 K, which is several times higher than the maximal bulk Tc. At the same time, among dozens of PCs with higher Tc, a few of them reach Tc up to 8 K, including those with both normal and ferromagnetic tips. The critical magnetic field is also highly enhanced in PCs and reaches up to several Tesla. The common reason for the Tc increase may be related to pressure/strain caused at the PC's formation. Moreover, a greater increase in Tc is observed for PCs formed at the edge of the sample flake than for those formed on the plane. The results also reveal that the growth of Tc in PCs based on t-PtBi2 is compatible with ferromagnetism in Fe, Co, and Ni tips, initiating discussion as to the possible non-trivial nature of enhanced superconductivity. Anyway, our findings suggest that t-PtBi2 is a promising candidate for realizing topological superconductivity at more accessible temperatures</description>

      <title>Novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism in a spin triplet superconductor -- Application to UTe$_2$--</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is theoretically proposed in a spin triplet superconductor (SC) with equal spin pairs. We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient states of matter far from equilibrium may exhibit physical properties beyond those allowed by the equilibrium-state crystalline symmetries. We explore ultrafast and direct electronic excitations of transient states in a cavity superconductor by using time-resolved terahertz-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. Our results show that the strong terahertz field can transiently modify the symmetries of the electronic subsystems via the injection of a transient supercurrent, leading to high-order nonlinear dynamical responses that are not compatible with the equilibrium-state symmetries, which evidences for transient symmetry breaking on the picosecond time scale. Our study also finds that the strong coupling of the superconductor to the designed microcavities enables the sensitive detection of the nonlinear responses associated to the transient symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Current-Gated Orthogonal Superconducting Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport in superconductors enables rectification but is usually limited to the longitudinal direction. In this work, we show that a direct current bias injected off principal axes in two-dimensional anisotropic superconductors converts anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, enabling supercurrent diode effect measurement. This is demonstrated within both a Ginzburg-Landau framework and self-consistent mean-field calculations. When the control bias exceeds its critical value, the transverse dissipationless currents can only flow unidirectionally. This mechanism motivates the design of a multi-terminal current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST) and yields simple, bias direction angle-dependent design rules for device optimization. As direct applications, we propose a tunable supercurrent range controller and a half-wave rectifier based on the CGOST. Our findings open new avenues for developing nonreciprocal superconducting electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining density functional theory (DFT) and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we investigate the unusual pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in the nickelate superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Using the hopping integrals and on-site potentials obtained by fitting the DFT band structures, we map a quantum phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model with increasing pressure in a ladder geometry, which has an intermediate Hubbard repulsion and a Hund's coupling. Near $3/8$ filling, we find a strong spin density wave order, which at $3/8$ filling shows a real-space spin pattern similar to the spin-charge stripe order along a lattice direction. At $21/64$ filling, we find a superconducting phase with interlayer superconductivity (SC) in both the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as in-plane SC in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Intriguingly, the SC is weakened with increasing pressure and transits to a Luttinger liquid above $80$ GPa, which qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations of decreasing $T_c$ with increasing pressure and a transition to Fermi liquid above $80$ GPa in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparative study, we further show that the ratio of interaction to hopping integral, which reduces moderately with increasing pressure, may play a dominant role in the weakening of SC. Our results of this experimentally relevant model not only find a robust SC through suppressing the competing spin density wave order, but also give new insight into the unusual pressure dependence of SC in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Polariton-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) metals are altered by changes in their three-dimensional dielectric environment. In this Letter we propose that superconductivity can be induced in a 2D metal by resonant coupling between its plasmonic collective modes and optical phonons in a nearby polar dielectric. Specifically, we predict that relatively high-temperature superconductivity can be induced in bilayer graphene twisted to an angle somewhat larger than the magic value by surrounding it with a THz polar dielectric. Our conclusions are based on numerical solutions of Eliashberg equations for massless Dirac fermions with tunable Fermi velocities and Fermi energies, and can be understood qualitatively in terms of a generalized McMillan formula.</description>

      <title>Exchange operation of Majorana zero modes in topological insulator-based Josephson trijunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes are anyons obeying non-Abelian exchange statistics distinct from fermions or bosons. While significant progresses have been achieved in the past two decades in searching for these exotic excitations in solid-state systems, their non-Abelian nature remains unverified, as definitive proof requires braiding operations. Here, we report preliminarily experimental advances in creating, manipulating, and exchanging the presumed Majorana zero modes in an envelope-shaped Josephson device composed of multiple trijunctions on a topological insulator surface. We observed the signatures of in-gap states migration consistent with the expectations of the Fu-Kane model, supporting the realization of an exchange operation. This work would establish a critical pathway toward ultimately braiding Majorana zero modes in the Fu-Kane scheme of topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing magnetic coupling in lumped element superconducting resonators for molecular spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to 100 kHz and collective couplings exceeding 10 MHz. The resonators were made interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single microwire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process has been used to infer the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a 50 nm wide constriction fabricated at the center of its single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by side frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Remote Two-Qubit Gates on Distributed Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing offers a potential solution to the complexity of superconducting chip hardware layouts and error correction algorithms. High-quality gates between distributed chips enable the simplification of existing error correction algorithms. This article proposes and demonstrates a remote quantum geometric gate scheme via parametric modulation. Our scheme inherits the intrinsic robustness of geometric phases. Meanwhile, by employing gradient-based optimization algorithms(Adaptive Moment Estimation) from deep learning, we design control waveforms that significantly suppress population leakage. We experimentally realize the rapid remote SWAP and $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gates with high fidelity, completing operation in about 30 ns. The gate error of SWAP ($\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$) is 1.16\% (0.91\%) after excluding the effect of energy relaxation. The simulation demonstrate that this scheme can be implemented in the distributed chips connected by cables extending several meters. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in enabling modular quantum processors, offering a promising path toward the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and confinement: A new pairing mechanism in high-T_{C} cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02300v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that entanglement and confinement hole pairing (ECHP) is a precise physics of the entanglement framework of the RVB theory of high-Tc cuprates. Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the entire phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of the spin gap and strange metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of the overdoped regions of the superconducting (SC) dome, the presence of the parallel superconducting stripes in the CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and the linear-T behavior of the strange metal phase above the overdoped regions of the SC dome. This also explains the experimental spin textures of the cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement and confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we were able to provide a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the entire phase diagram, thus providing the sought-after mechanism responsible for the entire phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates</description>

      <title>Interplay of Tilt and Axion Fields in Topological Superconductors: Anisotropy in the Meissner Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological superconductors host gapless surface states that fundamentally alter their electromagnetic response through the axion field term $\theta \vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$, arising from the topological magnetoelectric effect. In this work, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of a three-dimensional topological Weyl superconductor by leveraging its theoretical mapping to a four-dimensional topological insulator with s-wave superconducting boundaries. By incorporating the tilt of Weyl cones into this model, we demonstrate that the tilt vector $\vec\zeta$ anisotropically modifies the axion field profile near the surface, leading to a tilt-enhanced Meissner effect and anomalous magnetic penetration depths. We show that the magnetic field component perpendicular to the tilt direction exhibits a non-exponential, hypergeometric decay dictated by the interplay between the axion term and $\vec\zeta$, while the parallel component remains largely tilt-insensitive--a hallmark of axion-mediated anisotropy absent in trivial superconductors. Remarkably, all tilt-dependent electromagnetic responses follow a universal scaling law, revealing a fundamental symmetry in the system's behavior. Furthermore, we predict a tilt-dependent planar Hall current at the surface, directly tied to the topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconducting thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} &gt; 40$ K in {\LNO} (LNO) thin films grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ (SLAO) substrate with compressive ($\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) epitaxial strain provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to unveil the dispersive spin excitations in the LNO/SLAO superconducting thin film and establish the strain dependence of the electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with strain ranging from $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$ to $+1.9\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO/SLAO thin film (with $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and spin dynamics with larger bandwidth. By contrast, tensile-strained LNO/SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon \approx +1.9\%$) exhibits a marked suppression of both the spin excitations and the Ni 3{\dz}-derived $dd$ excitations. The strain dependence of the spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, and the diminishing $dd$ excitations in tensile-strained samples indicate weaker Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. This strain evolution of the spin excitations and $J_z$ is attributed to the strain-tuned $c$-axis Ni-O-Ni bond angle $\varphi$, which controls the Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. Since superconductivity is observed only in films grown on SLAO, and spin correlations are enhanced along with the emergence of superconductivity, our results identify $\varphi$ as a key structural lever controlling $J_z$ and provide direct spectroscopic support for interlayer spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenarios in bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Third harmonic-mediated amplification in TWPA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers, higher-order harmonics of the pump tone and its sidebands are commonly present and typically regarded as parasitic. Consequently, most design efforts have focused on suppressing these harmonics. In spite of that, motivated by transient simulations, we extend the coupled-mode theory and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional belief, the third harmonic can enhance amplifier performance, improving both gain and bandwidth. We show that the recently developed plasma oscillation-based amplifier is particularly well-suited for exploiting this effect. Their dispersion relation enables us to observe the phenomenon in transient numerical simulations using JoSIM and WRspice. These simulations reveal improvement of the amplifier's performance, specifically the doubling of the bandwidth and an increase in the gain.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</description>

      <title>Trotter transition in BCS pairing dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal aspects of thermalization induced by Trotterization, a procedure routinely used in gate-based quantum computation. We use the reduced-BCS model -- quantum integrable with a classically integrable mean-field limit -- where the effects of Trotter chaos are expected to be particularly stark. The resulting Trotterized chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large \(\tau\) limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</description>
