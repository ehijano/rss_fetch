      <title>Three-Dimensional Almost Contact Metric Manifolds Revisited via the Newman-Penrose Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies the Newman-Penrose formalism-a technique primarily used in General Relativity-to the analysis of three-dimensional almost contact metric (ACM) manifolds. We reformulate and discuss several known notions and properties within the Newman-Penrose framework, demonstrating the applicability of the method in this geometric context. Furthermore, as an application showcasing the utility of the formalism, we address the classification of three-dimensional compact normal ACM manifolds, or equivalently trans-Sasakian manifolds, that admit an $\eta$-Einstein metric.</description>

      <title>Complete hypersurfaces in $R^{n+1}$ with constant mean and scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the rigidity problems of complete hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature and constant scalar curvature in Euclidean spaces. Firstly, under some conditions of Gaussian-Kronecker curvature, we provide characterizations for the unsolved cases of N\'u\~nez's theorems in dimensions 4 and 5, as well as several rigidity results under some conditions of $r$-th mean curvatures. Moreover, for the case of dimension 6, we also present analogous rigidity results. Finally, for general dimensions, we offer a rigidity theorem under similar pinching conditions.</description>

      <title>Scaling inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues in space forms and sharp eigenvalue estimates on warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part, we derive monotonicity of the normalized spectra for the second-order Steklov problem and two fourth-order Steklov problems on the $2$-dimensional geodesic disks with respect to the geodesic radius in the sphere and the hyperbolic space. The normalizations are made using four natural geometric factors. As corollaries, we get Escobar-type bounds for Steklov eigenvalues on $2$-dimensional geodesic disks with varying curvature in space forms. We also get two monotonicity results for higher-dimensional cases. In the second part, we obtain some sharp bounds concerning the spectra of the two fourth-order Steklov problems on warped product manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and a strictly convex boundary. In particular, we confirm Qiaoling Wang and Changyu Xia's conjecture (2018) on the sharp lower bound of the first non-zero eigenvalue of a fourth-order Steklov problem in the case of $3$-dimensional warped product manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the Rational Hyperbolicity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a compact simply connected manifold $M$ with a variationally complete $G$-action satisfying certain mild conditions (e.g. trivial principal isotropy, or simply connected principal orbits) is rationally elliptic if and only if $M/G$ is flat. This answers several conjectures and problems regarding the rational homotopy of manifolds with symmetries. On the other hand, without the extra conditions we find examples of rationally elliptic $G$-manifolds $M$ where $M/G$ admits a hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>An index formula for hemispheres of a $C^2$-regular convex closed surface in Euclidean $3$-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carath\'eodory's conjecture has long been regarded as one of the central problems in the classical theory of convex surfaces. In this paper, we establish an index formula for hemispheres of convex closed surfaces under $C^2$-regularity. The proof is based on studying a vertical section of the null hypersurfaces in Lorentz--Minkowski $4$-space associated with the originally given convex surface. As a consequence, the conjecture is affirmatively solved in the $C^2$-case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (negative) gradient vector fields of Morse functions on a compact manifold provide an important example in dynamical system. In this note we prove two important properties of this kind of vector field: Connectedness of critical points through orbits and exponential shrinkage of the flow on stable submanifolds. We also find applications in showing some vanishing results of maps or curvature operators.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of magnetic fields on sub-Riemannian contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by some recent studies of the magnetic Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds, we focus on the first eigenvalue of the magnetic horizontal Laplacian on contact manifolds. We characterize conditions for positive spectral shift, and provide some sharp upper bounds. In the Riemannian setting, a genus 1 assumption is known to force the underlying metric to be flat when equality holds in the sharp upper bounds. Interestingly, we show that the equivalent topological condition in the three--dimensional contact setting consists of having first Betti number equal to 2. In this case, equality in our upper bounds implies that the structure is that of a Heisenberg left--invariant nilmanifold. We conclude by showing that, in some specific three--dimensional contact settings, the knowledge of the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian uniquely determines the manifold Chern class, fully determining the topology of the underlying manifold.</description>

      <title>Complex structures on 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras arising from graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the existence of complex structures on 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras arising from finite graphs. We introduce the notion of adapted complex structure, namely a complex structure that maps vertices and edges of the graph to vertices and edges, and we analyze in depth the restrictions imposed by the integrability condition. We completely characterize the graphs that admit abelian adapted complex structures, showing that they belong to a small family of graphs that we call basic. We prove that any graph endowed with an adapted complex structure $J$ contains a unique $J$-invariant basic spanning subgraph, and conversely, that every such graph can be constructed through a systematic expansion procedure starting from a basic graph. We also explore geometric and combinatorial consequences, including the existence of special Hermitian metrics as well as other graph-theoretic properties.</description>

Abstract: We study rotationally symmetric translators for fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows driven by a curvature function, and we establish the fine asymptotics of bowl-type evolutions and, when admissible, the construction and classification of catenoidal-type solutions, together with their asymptotic behavior. Under natural structural and convexity assumptions, we also prove rigidity and uniqueness results within appropriate classes of graphical translators of such curvature flows.</description>

      <title>Hawksmoor's Ceiling, Mercator's Projection and the Roman Pantheon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ceiling of the Buttery in All Souls College, Oxford, designed by the English Baroque architect Nicholas Hawksmoor, has a vaulted form on an oval base. It is coffered with an array of approximately square sunken lacunaria, whose sizes and positions vary so as to accommodate the constraints of the curved surface and its boundaries. A similar design appears in the dome of the Roman Pantheon. Using methods of differential geometry, we hypothesise that these cofferings should be the images under conformal mappings of regular square tilings of a rectangle or finite cylinder. This guarantees that the coffer ribs meet exactly at right angles and the coffers are close to being square. These mappings are simply the inverse of Mercator's projection of the curved surface onto a plane. For a ceiling which is a general surface of revolution, we derive formulae for the dimensions and location of each coffer. Our results, taking into account camera distortion, are in excellent agreement with photographs of the Hawksmoor ceiling and the Pantheon dome, as well as with recent direct measurements of the latter. We also describe a protocol by which Hawksmoor's ceiling might have been constructed without advanced mathematics.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Friction in Geometric Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric mechanics models of locomotion have provided insight into how robots and animals use environmental interactions to convert internal shape changes into displacement through the world, encoding this relationship in a ``motility map''. A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.
  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities.</description>

      <title>The $\mathrm{L}^p$-index of the Hodge-Dirac operator on compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral and index-theoretic properties of the Hodge-Dirac operator $D = \mathrm{d} + \mathrm{d}^*$ acting on the Banach space $\mathrm{L}^p(\Omega^\bullet(M))$ of differential forms over an oriented compact Riemannian manifold $M$. Relying on the compactness of $M$, we establish the existence of a bounded bisectorial $\mathrm{H}^\infty$ functional calculus for $D$, without curvature assumptions. This result enables us to prove that the triple $(\mathrm{C}(M), \mathrm{L}^p(\Omega^\bullet(M)), D)$ constitutes a compact Banach spectral triple. We then define a consistent pairing between the Banach K-homology and the K-theory of the manifold, proving the invariance of the Fredholm index with respect to $p$. We recover the classical Euler characteristic and the Hirzebruch signature as $\mathrm{L}^p$-indices, demonstrating the effectiveness of Banach noncommutative geometry for geometric analysis, beyond the Hilbertian setting.</description>

      <title>Solving the constraint equation for general free data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the Einstein constraint equations in vacuum by a new method, which allows us to prescribe four scalar quantities, representing the full dynamical degrees of freedom of the constraint system. We show that once appropriate gauge conditions have been chosen and four scalars freely specified (modulo $\ell\leq 1$ modes), we can rewrite the constraint equations as a well-posed system of coupled transport and elliptic equations on $2$-spheres, which we solve by an iteration procedure. Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu. Though in our main theorem, we only specify conditions consistent with $g-g_{Schw}=O(r^{-1-\delta})$, $k=O(r^{-2-\delta})$, the method is flexible enough to be applied in many other situations. It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen. In fact, an important motivation for developing our method is to show that the result of Shen is sharp, i.e., construct small, smooth initial data sets which violate Shen's decay conditions, and for which the stability of the Minkowski space result is wrong.</description>

      <title>Field Theory via Higher Geometry II: Thickened Smooth Sets as Synthetic Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of papers that aim to develop rigorous and most encompassing foundations for field theory, where in the first installment, we laid out the natural formulation of bosonic variational field theory via the functorial geometry of smooth sets. Here, we extend this to the category ThickenedSmoothSets of infinitesimally thickened smooth sets. We first describe the Cahiers topos in a simplified, but fully rigorous, $\mathbb{R}$-algebraic setting -- which should serve as a more accessible introduction to the theory of Synthetic Differential Geometry to both physicists and mathematicians. Then, we formulate local Lagrangian field theory in this rigorous setting in which infinitesimal spaces exist and interact correctly with the field-theoretic spaces of infinite jet bundles, off-shell and on-shell spaces of fields etc.
  This setting subsumes all previous constructions and further recovers all the relevant tangent bundles of traditional (off-shell and on-shell) field theory considerations via the synthetic tangent bundle construction, i.e., as ``infinitesimal curves'' in those spaces, which were previously defined only in an ad-hoc manner. Beyond finally establishing a firm foundation for such aspects of the theory, this approach recognizes the variational principle of local Lagrangian field theory, equivalently, as the intersection of thickened smooth sets. It also suggests the rigorous formalization of perturbative field theory as the restriction to a (synthetic) infinitesimal neighborhood around a field configuration. Furthermore, our context naturally accommodates more general, rigorous considerations, in which the manifolds may have boundaries and corners, a situation that has recently been attracting greater attention in the field-theoretical literature.</description>

      <title>Guillarmou's Normal Operator for Magnetic and Thermostat Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guillarmou's normal operator over a closed Anosov manifold is analogous to the classical normal operator of the geodesic X-ray transform over manifolds with boundary. In this paper, we generalize this normal operator, under some dynamical assumptions, to thermostat flows as well as to the case of the magnetic flows. In particular, we show that these generalized normal operators are elliptic pseudodifferential operators of order -1 in each case. As an application, we prove a stability estimate for the magnetic X-ray transform.</description>

      <title>On construction of differential $\mathbb Z$-graded varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative unital algebra $\mathcal O$, a proper ideal $\mathcal I$ in $\mathcal O$, and a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O/\mathcal I$, we provide a $\mathbb Z$-graded extension, whose negative part is an arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution of $\mathcal O/ \mathcal I$. This extension is obtained through an algorithm exploiting the explicit homotopy retract data of the arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution, so that the number of homological computations in the construction is significantly reduced. For a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O$ that preserves the ideal $\mathcal I$, the extension admits a manifest description in terms of decorated trees and computed data.
  As a by-product, to every Lie--Rinehart algebra over the coordinate ring of an affine variety $ W \subseteq M = \mathbb{C}^d $, one associates an explicit differential $\mathbb{Z}$-graded variety over $M$ whose negative component is the arborescent Koszul--Tate resolution of the coordinate ring $\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_d]/\mathcal I_W$ of $W$, and whose positive component is the universal dg-variety of the given Lie--Rinehart algebra. Concrete examples are given.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Fefferman spaces over CR three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalisation of Fefferman's conformal circle bundle over a contact Cauchy-Riemann three-manifold. These can be viewed as exact `perturbations' of Fefferman's structure by a semi-basic one-form, which encodes additional data on the CR three-manifold.
  We find conditions on the Weyl tensor and the Bach tensor for a Lorentzian conformal four-manifold equipped with a twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics to be locally conformally isometric to such a perturbed Fefferman space.
  We investigate the existence of metrics in the perturbed Fefferman conformal class satisfying appropriate sub-conditions of the Einstein equations, such as the so-called pure radiation equations. These metrics are defined only off cross-sections of Fefferman's circle bundle, and are conveniently expressed in terms of densities that generalise Gover's notion of almost Einstein scales. Our setup allows us to reduce the prescriptions on the Ricci tensor to the underlying CR three-manifold in terms of differential constraints on a complex density and the CR data of the perturbation one-form. One such constraint turns out to arise from a non-linear, or gauged, analogue of a second-order differential operator on densities. A solution thereof provides a criterion for the existence of a CR function and, under certain conditions, for the realisability of the CR three-manifold. These findings are consistent with previous works by Lewandowski, Nurowski, Tafel, Hill, and independently, by Mason.
  We also provide an analysis of the Weyl curvature of such conformal structures in terms of the underlying CR data. In particular, we arrive at a CR formulation of the asymptotic Einstein condition by viewing conformal infinity as a cross-section of Fefferman's circle bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere can be rigid under smooth deformations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We study the weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler equations on mildly singular K\"ahler varieties. Assuming the existence of a suitable resolution of singularities, we establish the existence of singular weighted cscK metrics when the weighted Mabuchi functional is coercive for an extremal weight. This extends the works of Chen-Cheng and He to the singular weighted setting. Moreover, we provide a method for constructing examples of singular cscK metrics inspired by the work of Arezzo-Pacard. In contrast to the usual gluing techniques, our approach does not require a precise understanding about of the metric behavior near the singular locus.</description>

Abstract: We find the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>

Abstract: We show that if a closed manifold of dimension at least four admits a negatively curved metric that is almost Einstein in a suitable sense, then it admits a genuine Einstein metric of negative sectional curvature. Importantly, the pinching constant measuring the almost-Einstein condition neither depends on an upper bound for the diameter or volume, nor on a lower bound for the injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Isometric Splitting of Metrics Without Conjugate Points on $\Sigma \times S^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a global rigidity theorem for Riemannian metrics without conjugate points on three-manifolds of the form $M = \Sigma \times S^1$, where $\Sigma$ is a compact orientable surface of genus at least 2. The main result states that any such metric must be a Riemannian product, with universal cover isometric to $(\mathbb{H}^2, g_0) \times (\mathbb{R}, dt^2)$. This extends the classical Hopf conjecture from tori to this natural class of manifolds with non-abelian fundamental group containing a central $\mathbb{Z}$ factor. We provide two independent proofs: one utilizing the regularity of Busemann functions and stability theory of the Riccati equation along Killing flows, and another based on a detailed analysis of the curvature operator acting on Jacobi fields. We derive sharp geometric inequalities, analyze the deformation space of such metrics, and discuss several geometric and dynamical consequences, including marked length spectrum rigidity, constraints on topological entropy, and incompatibility with non-trivial Sasakian structures.</description>

      <title>Stability and rigidity results of space-like hypersurface in the Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some rigidity theorems for space-like hypersurfaces in Minkowski space by using a Weinberger-type approach with P-functions and integral identities. Firstly, for space-like hypersurfaces $M$ represented as graphs $x_{n+1}=u(x)$ over domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, if higher-order mean curvature ratio $\frac{H_{k}}{H_l}(l&lt;k)$ is constant and the boundary $\partial M$ lies on a hyperplane intersecting with constant angles, then the hypersurface must be a part of hyperboloid. Secondly, for convex space-like hypersurfaces with boundaries on a hyperboloid or light cone, if higher-order mean curvature ratio $\frac{H_{k}}{H_l}(l&lt;k)$ is constant and the angle function between the normal vectors of the hypersurface and the hyperboloid (or the lightcone) on the boundary is constant, then such hypersurfaces must be a part of hyperboloid. These results significantly extend Gao's previous work presented in \cite{Gao1,Gao2}.
  Furthermore, we derive two fundamental integral identities for constant mean curvature (CMC) graphical hypersurfaces $x_{n+1}=u(x)$, $x\in\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, and the boundary lies on a hyperplane. As some applications: we obtain complete equivalence conditions for hyperboloid identification through curvature properties. We also
  establish a geometric stability estimate demonstrating that the square norm of the trace-free second fundamental form $\bar h$ of $M$ is quantitatively controlled by geometric quantities of $\partial\Omega$, as expressed by the inequality: $$ ||\bar h||_{L^2(\Omega)}\leq C(n,K)||H_{\partial\Omega}-H_0||_{L^1(\partial\Omega)}^{1/2}. $$
  Here, $H_{\partial\Omega}$ is the mean curvature of $\partial\Omega$, $H_0$ is some reference constant and $C$ is a constant.
  Finally, analogous estimates are established.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and Schwarz Lemmas in Calibrated Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has two main objectives. First, for an arbitrary calibrated manifold $(X,\phi)$, we define notions of $R_\phi$-hyperbolicity and $\phi$-hyperbolicity, which respectively generalize the notions of Kobayashi and Brody hyperbolicity from complex geometry. To make sense of the former, we introduce the "KR $\phi$-metric," a decreasing Finsler pseudo-metric that specializes to the Kobayashi-Royden pseudo-metric in the Kahler case. We prove that $R_\phi$-hyperbolicity implies $\phi$-hyperbolicity, and give examples showing that the converse fails in general. Moreover, for constant-coefficient, inner Mobius rigid calibrations $\phi$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we completely characterize those domains that are $\phi$-hyperbolic.
  Second, we derive a Schwarz lemma for Smith immersions (a.k.a. conformal $\phi$-curves) into an arbitrary calibrated manifold $(X, \phi)$, thereby extending the Schwarz lemma for holomorphic curves into Kahler manifolds. The relevant Bochner formula features the "$\phi$-sectional curvature," a new notion that includes both the scalar and holomorphic sectional curvatures as special cases. As an application, we prove that calibrated geometries with $\phi$-sectional curvature bounded above by a negative constant are $R_\phi$-hyperbolic, generalizing the corresponding result from complex geometry. As another application, we calculate the KR $\phi$-metric of real, complex, and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces equipped with their natural calibrations.</description>

      <title>Local Topological Constraints on Berry Curvature in Spin--Orbit Coupled BECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a local topological obstruction to flattening Berry curvature in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), valid even when the global Chern number vanishes. For a generic two-component SOC BEC, the extended parameter space $M=T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}\times S^{1}_{\phi_{+}}\times S^{1}_{\phi_{-}}$ carries a natural metric connection $\nabla^{C}$ whose torsion 3-form encodes the synthetic gauge fields. Its harmonic part defines a mixed cohomology class $ [\omega]\in\bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}})\otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{+}})\bigr)\oplus\bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}})\otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{-}})\bigr), $ whose mixed tensor rank equals one. Using a general geometric bound for metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds, we show that the obstruction kernel $\mathcal{K}$ vanishes, yielding the sharp inequality $\dim\mathfrak{hol}^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^{C})\geq 1$. This forces at least one off-diagonal curvature operator, preventing complete gauging-away of Berry phases even when the total Chern number is zero. This provides the first cohomological lower bound certifying locally irremovable curvature in SOC BECs beyond the Chern-number paradigm.</description>

      <title>A Spinorial Heat Flow Framework for Geometric Degeneration on $3$-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a spinor-driven formulation of geometric evolution on closed $3$-manifolds, in which the spinor field is treated as the primary dynamical variable and the Riemannian metric is induced conformally by the spinor amplitude. We introduce a spinorial heat flow governed by the squared Dirac operator, \[ \partial_t \psi = - D_{g(\psi)}^{\,2} \psi , \] where the metric $g(\psi)$ depends nonlinearly on the evolving spinor field. As a consequence, the resulting system is quasi-linear and parabolic away from the nodal set $\{\psi=0\}$, while exhibiting degenerate behavior at vanishing spinor amplitude.
  We show that degeneration of the induced metric corresponds analytically to nodal behavior of the spinor field, rather than to curvature blow-up of the spinor evolution itself. This observation motivates an interpretation of geometric singularities as spinorial nodal transitions, across which the spinor field remains locally bounded in a weak or weighted sense. The induced metric evolution is derived explicitly and shown to be purely conformal, capturing only the trace component of curvature evolution and containing additional gradient terms that are not controlled \emph{a priori}. Accordingly, the proposed flow should not be identified with the Ricci flow, and any analogy with curvature smoothing is understood at a heuristic level.
  The present work establishes a coherent analytical framework for studying geometric degeneration via spinor dynamics and highlights several open problems in degenerate parabolic theory, including rigorous existence results and the precise role of nodal structures in geometric and topological evolution.</description>

      <title>Graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature without quadrilaterals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The definition of Ricci curvature on graphs was given in Lin-Lu-Yau, Tohoku Math., 2011, which is a variation of Ollivier, J. Funct. Math., 2009. Recently, a powerful limit-free formulation of Lin-Lu-Yau curvature using the graph Laplacian has been given in M\"{u}nch-Wojciechowski, Adv. Math., 2019. Let $F_k$ be the friendship graph obtained from $k$ triangles by sharing a common vertex and $T$ be the graph obtained from a triangle and $K_{1,3}$ by adding a matching between every leaf of $K_{1,3}$ and a vertex of the triangle. In this paper, we classify all the simple connected $C_4$-free graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature for minimum degree at least 2: the cycles $C_3,C_5$, the friendship graphs $F_2,F_3$, the line graph of Peterson graph, and $T$.</description>

      <title>A large data semi-global existence and convergence theorem for vacuum Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a semi-global existence and convergence theorem for the $(3+1)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M} \sim M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold of negative Yamabe type. In constant mean curvature transported spatial coordinates, we show that solutions arising from a class of arbitrarily large initial data converge to a Riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature in infinite Newtonian-like `time'. A main novelty is to uncover a new weak null-type structure (different from the well known null structure in the literature) in the field equations induced by the positive cosmological constant in constant mean curvature gauge that is absent in pure vacuum. As a consequence, the Einstein-$\Lambda$ flow generically fails to produce geometrization in the sense of Thurston. Our results affirm a conjecture of Ringstr\"om concerning the asymptotic in-distinguishability of spatial topology in the large data regime of Einstein-$\Lambda$ dynamics. A related result is established for positive Yamabe type under a technical condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this third work in a series, we prove the local-in-time well-posedness of the IBVP for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with twisted DIrichlet boundary conditions on a finite timelike boundary. The boundary conditions consist of specification of the pointwise conformal class of the boundary metric, together with a scalar density involving a combination of the volume form of the bulk metric restricted to the boundary together with the volume form of the boundary metric itself.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between inverse scattering for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds and the Calder\'on problem for the Conformal Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we use the relation obtained by Guillarmou--Guillop\'e and Chang--Gonz\'alez between the generalized eigenvalue problem for asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) manifolds and the Conformal Laplacian, to obtain a new inverse scattering result: on an AH manifold of dimension $n+1$ with constant scalar curvature $-n(n+1)$, we show that the scattering matrix at energy $\frac{n+1}{2}$ determines the jet of the metric on the boundary, up to a diffeomorphism and conformal factor.</description>

      <title>St\"ackel and Eisenhart lifts, Haantjes geometry and Gravitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study lifts of integrable systems by means of generalized St\"ackel geometry. To this aim, we present the notion of St\"ackel lift as a unified setting for the construction of new classes of integrable Hamiltonian systems of physical interest. The St\"ackel lift extends the geometric framework underlying both the Riemannian and the Lorentzian-type classical Eisenhart lifts. Moreover, we prove that Hamiltonian systems constructed through momentum-dependent St\"ackel matrices are naturally endowed with a non-trivial symplectic-Haantjes structure.
  We further illustrate applications to magnetic systems separable in cylindrical coordinates; we describe them within the St\"ackel framework by means of modified St\"ackel basis.
  We also show that explicitly momentum-dependent lifting matrices produce systems interpretable as gravitational waves, or momentum-dependent metrics of Hamilton and Finsler geometries, with potential applications in modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>On the foundations and applications of Lorentz-Finsler Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finslerian extensions of Special and General Relativity -- commonly referred to as Very Special and Very General Relativity -- necessitate the development of a unified Lorentz-Finsler geometry. However, the scope of this geometric framework extends well beyond relativistic physics. Indeed, it offers powerful tools for modeling wave propagation in classical mechanics, discretizing spacetimes in classical and relativistic settings, and supporting effective theories in fundamental physics. Moreover, Lorentz-Finsler geometry provides a versatile setting that facilitates the resolution of problems within Riemannian, Lorentzian, and Finslerian geometries individually. This work presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts, key applications, and future prospects. The reviewed topics include (i) basics on the setting of cones, Finsler and Lorentz-Finsler metrics and their (nonlinear, anisotropic and linear) connections, (ii) the global structure of Lorentz-Finsler manifolds and its space of null geodesics, (iii) links among Riemannian, Finsler and Lorentz geometries, (iv) applications in classical settings as wildfires and seisms propagation, and discretization in classical and relativistic settings with quantum prospects, and (v) Finslerian variational approach to Einstein equations. The new results include the splitting of globally hyperbolic Finsler spacetimes, in addition to the analysis of several extensions of the Lorentz setting, as the case of timelike boundaries.</description>

      <title>Geometric Theory of Quark Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the nonperturbative solution of the loop equation in quenched QCD (one quark loop in full gluon vacuum, including nonplanar graphs). This solution relies on a specific local minimum of the Plateau problem -- one that is additive over the closed parts of the bounding loop formed at self-intersections. This surface applies to large loops, leading to quark confinement via a factor $\exp(-\kappa S[C])$ multiplying the perturbative Wilson loop $W_{pert}[C]$. Crucially, the confinement mechanism relies on the self-duality of the area derivative -- a property that exists exclusively in four dimensions. This geometric constraint ensures stability only in four dimensions, distinguishing the resulting spectrum from standard string models, which are stable only in higher embedding dimensions. We compute the high-energy meson spectrum resulting from this novel confinement mechanism. The result is a usual linear Regge trajectory with the slope $\alpha' = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma}$ in our normalization of string tension $\sigma = 2 \sqrt{2} \kappa$. However, there are no string modes to be added to the spectrum in our solution, which amounts to the static linear potential for the quark pair. As we argue, the fluctuations of ``flux tube'' between quarks are accounted for in the gluon diagrams in $W_{pert}[C]$, and do not contribute to the confining force. This eliminates the problems of quantization of string in four dimensions.</description>
