      <title>Product of Brauer--Manin obstruction for 0-cycles over number fields and function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conjectured that the Brauer--Manin obstruction is expected to control the existence of 0-cycles of degree 1 on smooth proper varieties over number fields. In this paper, we prove that the existence of Brauer--Manin obstruction to Hasse principle for 0-cycles of degree 1 on the product of smooth (non-necessarily proper) varieties is equivalent to the simultaneous existence of such an obstruction on each factor. We also prove an analogous statement for smooth varieties defined over function fields of $\mathbb{C}((t))$-curves.</description>

      <title>K3 surfaces associated to varieties of generalized Kummer type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To any hyper-K\"ahler variety $K$ of generalized Kummer type is associated via Hodge theory a K3 surface $S_K$. We show how they are related geometrically through a moduli space of sheaves on $S_K$. As a consequence, building fundamentally on the works of O'Grady, Markman, Voisin, Varesco, we establish the Hodge conjecture for all powers of any of these K3 surfaces as well as for all abelian fourfolds of Weil type with discriminant 1 and their powers, strenghtening a result of Markman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of good cohomology for multiple lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$ and we classify multiple lines with good cohomology up to multiplicity 4. In particular, we show that the family of space curves of degree d, not lying on a surface of degree less than d, and of maximal arithmetic genus is not irreducible already for d=4 and d=5.</description>

      <title>Models of hypersurfaces and Bruhat-Tits buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to constructing semistable integral models of hypersurfaces over a discrete non-archimedian field $K$. For each stable hypersurface over $K$ we define a stability function on the Bruhat-Tits building of ${\rm PGL}(K)$ and show that its global minima correspond to semistable hypersurface models over some extension of $K$. This extends work of Kollar and of Elsenhans and Stoll on minimal hypersurface models. In the case of plane curves and residue characteristic zero, our results give a practical algorithm for constructing a semistable model over a suitable extension field.</description>

      <title>Matrix Hessenberg schemes over the minimal sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study families of matrix Hessenberg schemes in the affine scheme of complex $n\times n$ matrices, each defined over a fixed sheet in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{C})$. It is well known that such families over the regular sheet are flat, and every regular Hessenberg scheme degenerates to a regular nilpotent Hessenberg scheme. This paper explores whether flat degenerations exist outside of the regular case.
  For each matrix Hessenberg scheme, we introduce a one-parameter family of matrix Hessenberg schemes that degenerates it to a specific nilpotent Hessenberg scheme. Our main theorem states that, when the family lies over the minimal sheet in $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{C})$, this degeneration is flat. The proof leverages commutative algebra on the polynomial ring to identify the structure of the family concretely, and we explore several applications. We conjecture that flatness holds for these families over other sheets as well.</description>

      <title>Derived characterizations for rational pairs \`{a} la Schwede-Takagi and Koll\'{a}r-Kov\'{a}cs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note establishes derived characterizations for notions of rational pairs \`{a} la Schwede-Takagi and Koll\'{a}r-Kov\'{a}cs. We use a concept of generation in triangulated categories, introduced by Bondal and Van den Bergh, to study these classes of singularities for pairs. One component of our work introduces rational pairs \`{a} la Koll\'{a}r-Kov\'{a}cs for quasi-excellent schemes of characteristic zero, which gives a Kov\'{a}cs style splitting criterion and a Kov\'{a}cs-Schwede style cohomological vanishing result.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of the twofold symmetric product of a Hirzebruch surface via secant maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, extending some ideas of Fano, we study the birational geometry of the Hilbert scheme of 0-dimensional subschemes of length 2 of a rational normal scroll. This fourfold has three elementary contractions associated to the three faces of its nef cone. We study natural projective realizations of these contractions. In particular, given a smooth rational normal scroll $S_{a,b}$ of degree $r$ in ${\mathbb P}^{r+1}$ with $1 \leq a \leq b$ and a+b=r, i.e., $S_{a,b}$ is the relative Proj of the vector bundle $O_{{\mathbb P}^1}(a)\oplus O_{{\mathbb P}^1}(b)$ embedded in ${\mathbb P}^{r+1}$ with its O(1) line bundle (from an abstract viewpoint $S_{a,b}\cong {\mathbb F}_{b-a}$), we consider the subvariety $X_{a,b}$ of the Grassmannian $G(1,r+1)$ described by all lines that are secant or tangent to $S_{a,b}$. The variety $X_{a,b}$ is the image of some of the aforementioned contractions, it is smooth if a&gt;1, and it is singular at a unique point if a=1. We compute the degree of $X_{a,b}$ and the local structure of the singularity of $X_{a,b}$ when a=1. Finally we discuss in some detail the case r=4, originally considered by Fano, because the smooth hyperplane sections of $X_{2,2}$ and $X_{1,3}$ are the Fano 3-folds that appear as number 16 in the Mori-Mukai list of Fano 3-folds with Picard number 2. We prove that any smooth hyperplane section of $X_{2,2}$ is also a hyperplane section of $X_{1,3}$, and we discuss the GIT-stability of the smooth hyperplane sections of $X_{1,3}$ where $G$ is the subgroup of the projective automorphisms of $X_{1,3}$ coming from the ones of $S_{1,3}.$</description>

      <title>Topological and bilipschitz types of complex surface singularities and their links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that two normal complex surface germs that are inner bilipschitz--but not necessarily orientation-preserving--homeomorphic, have in fact the same oriented topological type and the same minimal plumbing graph. Along the way, we show that the oriented homeomorphism type of an isolated complex surface singularity germ determines the oriented homeomorphism type of its link, providing a converse to the classical Conical Structure Theorem. These results require to study the topology first, and the inner lipschitz geometry later, of Hirzebruch-Jung and cusp singularities, the normal surface singularities whose links are lens spaces and fiber bundles over the circle.</description>

      <title>Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

      <title>Resolution of singularities via Tannaka duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving finite quotient singularities is a classical problem in algebraic geometry. Traditional methods of Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) translate the singularity into a quiver representation space and take the GIT quotient with respect to a generic stability parameter. While this approach easily produces smooth resolutions, it fails to produce any stacky resolutions, as quiver representation spaces lack finite stabilizers.
  This paper provides an alternative framework which produces both smooth and stacky resolutions. Our framework is based on a trick of Abdelgadir and Segal, which deploys Tannaka duality to describe the points of the classifying stack of a finite group in terms of algebraic data. Abdelgadir and Segal successfully pursue this strategy and obtain smooth and stacky resolutions in the Kleinian $ D_4 $ case. We generalize this strategy to all Kleinian singularities and obtain a series of varieties which we refer to as Clebsch-Gordan varieties. We provide tools to work with these Clebsch-Gordan varieties, analyze their stable loci with respect to different stability parameters, and study the Kleinian $ A_n $ and $ D_n $ cases in detail.</description>

      <title>The generalized Lelong numbers and intersection theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex manifold of dimension $k,$ and $(V,\omega)$ be a K\"ahler submanifold of dimension $l$ in $X,$ and $B\Subset V$ be a domain with $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth boundary. Let $T$ be a positive plurisubharmonic current on $X$ such that $T$ satisfies a reasonable approximation condition on $X$ and near $\partial B.$ In our previous work we introduce the concept of the generalized Lelong numbers $\nu_j(T,B)\in\mathbb{R}$ of $T$ along $B$ for $0\leq j\leq l.$ When $l=0,$ $V=B$ is a single point $x,$ $\nu_0(T,B)$ is none other than the classical Lelong number of $T$ at $x.$
  This article has five purposes: Firstly, we formulate the notion of the generalized Lelong number of $T$ associated to every closed smooth $(j,j)$-form on $V.$ This concept extends the previous notion of the generalized Lelong numbers. We also establish their basic properties. Secondly, we define the horizontal dimension $\hbar$ of such a current $T$ along $B.$ Next, we characterize $\hbar$ in terms of the generalized Lelong numbers. We also establish a Siu's upper-semicontinuity type theorem for the generalized Lelong numbers. In their above-mentioned context, Dinh and Sibony introduced some cohomology classes which may be regarded as their analogues of the classical Lelong numbers. Our third objective is to generalize their notion to the broader context where $T$ is (merely) positive pluriharmonic. Moreover, we also establish a formula relating Dinh-Sibony classes and the generalized Lelong numbers. Fourthly, we obtain an effective sufficient condition for defining the intersection of $m$ positive closed currents in the sense of Dinh-Sibony's theory of tangent currents on a compact K\"ahler manifold. Finally, we establish an effective sufficient condition for the continuity of the above intersection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is focused on linearizing and found the Lax Pairs of the algebraic complete integrability (a.c.i) Toda lattice associated with the twisted affine Lie algebra \(a_4^{\left(2\right)}\). Firstly, we recall that our case of a.c.i is a two-dimensional algebraic completely integrable systems for which the invariant (real) tori can be extended to complex algebraic tori (abelian surfaces). This implies that the geometry can be used to study this system. Secondly, we show that the lattice is related to the Mumford system and we construct an explicit morphism between these systems, leading to a new Poisson structure for the Mumford system. Finally, we give a new Lax equation for this Toda lattice and we construct an explicit linearization of the system.</description>

      <title>An abelian formula for the quantum Weyl group action of the coroot lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let g be a complex simple Lie algebra and Uq(Lg) its quantum loop algebra, where q is not a root of unity. We give an explicit formula for the quantum Weyl group action of the coroot lattice Q of g on finite-dimensional representations of Uq(Lg) in terms of its commuting generators. The answer is expressed in terms of the Chari-Pressley series, whose evaluation on highest weight vectors gives rise to Drinfeld polynomials. It hinges on a strong rationality result for that series, which is derived in the present paper. As an application, we identify the action of Q on the equivariant K-theory of Nakajima quiver varieties with that of explicitly given determinant line bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of symplectic singularities aims to build a 21st century Lie theory. A key development is the Namikawa-Weyl group, which generalizes the classical Weyl group of Lie algebras. Another cornerstone is the integration of categorical Calabi-Yau techniques, capturing the rich algebraic structure of these singularities. In this paper, we develop a systematic strategy to determine Namikawa-Weyl groups for representation spaces of Calabi-Yau-2 algebras, leveraging local-to-global functors, symmetry analysis, and $ A_{\infty} $-methods. Applying this approach to quiver varieties, we carry out the detailed calculations and recover Yaochen Wu's result.</description>

      <title>On the finiteness of twists of irreducible symplectic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irreducible symplectic varieties are higher-dimensional analogues of K3 surfaces. In this paper, we prove the finiteness of twists of irreducible symplectic varieties via a fixed finite field extension of characteristic $0$. The main ingredient of the proof is the cone conjecture for irreducible symplectic varieties, which was proved by Markman and Amerik--Verbitsky. As byproducts, we also discuss the cone conjecture over non-closed fields by Bright--Logan--van Luijk's method. We also give an application to the finiteness of derived equivalent twists. Moreover, we discuss the case of K3 surfaces or Enriques surfaces over fields of positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>On termination of flips and exceptionally non-canonical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically introduce and study a new type of singularities, namely, exceptionally non-canonical (enc) singularities. This class of singularities plays an important role in the study of many questions in birational geometry, and has tight connections with local K-stability theory, Calabi-Yau varieties, and mirror symmetry.
  We reduce the termination of flips to the termination of terminal flips and the ACC conjecture for minimal log discrepancies (mlds) of enc pairs. As a consequence, the ACC conjecture for mlds of enc pairs implies the termination of flips in dimension $4$.
  We show that, in any fixed dimension, the termination of flips follows from the lower-semicontinuity for mlds of terminal pairs, and the ACC for mlds of terminal and enc pairs. Moreover, in dimension $3$, we give a rough classification of enc singularities, and prove the ACC for mlds of enc pairs. These two results provide a second proof of the termination of flips in dimension $3$ which does not rely on any difficulty function.
  Finally, we propose and prove the special cases of several conjectures on enc singularities and local K-stability theory. We also discuss the relationship between enc singularities, exceptional Fano varieties, and Calabi-Yau varieties with small mlds or large indices via mirror symmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a construction by Yamamoto of tropical contractions, we construct a non-archimedean SYZ fibration on the Berkovich analytification of a class of maximally degenerate hypersurfaces in projective space. We furthermore prove that under a discrete symmetry assumption, the potential for the non-archimedean Calabi-Yau metric is constant along the fibers of the retraction. The proof uses the work of Li on the Fermat degeneration of hypersurfaces, and an explicit description of toric plurisubharmonic metrics on the hybrid space associated to a complex toric variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a complete valuation ring of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ with algebraically closed fraction field $K$ and residue field $k$. Let $X/R$ be a smooth projective morphism. We show that if $X_k$ is stably rational, then $H^3(X_K, \mathbb Z_p)$ is torsion-free. The proof uses integral $p$-adic Hodge theory of Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze and the study of differential forms in positive characteristic. We then apply this result to study the Noether problem for finite $p$-groups.</description>

      <title>$p$-curvature of periodic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$ where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p&gt;0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites and its residues have rational eigenvalues for rational values of parameters. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</description>

      <title>Tjurina spectrum and graded symmetry of missing spectral numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hypersurface isolated singularity defined by $f$, the Steenbrink spectrum can be obtained as the Poincar\'e polynomial of the graded quotients of the $V$-filtration on the Jacobian ring of $f$. The Tjurina subspectrum is defined by replacing the Jacobian ring with its quotient by the image of the multiplication by $f$. We prove that their difference (consisting of missing spectral numbers) has a canonical graded symmetry. This follows from the self-duality of the Jacobian ring, which is compatible with the action of $f$ as well as the $V$-filtration. It implies for instance that the number of missing spectral numbers which are smaller than $(n+1)/2$ (with $n$ the ambient dimension) is bounded by $[(\mu-\tau)/2]$. We can moreover improve the estimate of Brian\c{c}on-Skoda exponent in the semisimple monodromy case.</description>

Abstract: A rigid isotopy of real algebraic curves of a certain class is a path in the space of curves of this class. The paper's study completes the rigid isotopic classification of nonsingular real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) on a hyperboloid, begun by the author in earlier works. There are given the missing proofs of the uniqueness of the connected components for 16 classes of real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) having a single node or a cusp. The main technical tools are graphs of real trigonal curves on Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>Motivic correlators, cluster varieties and Zagier's conjecture on zeta(F,4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.08585v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Zagier's conjecture on the value at s=4 of the Dedekind zeta-function of a number field F. For any field F, we define a map from the appropriate pieces of algebraic K-theory of F to the cohomology of the weight 4 polylogarithmic motivic complex. When F is the function field of a complex variety, composing this map with the regulator map on the polylogarithmic complex to the Deligne cohomology, we get a rational multiple of Beilinson's regulator. This plus Borel's theorem implies Zagier's conjecture. Another application is a formula expressing the value at s=4 of the L-function of an elliptic curve E over Q via generalized Eisenstein-Kronecker series. We get a strong evidence for the part of Freeness Conjecture describing the weight four part of the motivic Lie coalgebra of F via higher Bloch groups. Our main tools are motivic correlators and a new link of cluster varieties to polylogarithms.</description>

Abstract: Assuming a modular version of Schanuel's conjecture and the modular Zilber-Pink conjecture, we show that the existence of generic solutions of certain families of equations involving the modular $j$ function can be reduced to the problem of finding a Zariski dense set of solutions. By imposing some conditions on the field of definition of the variety, we are also able to obtain unconditional versions of this result.</description>

      <title>Deformations of $(p,q)$-forms and degenerations of the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that Hodge numbers are invariant under deformations of complex structures if the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence of the central fiber degenerates at the first page (i.e. $E_1=E_\infty$). As a result, the deformations of $(p,q)$-forms are unobstructed for all $(p,q)$ if $E_1=E_\infty$. We refine this classical result by showing that for any fixed $(p,q)$ the deformations of $(p,q)$-forms are unobstructed if the differentials $d_r^{p,q}$ in the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence satisfy
  \[
  \bigoplus_{r\geq 1}d_r^{p,q}=0\quad\text{and}\quad
  \bigoplus_{ r\geq i\geq 1 } d_r^{p-i,q+i}=0.
  \] Moreover, the deformation stability of the degeneration property for Fr\"olicher spectral sequences in the first page and higher pages is also studied. In particular, we have found suitable conditions to ensure the deformation stability of $E_r^{p,q}=E_\infty^{p,q}$ ($r\geq1$) for fixed $(p,q)$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic aspects of homogeneous Kuramoto oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate algebraic and topological signatures of networks of coupled oscillators. Translating dynamics into a system of algebraic equations enables us to identify classes of network topologies that exhibit unexpected behaviors. Many previous studies focus on synchronization of networks having high connectivity, or of a specific type (e.g. circulant networks). We introduce the Kuramoto ideal; an algebraic analysis of this ideal allows us to identify features beyond synchronization, such as positive dimensional components in the set of potential solutions (e.g. curves instead of points). We prove sufficient conditions on the network structure for such solutions to exist. The points lying on a positive dimensional component of the solution set can never correspond to a linearly stable state. We apply this framework to give a complete analysis of linear stability for all networks on at most eight vertices. Furthermore, we describe a construction of networks on an arbitrary number of vertices having linearly stable states that are not twisted stable states.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing Riemann surfaces of plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical models of Riemann surfaces give full control over computation of the Abel image of any point or divisor. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions at Abel images of given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples. A method of finding the unique characteristic corresponding to the vector of Riemann constants is suggested for non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves.</description>
