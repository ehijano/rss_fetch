      <title>Sufficient conditions for bipartite rigidity, symmetric completability and hyperconnectivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider three matroids defined by Kalai in 1985: the symmetric completion matroid $\mathcal{S}_d$ on the edge set of a looped complete graph; the hyperconnectivity matroid $\mathcal{H}_d$ on the edge set of a complete graph; and the birigidity matroid $\mathcal{B}_d$ on the edge set of a complete bipartite graph. These matroids arise in the study of low rank completion of partially filled symmetric, skew-symmetric and rectangular matrices, respectively. We give sufficient conditions for a graph $G$ to have maximum possible rank in these matroids. For $\mathcal{S}_d$ and $\mathcal{H}_d$, our conditions are in terms of the minimum degree of $G$ and are best possible. For $\mathcal{B}_d$, our condition is in terms of the connectivity of $G$. Our results are analogous to recent results for rigidity matroids due to Krivelevich, Lew and Michaeli, and Vill\'anyi, respectively, but our proofs require new techniques and structural results. In particular, we give an almost tight lower bound on the vertex cover number in critically $k$-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Chamanara Surface from the van der Corput sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family of $4$-regular graphs constructed to test for the presence of combinatorial structure in a sequence of distinct real numbers. We show that the graphs constructed from the Kronecker sequence can be embedded into the torus, while the graphs constructed from the binary van der Corput sequence can be embedded into the Chamanara surface, in both cases with the possible removal of one edge. These results allude to a general theory of sequence graphs which can be embedded into particular translation surfaces coming from interval exchange transformations.</description>

      <title>Robustness for expander graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study robust versions of properties of $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs, namely, the property of a random sparsification of an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph, where each edge is retained with probability $p$ independently. We prove such results for the containment problem of perfect matchings, Hamiltonian cycles, and triangle factors. These results address a series of problems posed by Frieze and Krivelevich.
  First we prove that given $\gamma&gt;0$, for sufficient large $n$, any $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ with $\lambda=o(d)$, $d=\Omega(\log n)$ and $p\ge\frac{(1+\gamma)\log n}{d}$, $G\cap G(n,p)$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle (and thus a perfect matching if $n$ is even) with high probability. This result is asymptotically optimal.
  Moreover, we show that for sufficient large $n$, any $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ with $\lambda=o(\frac{d^2}{n})$, $d=\Omega(n^{\frac{5}{6}}\log^{\frac{1}{2}}n)$ and $p\gg d^{-1}n^{\frac{1}{3}}\log^{\frac{1}{3}} n$, $G\cap G(n,p)$ contains a triangle factor with high probability. Here, the restrictions on $p$ and $\lambda$ are asymptotically optimal.
  Our proof for the triangle factor problem uses the iterative absorption approach to build a spread measure on the triangle factors, and we also prove and use a coupling result for triangles in the random subgraph of an expander $G$ and the hyperedges in the random subgraph of the triangle-hypergraph of $G$.</description>

      <title>How to bound Klarner's constant without (a huge number of) Klarner--Rivest twigs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although known lower bounds for the growth rate $\lambda$ of polyominoes, or Klarner's constant, are already close to the empirically estimated value $4.06$, almost no conceptual progress on upper bounds has occurred since the seminal work of Klarner and Rivest (1973). Their approach, based on enumerating millions of local neighborhoods (``twigs'') yielded $\lambda \le 4.649551$, later refined by Barequet and Shalah (2022) to $\lambda \le 4.5252$ using trillions of configurations. The inefficiency lies in representing each polyomino as an almost unrestricted sequence of twigs once the large set of neighborhoods is fixed.
  We introduce a recurrence-based framework that constrains how local neighborhoods concatenate. Using a small system of convolution-type recurrences, we obtain $\lambda \le 4.5238$. The proof is short, self-contained, and fully verifiable by hand. Despite the marginal numerical improvement, the main contribution is methodological: replacing trillions of configurations with a concise one-page system of recurrences. The framework can be extended, with modest computational assistance, to further tighten the bound and to address other combinatorial systems governed by similar local constraints.</description>

      <title>Tropicalising hypergeometric $\tau$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted Hurwitz numbers arise as coefficients in the power sum expansion of deformed hypergeometric $\tau$--functions. They specialise to essentially all known cases of Hurwitz numbers, including classical, monotone, strictly monotone and completed cycles Hurwitz numbers. In this work, we develop a tropical geometry framework for their study, thus enabling a simultaneous investigation of all these cases. We obtain a correspondence theorem expressing weighted Hurwitz numbers in terms of tropical covers. Using this tropical approach, we generalise most known structural results previously obtained for the aforementioned special cases to all weighted Hurwitz numbers. In particular, we study their polynomiality and derive wall--crossing formulae. Moreover, we introduce elliptic weighted Hurwitz numbers and derive tropical mirror symmetry for these new invariants, i.e. we prove that their generating function is quasimodular and that they may be expressed as Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Kempe equivalence of 4-colourings of some plane triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_{n}$, where $n \geqslant 5$, be a simple plane triangulation which has $2$ non-adjacent vertices of degree $n$ (called \textit{poles} of $G_n$) and $2n$ vertices of degree~$5$.
  A set of Kempe equivalent $4$-colourings of $G_{n}$ is called a \textit{Kempe class}. The number of Kempe classes of $G_{n}$ is enumerated. In particular it is shown that there is at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor$ Kempe classes of $G_{n}$.
  We say that $4$-colourings $A, B$ of $G_{n}$ are \textit{equal} if there exists a permutation~$P$ of the set of colours such that $A = P \circ B$. Otherwise, $A$, $B$ are \textit{different}. The number of different $4$-colourings of $G_{n}$ is enumerated.
  Suppose that $H_{n} = G_{n} - b$, where $b$ is a pole of $G_{n}$. We prove that all $4$-colourings of $H_{n}$ are Kempe equivalent up to
  $\lfloor \frac{13n}{2} \rfloor$ Kempe changes. %$3n$ ($\lfloor \frac{9n}{2} \rfloor$ and $\lfloor \frac{13n}{2} \rfloor$) Kempe changes, for $n \equiv 0\, (mod\, 3)$ ($n \equiv 2\, (mod\, 3)$ and $n \equiv 1\, (mod\, 3)$, respectively).</description>

      <title>On Perrin Cordial Labeling: A New Approach in Graph Labeling Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of \emph{Perrin cordial labeling}, a novel vertex labeling scheme inspired by the Perrin number sequence and situated within the broader framework of graph labeling theory. The Perrin numbers are defined recursively by the relation \( P_n = P_{n-2} + P_{n-3} \), with initial values \( P_0 = 0 \), \( P_1 = 3 \), and \( P_2 = 0 \). A Perrin cordial labeling of a graph \( G = (V, E) \) is an injective function \( f : V(G) \rightarrow \{P_0, P_1, \dots, P_n\} \), where the induced edge labeling \( f^* : E(G) \rightarrow \{0,1\} \) is given by \( f^*(uv) = (f(u) + f(v)) \pmod 2 \). The labeling is said to be cordial if the number of edges labeled \( 0 \), denoted \( e_f(0) \), and the number labeled \( 1 \), denoted \( e_f(1) \), satisfy the condition \( |e_f(0) - e_f(1)| \leq 1 \). A graph that admits such a labeling is called a \emph{Perrin cordial graph}. This study investigates the existence of Perrin cordial labelings in various families of graphs by analyzing their structural properties and compatibility with the proposed labeling scheme. Our results aim to enrich the theory of graph labelings and highlight a new connection between number theory and graph structures.</description>

      <title>Bipartite holes, degree sums and Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\em bipartite-hole-number} of a graph $G$, denoted as $\widetilde\alpha(G)$, is the minimum number $k$ such that there exist integers $a$ and $b$ with $a + b = k+1$ such that for any two disjoint sets $A, B \subseteq V(G)$, there is an edge between $A$ and $B$.
  McDiarmid and Yolov initiated research on bipartite holes by extending Dirac's classical theorem on minimum degree and Hamiltonian cycles.
  They showed that a graph on at least three vertices with $\delta(G) \ge \widetilde\alpha(G)$ is Hamiltonian.
  Later, Dragani\'c, Munh\'a Correia and Sudakov proved that $\delta\ge \widetilde\alpha(G)$ implies that $G$ is pancyclic, unless $G = K_{\frac n2, \frac n2}$. This extended the result of McDiarmid and Yolov and generalized a theorem of Bondy on pancyclicity.
  In this paper, we show that a $2$-connected graph $G$ is Hamiltonian if $\sigma_2(G) \ge 2 \widetilde\alpha(G) - 1$, and that a connected graph $G$ contains a cycle through all vertices of degree at least $\widetilde\alpha(G)$.
  Both results extended McDiarmid and Yolov's result.
  As a step toward proving pancyclicity, we show that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ satisfies $\sigma_2(G) \ge 2 \widetilde\alpha(G) - 1$, then it either contains a triangle or it is $K_{\frac n2, \frac n2}$.
  Finally, we discuss the relationship between connectivity and the bipartite hole number.</description>

      <title>Attractors of sequences coding $\beta$-integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe minimal string attractors of prefixes of simple Parry sequences. These sequences form a coding of distances between consecutive $\beta$-integers in numeration systems with a real base $\beta$. Simple Parry sequences have been recently studied from this point of view and attractors of prefixes have been described. However, the authors themselves had doubts about their minimality and conjectured that attractors of alphabet size should be sufficient. We confirm their conjecture. Moreover, we provide attractors of prefixes of some particular form of binary non-simple Parry sequences.</description>

      <title>Lexical tableaux and quasisymmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a natural bijection between standard immaculate tableaux of composition shape $\alpha \vDash n$ and length $\ell(\alpha) = k$ and the $ \left\{ \begin{smallmatrix} n \\ k \end{smallmatrix} \right\} $ set-partitions of $\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}$ into $k$ blocks, for the Stirling number $ \left\{ \begin{smallmatrix} n \\ k \end{smallmatrix} \right\} $ of the second kind. We introduce a family of tableaux that we refer to as \emph{lexical tableaux} that generalize immaculate tableaux in such a way that there is a bijection between standard lexical tableaux of shape $\alpha \vDash n$ and length $\ell(\alpha) = k$ and the $ \left[ \begin{smallmatrix} n \\ k \end{smallmatrix} \right] $ permutations on $\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}$ with $k$ disjoint cycles. In addition to the entries in the first column strictly increasing, the defining characteristic of lexical tableaux is that the word $w$ formed by the consecutive labels in any row is the lexicographically smallest out of all cyclic permutations of $w$. This includes weakly increasing words, and thus, lexical tableaux provide a natural generalization of immaculate tableaux. Extending this generalization, we introduce a pair of dual bases of the Hopf algebras $\textsf{QSym}$ and $\textsf{NSym}$ defined in terms of lexical tableaux. We present two expansions of these bases, involving the monomial and fundamental bases (or, dually, the ribbon and complete homogeneous bases), using Kostka coefficient analogues and coefficients derived from standard lexical tableaux.</description>

      <title>The intersection densities of transitive actions of $\operatorname{PSL}_{2}(q)$ with cyclic point stabilizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite transitive group $G\leq \operatorname{Sym}{\Omega}$, the {intersection density} of $G$ is defined as the ratio between the size of the largest subsets of $G$ in which any two permutations agree on at least one element of $\Omega$, and the order of a point stabilizer of $G$.
  In this paper, we completely determine the intersection densities of the permutation groups $\operatorname{PSL}_{2}(q)$, where $q$ is a power of an odd prime $p$, acting transitively with point stabilizers conjugate to $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our proof uses an auxiliary graph, which is a $\operatorname{PGL}_{2}{q}$-vertex-transitive graph, in which a clique corresponds to an intersecting set of $\operaotnrame{PSL}_{2}(q)$. For the transitive action of $\psl{2}{q}$ with point stabilizers conjugate to $\mathbb{Z}_r$, where $r\mid \frac{q-1}{2}$ is an odd prime, we show that the auxiliary graph is not regular, and we construct an intersecting set which is sometimes of maximum size.</description>

      <title>Maximal sets of mutually orthogonal frequency squares and Doehlert-Klee designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binary frequency square of type $(n;\lambda_0,\lambda_1)$ is a $(0,1)$-matrix of order $n$ with $\lambda_0$ zeros and $\lambda_1$ ones in each row and in each column. Two such squares are orthogonal if there are exactly $\lambda_1^2$ cells where both squares contain ones. A set of binary MOFS is a set of binary frequency squares in which each pair is orthogonal. A set of binary MOFS of type $(n;\lambda_0,\lambda_1)$ is type maximal if there is no square of the type $(n;\lambda_0,\lambda_1)$ that is orthogonal to every square in the set.
  A Doehlert-Klee design consists of points $V$ and blocks $B$, where every pair of points occurs in precisely $\Lambda$ blocks and every point occurs in precisely $R$ blocks, where $R^2=\Lambda|B|$. We show that sets of binary MOFS are equivalent to a particular kind of Doehlert-Klee design. In a distinct application, Doehlert-Klee designs can also be used to construct sets of binary MOFS that are cyclically generated from their first rows. We use these connections to find new constructions for sets of type-maximal binary MOFS.</description>

      <title>Bumpless Pipe Dream Fragments -- Equivariant Geometry of Clans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new geometric setting for bumpless pipe dreams and double Schubert polynomials. We introduce the notion of bumpless pipe dream fragments, and define clan polynomials as their weight generating functions. It turns out that clan polynomials arise naturally in the equivariant geometry of ($GL_p\times GL_q$)-orbits over the flag variety $Fl_{p+q}$ parametrized by $(p,q)$-clans. Furthermore, we show that the coefficients in the equivariant Schubert expansion of the fundamental classes of ($GL_p\times GL_q$)-orbit closures are exactly clan polynomials, which resolves an open problem posed by Wyser and Yong.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{ EA}(q)$-additive Steiner 2-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A design is $G$-additive with $G$ an abelian group, if its points are in $G$ and each block is zero-sum in $G$. All the few known ``manageable" additive Steiner 2-designs are $\mathrm{EA}(q)$-additive for a suitable $q$, where $\mathrm{EA}(q)$ is the elementary abelian group of order $q$. We present some general constructions for $\mathrm{EA}(q)$-additive Steiner 2-designs which unify the known ones and allow to find a few new ones: an additive $\mathrm{EA}(2^8)$-additive 2-$(52,4,1)$ design which is also resolvable, and three pairwise non-isomorphic $\mathrm{EA}(3^5)$-additive 2-$(121,4,1)$ designs, none of which is the point-line design of $\mathrm{PG}(4,3)$. In the attempt to find also an $\mathrm{EA}(2^9)$-additive 2-$(511,7,1)$ design, we prove that a putative 2-analog of a 2-$(9,3,1)$ design cannot be cyclic.</description>

      <title>Constructing Hall-Littlewood Functions via a Deformation of the Bernstein Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bernstein operator $\mathbf{B}_n$ acts on a Schur function $S_\lambda$ by appending a part to the index, i.e., $\mathbf{B}_n S_\lambda=S_{(n,\lambda)}$. This provides a method of constructing the vertex operator representation of Schur functions since its homogeneous components are essentially just these Bernstein operators. Meanwhile, the Hall-Littlewood functions are an important generalization of the Schur functions, and they also have a vertex operator representation due to Jing. In this paper, we construct a $t$-analogue of the Bernstein operator, which allows for an explicit construction of the Jing operator. We show that the usual involution $\omega$ is fundamental to this construction, revealing further combinatorial structure. As an application, we use this vertex operator to prove stability of certain structure coefficients, including the Hall polynomials.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers of grid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let the grid graph $G_{M\times N}$ denote the Cartesian product $K_M \square K_N$. For a fixed subgraph $H$ of a grid, we study the off-diagonal Ramsey number $\operatorname{gr}(H, K_k)$, which is the smallest $N$ such that any red/blue edge coloring of $G_{N\times N}$ contains either a red copy of $H$ (a copy must preserve each edge's horizontal/vertical orientation), or a blue copy of $K_k$ contained inside a single row or column. Conlon, Fox, Mubayi, Suk, Verstra\"ete, and the first author recently showed that such grid Ramsey numbers are closely related to off-diagonal Ramsey numbers of bipartite $3$-uniform hypergraphs, and proved that $2^{\Omega(\log ^2 k)} \le \operatorname{gr}(G_{2\times 2}, K_k) \le 2^{O(k^{2/3}\log k)}$. We prove that the square $G_{2\times 2}$ is exceptional in this regard, by showing that $\operatorname{gr}(C,K_k) = k^{O_C(1)}$ for any cycle $C \ne G_{2\times 2}$. We also obtain that a larger class of grid subgraphs $H$ obtained via a recursive blowup procedure satisfies $\operatorname{gr}(H,K_k) = k^{O_H(1)}$. Finally, we show that conditional on the multicolor Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture, $\operatorname{gr}(H,K_k) = k^{O_H(1)}$ for any $H$ with two rows that does not contain $G_{2\times 2}$.</description>

      <title>On the enumeration of connected sets in finite lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected set in a graph is a nonempty subset of vertices whose induced subgraph is connected. In an infinite lattice, a connected set is often referred to as a lattice animal, whose enumeration up to isomorphism is a classical problem in both combinatorics and statistical physics. In this paper, we focus on the enumeration of connected sets in finite lattice graphs, providing a link between combinatorial counting and structural connectivity in the system.
  For any positive integers $m,n$, let $N(P_m\times P_n)$ and $N(C_m\times P_n)$ denote the number of all connected sets in the $(m\times n)$-lattice graph and $(m\times n)$-cylindrical lattice graph, respectively. In 2020, Vince derived enumeration formulas for $N(P_m\times P_2)$ and $N(C_m\times P_2)$, and highlighted the increasing difficulty of extending these calculation results to larger (cylindrical) lattice graphs. Recently, the authors of this paper have developed a method based on multi-step recurrence formulas to obtain enumeration results for $N(P_m\times P_n)$ with $m\le 4$. In this article, we apply a similar approach to derive the enumeration formula for $N(C_m\times P_n)$ with $m\le 7$. Further, for the general case, we establish an explicit and tight lower bound on the number of connected sets in any Cartesian product graph with the path of order $n$ as a factor, by employing the transfer matrix method on a subclass of connected sets. Based on this, corresponding asymptotic analysis is provided for some lattice graphs and other graphs of this type as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Reliability evaluation of Cayley graph generated by unicyclic graphs based on cyclic fault pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph connectivity serves as a fundamental metric for evaluating the reliability and fault tolerance of interconnection networks. To more precisely characterize network robustness, the concept of cyclic connectivity has been introduced, requiring that there are at least two components containing cycles after removing the vertex set. This property ensures the preservation of essential cyclic communication structures under faulty conditions. Cayley graphs exhibit several ideal properties for interconnection networks, which permits identical routing protocols at all vertices, facilitates recursive constructions, and ensures operational robustness. In this paper, we investigate the cyclic connectivity of Cayley graphs generated by unicyclic triangle free graphs. Given an symmetric group $Sym(n)$ on $\left\{ 1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ and a set $\mathcal{T}$ of transpositions of $Sym(n)$. Let $G(\mathcal{T})$ be the graph on vertex set $\left\{ 1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ and edge set $\left\{ij\colon(ij)\in \mathcal{T}\right\}$. If $G(\mathcal{T})$ is a unicyclic triangle free graphs, then denoted the Cayley graph Cay$(Sym(n),\mathcal{T})$ by $UG_{n}$. As a result, we determine the exact value of cyclic connectivity of $UG_{n}$ as $\kappa_{c}(UG_{n})=4n-8$ for $n\ge 4 $.</description>

      <title>Exact Tur\'{a}n numbers of two vertex-disjoint paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tur\'{a}n number of a graph $H$ is the maximum number of edges in any graph of order $n$ that does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. In 1959, Erd\H os and Gallai obtained a sharp upper bound of Tur\'{a}n numbers for a path of arbitrary length. In 1975, Faudree and Schelp, and independently in 1977, Kopylov determined the exact values of Tur\'an numbers of paths with arbitrary length. In this paper, we determine the Tur\'{a}n number of two vertex-disjoint paths of odd order at least 4. Together with previous works, we determine the exact Tur\'an numbers of two vertex-disjoint paths completely. This confirms the first $k=2$ case of a conjecture proposed by Yuan and Zhang in 2021, which generalizes the Tur\'an number formula of paths due to Faudree-Schelp, and Kopylov in a broader setting. Our main tools include a refinement of P\'{o}sa's rotation lemma, a stability result of Kopylov's theorem on cycles, and a recent inequality on circumference, minimum degree, and clique number of a 2-connected graph.</description>

      <title>On acyclic b-chromatic number of cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. An acyclic $k$-coloring of $G$ is a map $c:V(G)\rightarrow \{1,\dots,k\}$ such that $c(u)\neq c(v)$ for any $uv\in E(G)$ and the subgraph induced by the vertices of any two colors $i,j\in \{1,\dots,k\}$ is a forest. If every vertex $v$ of a color class $V_i$ misses a color $\ell_v\in\{1,\dots,k\}$ in its closed neighborhood, then every $v\in V_i$ can be recolored with $\ell_v$ and we obtain a $(k-1)$-coloring of $G$. If a new coloring $c'$ is also acyclic, then such a recoloring is an acyclic recoloring step and $c'$ is in relation $\triangleleft_a$ with $c$. The acyclic b-chromatic number $A_b(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum number of colors in an acyclic coloring where no acyclic recoloring step is possible. Equivalently, it is the maximum number of colors in a minimum element of the transitive closure of $\triangleleft_a$. In this paper, we consider $A_b(G)$ of cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>On removable edge subsets in graphs with a nowhere-zero $4$-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $R\subseteq E(G)$ of a graph $G$ is $k$-removable if $G-R$ has a nowhere-zero $k$-flow. We prove that every graph $G$ admitting a nowhere-zero $4$-flow has a $3$-removable subset consisting of at most $\frac{1}{6}|E(G)|$ edges. This gives a positive answer to a conjecture of M. DeVos, J. McDonald, I. Pivotto, E. Rollov\'a and R. \v{S}\'amal [$3$-Flows with large support, J. Comb. Theory Ser. B 144 (2020), 32-80] in the case of graphs admitting a nowhere-zero $4$-flow.
  Moreover, Hoffmann-Ostenhof recently conjectured that every cubic graph with a nowhere-zero $4$-flow has a $4$-removable edge. Bipartite cubic graphs verify this conjecture. Our result gives an approximation for Hoffmann-Ostenhof's Conjecture in the non-bipartite case.
  Finally, for cubic graphs, our result implies that every $3$-edge-colorable cubic graph $G$ contains a subgraph $H$ whose connected components are either cycles or subdivisions of bipartite cubic graphs, such that $|E(H)|\ge \frac{5}{6}|E(G)|$.</description>

Abstract: An association scheme on triples (AST) is a three-dimensional analogue of a classical association scheme. Similar to how a transitive group action produces a Schurian classical association scheme, a two-transitive group action produces an AST. This paper describes the relations and intersection numbers of ASTs from the finite unitary groups acting on the respective isotropic lines.</description>

      <title>A Complete Classification of Ideal Chomp Games on Low-Rank Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely classify winning strategies in the Ideal Chomp Game played on $\bar{K}$-algebras R of rank at most 6. In this two-player combinatorial game, players alternately add generators to build an ideal inside a given ring R, with the player who builds an ideal equal to the entire ring losing. We prove that player A has a winning strategy on all $\bar{K}$-algebras R up to rank 6 except for five specific cases: $\bar{K}$ itself, $\bar{K}[x, y]/(x, y)^2$, and three other local algebras. Our methods combine game-theoretic analysis with the structure theory of Artinian rings and computational verification. We also discuss a classical result of Henson on winning strategies in the Ideal Chomp Game, as well as ideas and open questions about the Ideal Chomp Game on higher-dimensional $\bar{K}$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Chow classes of arbitrary matroids in the Grassmannian. We develop a new combinatorial approach for computing them, by first focusing on snake matroids and then extending our results via valuativity to any matroid. Our main contribution identifies the Poincar\'e dual of the Chow class of a snake matroid with a specific ribbon Schur function, providing an explicit formula for its coefficients in the Schubert basis as the number of standard Young tableaux of a given shape with a prescribed descent set. As consequences, we recover and simplify classical results such as Klyachko's formula for uniform matroids, Gessel and Viennot's enumeration of permutations with fixed descent sets, and formulas for the volume of lattice path matroids. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of our findings by proving that certain Schubert coefficients are positive for all connected paving matroids.</description>

      <title>Maximal bipartite graphs with a unique minimum dominating set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, Fischermann et al. considered the maximum size of \textit{uniquely-dominatable} graphs, graphs whose dominating number is realized only by a unique dominating set. They conjectured a size bound and provide a general graph construction that shows the bound is tight \cite{Original_Paper}. In 2010, Shank and Fraboni prove Fischermann's bound is true when $\gamma = 2$ \cite{Shank_paper}. In this paper, we observe how Fischermann's bound changes if we impart a different restriction on a graph -- bipartiteness. We conjecture a bound on the maximum number of edges possible for uniquely-dominatable bipartite graphs. We provide constructions to demonstrate this bound is tight. We prove our bipartite bound is true for the $\gamma = 2$ and $n = 3\gamma$ cases. We also discuss perfect domination and how it relates to our extremal graph constructions. We provide constructions that meet both Fischermann's bound for all graphs and our bound for bipartite graphs respectively, both of which are perfectly dominated.</description>

As an application, we derive a spectral bound on the toughness of directed graphs that generalizes Alon's bound for $k$-regular graphs, showing how structural properties of directed graphs can be captured through their asymmetric spectra.</description>

      <title>Quasi-majority neighbor sum distinguishing edge-colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a $k$-edge-coloring of $G$ is any mapping $c:E(G)\longrightarrow [k]$. The edge-coloring $c$ of $G$ naturally defines a vertex-coloring $\sigma_{c}: V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$, where $\sigma_{c}(v)=\sum_{u\in N_G(v)}c(vu)$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. The edge-coloring $c$ is said to be neighbor sum distinguishing if it results in a proper vertex-coloring $\sigma_{c}$, which that $\sigma_{c}(u) \neq \sigma_{c}(v)$ for every edge $uv$ in $G$.
  We investigate neighbor sum distinguishing edge-colorings with local constraints, where the edge-coloring is quasi-majority at each vertex. Specifically, every vertex $v$ is incident to at most $\left\lceil d(v)/2 \right\rceil$ edges of one color. This type of coloring is referred to as quasi-majority neighbor sum distinguishing edge-coloring. The minimum number of colors required for a graph to have a quasi-majority neighbor sum distinguishing edge-coloring is called the quasi-majority neighbor sum distinguishing index. A graph is nice if it has no component isomorphic to $K_2$. We prove that any nice graph admits a quasi-majority neighbor sum distinguishing edge-coloring using at most 12 colors. This bound can be improved for bipartite graphs and graphs with a maximum degree of at most 4. Specifically, we show that every nice bipartite graph can be colored with 6 colors, and every nice graph with a maximum degree of at most 4 can be colored with 7 colors. Additionally, we determine the exact value of the quasi-majority neighbor sum distinguishing index for complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and trees.
  We also consider majority neighbor sum distinguishing edge-colorings, that is, when each vertex is incident to at most $d(v)/2$ edges with the same color.</description>

      <title>Structure and geometry of the tableaux algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the monoid algebra ${}_{n}\mathcal{T}_{m}$ of semistandard Young tableaux, which coincides with the Gelfand--Tsetlin semigroup ring $\mathcal{GT}_{n}$ when $m = n$. Among others, we show that this algebra is commutative, Noetherian, reduced, Koszul, and Cohen--Macaulay. We provide a complete classification of its maximal ideals and compute the topology of its maximal spectrum. Furthermore, we classify its irreducible modules and provide a faithful semisimple representation. We also establish that its associated variety coincides with a toric degeneration of certain partial flag varieties constructed by Gonciulea--Lakshmibai. As an application, we show that this algebra yields injective embeddings of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-crystals, extending a result of Bossinger--Torres.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the Longest Increasing Subsequence in Random Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a uniformly random permutation of $n$ elements. We rely on the Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence, Young tableaux, and key classical results -- including the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem and the Hook Length Formula -- to demonstrate that the expected LIS length grows as $2\sqrt{n}$. We review the essential variational principles of Logan--Shepp and Vershik--Kerov, which determine the limiting shape of the associated random Young diagrams, and summarize the Baik--Deift--Johansson theorem that links fluctuations of the LIS length to the Tracy--Widom distribution. Our approach focuses on providing conceptual and intuitive explanations of these results, unifying classical proofs into a single narrative and supplying fresh visual examples, while referring the reader to the original literature for detailed proofs and rigorous arguments.</description>

      <title>An orthogonal bimodule decomposition of quantized tensor space realizing Jimbo's Schur--Weyl duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the vector representation $V_q$ of the quantized enveloping algebra $\mathbf{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. For $q$ generic, Jimbo showed that $q$-tensor space $V_q^{\otimes r}$ satisfies Schur--Weyl duality for the commuting actions of $\mathbf{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and the Iwahori--Hecke algebra $\mathbf{H}_q(\mathfrak{S}_r)$, with the latter action derived from the $R$-matrix. In the limit as $q \to 1$, one recovers classical Schur--Weyl duality.
  We give a combinatorial realization of the corresponding isotypic semisimple decomposition of $V_q^{\otimes r}$ indexed by paths in the Bratteli diagram. This extends earlier work (\emph{Journal of Algebra} 2024) of the first two authors for the $n=2$ case. Our construction works over any field containing a non-zero element $q$ which is not a root of unity.</description>

      <title>Cutting plane methods with gradient-based heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cutting plane methods, particularly outer approximation, are a well-established approach for solving nonlinear discrete optimization problems without relaxing the integrality of decision variables. While powerful in theory, their computational performance can be highly variable. Recent research has shown that constructing cutting planes at the projection of infeasible points onto the feasible set can significantly improve the performance of cutting plane approaches. Motivated by this, we examine whether constructing cuts at feasible points closer to the optimal solution set could further enhance the effectiveness of cutting plane methods. We propose a hybrid method that combines the global convergence guarantees of cutting plane methods with the local exploration capabilities of first-order optimization techniques. Specifically, we use projected gradient methods as a heuristic to identify promising regions of the solution space and generate tighter, more informative cuts. We focus on binary optimization problems with convex differentiable objective functions, where projection operations can be efficiently computed via mixed-integer linear programming. By constructing cuts at points closer to the optimal solution set and eliminating non-optimal regions, the algorithm achieves better approximation of the feasible region and faster convergence. Numerical experiments confirm that our approach improves both the quality of the solution and computational efficiency across different solver configurations. This framework provides a flexible foundation for further extensions to more general discrete domains and offers a promising heuristic to the toolkit for nonlinear discrete optimization.</description>

Abstract: We study vanishing theorems of tautological bundles in the sense of Berget--Eur--Spink--Tseng restricted to wonderful varieties. As an application, we prove a characteristic-independent analogue of Brieskorn's result on cohomology of arrangement complements, in addition to a comparison theorem between Orlik--Solomon algebra and the logarithmic de Rham cohomology of wonderful varieties. In a different direction, we extend a vanishing theorem of Borel--Weil--Bott type for tautological bundles. Finally, we reduce the weak version of White's basis conjecture to a problem about cohomology vanishing of tautological bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01071v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction problem in the case where the transmitted codeword is chosen from $\{0,1\}^n$ and the channel can delete up to $t$ symbols from the transmitted codeword. We determine the minimum number of channel outputs (assuming that they are distinct) required to reconstruct a list of size $\ell-1$ of candidate sequences, one of which corresponds to the original transmitted sequence. More specifically, we determine the maximum possible size of the intersection of $\ell \geq 3$ deletion balls of radius $t$ centered at $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{\ell}$, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}^n$ for all $i \in \{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ and $x_i \neq x_j$ for $i \neq j$, with $n \geq t+ \ell-1$ and $t \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>A curiously slowly mixing Markov chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Markov chain with very different mixing rates depending on how mixing is measured. The chain is the "Burnside process on the hypercube $C_2^n$." Started at the all-zeros state, it mixes in a bounded number of steps, no matter how large $n$ is, in $\ell^1$ and in $\ell^2$. And started at general $x$, it mixes in at most $\log n$ steps in $\ell^1$. But, in $\ell^2$, it takes $\frac{n}{\log n}$ steps for most starting $x$. An interesting connection to Schur--Weyl duality between $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and $S_n$ further allows for analysis of the mixing time from arbitrary starting states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the $directed$ $normalizing$ $graph$ associated with a group $G$, defined as the simple directed graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$, with an arrow from $x$ to $y$ whenever the subgroup $\langle x \rangle$ is normal in $\langle x, y \rangle$. Our analysis focuses on the set of bidirectional universal vertices and, in particular, on the induced subgraph obtained by removing them, where the most interesting connectivity phenomena occur. We characterize the groups for which this induced subgraph is strongly connected and determine bounds for its diameter. Finally, we show how properties of this graph reflect algebraic features of the underlying group.</description>

      <title>Percolation on graphs of polynomial growth is local: analyticity, supercritical sharpness, isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate locality of the supercritical regime for Bernoulli percolation on transitive graphs with polynomial growth, by which we mean the following. Take a transitive graph of polynomial growth $\mathscr{G}$ satisfying $p_c(\mathscr{G})&lt;1$ and take $p&gt;p_c(\mathscr{G})$. Let $\mathscr{H}$ be another such graph and assume that $\mathscr{G}$ and $\mathscr{H}$ have the same ball of radius $r$ for $r$ large. We prove that various quantities regarding percolation of parameter close to $p$ on $\mathscr{H}$ can be well understood from $(\mathscr{G},p)$ alone.
  This includes uniform versions of supercritical sharpness as well as the Kesten-Zhang bound on the probability of observing a large finite cluster: the constants involved can be chosen to depend only on $(\mathscr{G},p)$. We also prove that $\theta_\mathscr{H}$ is an analytic function of $p$ in the whole supercritical regime and that, for a suitable $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\mathscr{G},p)&gt;0$, the analytic extension of $\theta_\mathscr{H}$ to the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $p$ in $\mathbb C$ is, uniformly, well approximated by the analytic extension of $\theta_\mathscr{G}$. The proof relies on new results on the connectivity of minimal cutsets; in particular, we answer a question asked by Babson and Benjamini in 1999. We further discuss connections with the conjecture of non-percolation at criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \textbf{double-change covering design} (DCCD) is a $v$-set $V$ and an ordered list $\mathcal{L}$ of $b$ blocks of size $k$ where every pair from $V$ must occur in at least one block and each pair of consecutive blocks differs by exactly two elements. It is \textbf{minimal} if it has the fewest block possible and \textbf{circular} when the first and last blocks also differ by two elements. We give a recursive construction that uses 1-factorizations and expansion sets to construct a DCCD($v+\frac{v+k-2}{k-2},k,b+\frac{v}{k-2}\frac{v+k-2}{2k-4}$) from a DCCD($v,k,b$). We construct circular DCCD($2k-2,k,k-1$) and circular DCCD($2k-3,k,k-2$) from single change covering designs and determine minimal DCCD when $v=2k-2$. We use difference methods to construct five infinite families of minimal circular DCCD($c(4k-6)+1,k,c^2(4k-6)+c$) when $c\leq 5$ for any $k\geq 3$. The recursive construction is then used to build twelve additional minimal DCCD from members of these infinite families. Finally the difference method is used to construct a minimal circular DCCD(61,4,366).</description>

      <title>Baker--Bowler theory for Lagrangian Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baker and Bowler showed that the Grassmannian can be defined over a tract, a field-like structure generalizing both partial fields and hyperfields. This notion unifies theories of matroids over partial fields, valuated matroids, and oriented matroids. We extend Baker--Bowler theory to the Lagrangian Grassmannian which is the set of maximal isotropic subspaces in a $2n$-dimensional symplectic vector space. By Boege et al., the Lagrangian Grassmannian is parameterized as a subset of the projective space of dimension $2^{n-2}(4+\binom{n}{2})-1$ and its image is cut out by certain quadrics. We simplify a list of quadrics so that these are apparently induced by the Laplace expansions only concerning principal and almost-principal minors of a symmetric matrix. From the idea that the strong basis exchange axiom of matroids captures the combinatorial essence of the Grassmann--Pl\"{u}cker relations, we define matroid-like objects, called antisymmetric matroids, derived from the quadrics for the Lagrangian Grassmannian. We also provide a cryptomorphic definition in terms of circuits capturing the orthogonality and maximality of a Lagrangian subspace. We define antisymmetric matroids over tracts in two equivalent ways, which generalize both BB theory and the parameterization of the Lagrangian Grassmannian. It provides a new perspective on the Lagrangian Grassmannian over hyperfields such as the tropical hyperfield and the sign hyperfield. Our proof involves a homotopy theorem for graphs associated with antisymmetric matroids, which generalizes Maurer's homotopy theorem for matroids. We also prove that if a point in the projective space satisfies the $3$-/$4$-term quadratic relations for the Lagrangian Grassmannian and its supports form the bases of an antisymmetric matroid, then it satisfies all quadratic relations, a result motivated by the earlier work of Tutte for matroids and the Grassmannian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct classes of graphs that are variants of the so-called layered wheel. One of their key properties is that while the treewidth is bounded by a function of the clique number, the construction can be adjusted to make the dependance grow arbitrarily. Some of these classes provide counter-examples to several conjectures. In particular, the construction includes hereditary classes of graphs whose treewidth is bounded by a function of the clique number while the tree-independence number is unbounded, thus disproving a conjecture of Dallard, Milani\v{c} and \v{S}torgel [Treewidth versus clique number. II. Tree-independence number. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 164:404-442, 2024.]. The construction can be further adjusted to provide, for any fixed integer $c$, graphs of arbitrarily large treewidth that contain no $K_c$-free graphs of high treewidth, thus disproving a conjecture of Hajebi [Chordal graphs, even-hole-free graphs and sparse obstructions to bounded treewidth, arXiv:2401.01299, 2024].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate shift-invariant transformations, also known as rotation-symmetric vectorial Boolean functions, on $n$ bits that are induced from Boolean functions on $k$ bits, for $k\leq n$. We consider such transformations that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some sense, almost bijective, and study their cryptographic properties. In this context, we define an almost lifting as a Boolean function for which there is an upper bound on the number of collisions of its induced transformation that does not depend on $n$. We show that if a Boolean function with diameter $k$ is an almost lifting, then the maximum number of collisions of its induced transformation is $2^{k-1}$ for any $n$. Moreover, we search for functions in the class of almost liftings that have good cryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not cause major security weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map $\chi$ used in the Keccak hash function.</description>

      <title>Gamma vectors as inverted Chebyshev expansions, type A to B transformations, and connections to algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a reciprocal/palindromic polynomial of even degree, we show that the gamma vector is essentially given by an inverted Chebyshev polynomial basis expansion. As an immediate consequence, we characterize real-rootedness of a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials in terms of real-rootedness of that of the reciprocal polynomial built out of an inverted scaled tuple of the coefficients with one fixed and the rest divided by 2. It can be taken as a counterpart for arbitrary dimensions of a recent result of Bel-Afia--Meroni--Telen on hyperbolicity of Chebyshev curves with respect to the origin. In general, Chebyshev varieties serve as a counterpart of toric varieties in sparse polynomial root finding. Apart from this, the inverted Chebyshev expansion also yields connections between intrinsic properties of the gamma vector construction and the geometric combinatorics of simplicial complexes and posets.
  We find this by applying work of Hetyei on Tchebyshev subdivisions and Tchebyshev posets. In particular, we find that the gamma vector transformation is closely related to $f$-vectors of simplicial complexes resulting from successive edge subdivisions that transform the type A Coxeter complex to the type B Coxeter complex. Lifting to this to a modification of $cd$-indices, we show that the gamma vector inverted Chebyshev polynomial expansion lifts to a sum of (subdivisions of) cross polytopes which can be computed using (topological) descent statistics. While there are many examples where gamma positivity involving descent statistics, it is interesting to note we only assume the input polynomial is reciprocal/palindromic. Finally, Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind from derivatives give connections to Hopf algebras and quasisymmetric functions along with Lefschetz-type maps induced by $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representations.</description>

      <title>An asymmetric version of Elekes-Szab\'o via group actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider when finite families $F \subseteq \mathbb{C}[t]$ of bounded degree polynomials, or more generally of bounded complexity finite-to-finite correspondences on $\mathbb{C}$, can exhibit non-expansion of the form $|F(A)| = O(|A|^{1+\eta})$ in their actions on finite sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ with $|F| \gg |A|^\eps \gg 1$, for a fixed $\eps&gt;0$ and arbitrarily small $\eta&gt;0$. Our conclusions generalise the Elekes-R\'onyai and Elekes-Szab\'o theorems, which correspond to the case that $F$ is parametrised by a single complex variable and $|F|=|A|$. Our result also applies to families of correspondences between varieties of arbitrary dimension if we impose a general position assumption on $A$. In all cases, the conclusion is that a commutative algebraic group structure is responsible. As a special case, we obtain asymmetric versions of Elekes-R\'onyai and Elekes-Szab\'o, with explicit bounds on exponents. Our methods originate in model theory.</description>

      <title>Flag complex face structures and decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most common and effective methods of obtaining structural information on simplicial complexes is to use tools from algebraic geometry/commutative algebra (often motivated by properties of toric varieties). However, there is no general algebro-geometric description of components of the gamma vector holding for arbitary flag simplicial spheres. This invariant occurs in many different contexts including permutation statistics, signatures of toric varieties, and Euler characteristics of nonpositively curved piecewise Euclidean manifolds. Combinatorial methods resulting from an explicit inverted Chebyshev expansion give rise to new positivity properties and cell complex structures that are of interest in their own right. Note that the focus is on the $f$-vector rather than the $h$-vector in ``algebraic'' settings. For flag simplicial spheres $\Delta$, the fact that $h(\Delta) = f(\Gamma)$ and compatibility between Chebyshev expansions and a modification of the $f$-polynomial by work of Hetyei are the key inputs. In the main formula implying new positivity results, local structures of $CAT(0)$ complexes and cubical analogues of barycentric subdivisions give deeper connections with cubical complex structures complementing earlier work related to the top gamma vector component. Afterwards, we return to the motivating example of barycentric subdivisions and consider how $f$-vectors of Cohen--Macaulay and vertex decomposable flag complexes in geometric settings decompose and interact with geometric transformations. This includes subdivisions of simplicial complexes and recursive properties they share with vertex decomposable flag complexes.</description>

Abstract: Various algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all connected induced subgraphs of a graph $G=(V,E)$. As a variation we enumerate all "packings of connected sets", i.e. partitions $\Pi$ of $V$ with the property that each part of $\Pi$ induces a connected subgraph. More generally, for various types $T$ of graphs we do (one or both of) the following: (i) enumerate all type $T$ (induced) subgraphs of a given graph $G$, or (ii) enumerate all packings of type $T$ subgraphs of $G$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several interrelated notions of discrete curvature on graphs. Many approaches utilize the optimal transportation metric on its probability simplex or the distance matrix of the graph. In this survey article, we compute formulas for three different types of curvature on graphs. Along the way, we obtain a comparison result for the curvatures under consideration, a degree-diameter theorem for trees, and a combinatorial identity for certain sums of distances on trees.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees of claw-free graphs with few leaves and branch vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree. A vertex of degree one is a \emph{leaf} of $T$ and a vertex of degree at least three is a \emph{branch vertex} of $T$. A graph is said to be claw-free if it does not contain $K_{1,3}$ as an induced subgraph. In this paper, we study the spanning trees with a bounded number of leaves and branch vertices of claw-free graphs. Applying the main results, we also give some improvements of previous results on the spanning trees with few branch vertices for the case of claw-free graphs.</description>

      <title>The minimum edge-pancyclic graph of a given order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ of order $n$ is called edge-pancyclic if, for every integer $k$ with $3 \leq k \leq n$, every edge of $G$ lies in a cycle of length $k$. Determining the minimum size $f(n)$ of a simple edge-pancyclic graph with $n$ vertices seems difficult. Recently, Li, Liu and Zhan \cite{li2024minimum} gave both a lower bound and an upper bound of $f(n)$. In this paper, we improve their lower bound by considering a new class of graphs and improve the upper bound by constructing a family of edge-pancyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. We conventionally set $k = 1$ when $G$ is $2$-edge-connected. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $k &lt; N-n$. A \textit{configuration} of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A \textit{move} is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The {\it pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$} is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. Let $\D(G)$ denote the diameter of the graph $G$, and let $\CL(G)$ denote the maximum length of a shortest cycle containing a vertex $v$, taken over all vertices $v$ in all $2$-connected components of $G$. For completeness, we define $\CL(G) := 1$ when $G$ is a tree. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problem on a pair $(G, P)$ is in $\Ord\left(n\D(G) + \min\left\{k n \D(G),\ n^{2} \log\big(1+\min\{n, k\}\big)\right\}\right)$ if $G$ is an $N$-vertex tree, and in $\Ord\left(n\D(G)+\frac{n^2\min\{n,\CL(G)\}}{N-n}+n^2\log(1+\min\{n, N-n\})\right)$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. Furthermore, in the case where $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph and the number of unoccupied spaces $N - n$ is bounded by some constant, this length admits an upper bound of $\Ord(n \CL(G) \D(G))$.

      <title>Digraph-defined external difference families and new circular external difference families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: External difference families (EDFs) are combinatorial objects which were introduced in the early 2000s, motivated by information security applications such as the construction of AMD codes. Various generalizations have since been defined and investigated, in particular strong external difference families (SEDFs) and circular external difference families (CEDFs). In this paper, we present a framework based on graphs and digraphs which offers a new unified way to view these structures, and leads to natural new research questions. We present constructions and structural results about these digraph-defined EDFs, and we obtain new explicit constructions for infinite families of CEDFs, in particular $(ml^2+1,m,l,1)$-CEDFs. Our techniques include cyclotomy in finite fields and direct constructions in cyclic groups and direct products of cyclic groups. We construct the first infinite family of such CEDFs in non-cyclic abelian groups; these have odd values of $m$ and $l$. We also present the first CEDF in a non-abelian group.</description>

      <title>Poset saturation of unions of chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{G}$ of sets is a(n induced) copy of a poset $P=(P,\leqslant)$ if there exists a bijection $b:P\rightarrow \mathcal{G}$ such that $p\leqslant q$ holds if and only if $b(p)\subseteq b(q)$. The induced saturation number sat$^*(n,P)$ is the minimum size of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ that does not contain any copy of $P$, but for any $G\in 2^{[n]}\setminus \mathcal{F}$, the family $\mathcal{F}\cup \{G\}$ contains a copy of $P$. We consider sat$^*(n,P)$ for posets $P$ that are formed by pairwise incomparable chains, i.e. $P=\bigoplus_{j=1}^mC_{i_j}$. We make the following two conjectures: (i) sat$^*(n,P)=O(n)$ for all such posets and (ii) sat$^*(n,P)=O(1)$ if not all chains are of the same size. (The second conjecture is known to hold if there is a unique longest among the chains.) We verify these conjectures in some special cases: we prove (i) if all chains are of the same length, we prove (ii) in the first unknown general case: for posets $2C_k+C_1$. Finally, we give an infinite number of examples showing that (ii) is not a necessary condition for sat$^*(n,P)=O(1)$ among posets $P=\bigoplus_{j=1}^mC_{i_j}$: we prove sat$^*(n,(\binom{2t}{t}+1)C_2)=O(1)$ for all $t\ge 1$.</description>

Abstract: A path system in a graph $G$ is a collection of paths, with exactly one path between any two vertices in $G$. A path system is said to be consistent if it is intersection-closed. We show that the number of consistent path systems on $n$ vertices is $n^{\frac{n^2}{2}(1-o(1))}$, whereas the number of consistent path systems which are realizable as the unique geodesics w.r.t. some metric is only $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$.
  In addition, these insights allow us to improve known bounds on the face-count of the metric cone and shed new light on enumerating maximum-VC-classes.</description>

      <title>A scheme-theoretic interpretation of generalized splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical splines feature prominently in approximation theory and numerical analysis, while GKM theory arises in the study of equivariant cohomology. More recently, generalized splines have been studied which simultaneously generalize both classical splines and GKM theory. We show that generalized splines can be understood as a scheme-theoretic phenomenon, and establish the foundations for working with generalized splines via scheme theory. To do this, we first prove that the ring of generalized splines over an edge-labeled graph is isomorphic to the limit of a diagram associated to the edge-labeled graph. This is used to establish the connection to scheme theory, and in particular to secure a local--global principle for generalized splines.
  The secondary aim of the paper is to catalog a variety of initial local--global results. We prove a module of multivariate generalized splines over $k[x,y]$ is free when an edge-labeled graph is locally trivial or determined by a cycle on a standard cover, provide criteria for generalized splines over UFDs to be finite projective, for multivariate generalized splines to be free, along with other results. The appendix includes a variety of examples which demonstrate precise experimental control over when a module of splines is free, with computer verification by Macaulay2. We conclude with an account of how deletion and contraction affect the spectrum of a ring of splines.</description>

Abstract: We provide new results on combinatorial characterizations of covering properties in end spaces and ray spaces. In particular, we characterize the Lindel\"of degree, the extent, the Rothberger property, $\sigma$-compactness and the Menger property for ray, end and edge-end spaces. We show that $\sigma$-compactness and the Menger property are equivalent for these spaces, and that they are all $D$-spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of Adin, Alon and Roichman [arXiv:2502.14398, 2025] on the number of steps required to sort $n$ labelled points on a circle by transpositions. Imagine that the vertices of a cycle of length $n$ are labelled by the elements $1,\dots,n$. We are allowed to change this labelling by swapping the labels of any two vertices on the cycle. How many swaps are needed to obtain a labelling that has the elements $1,\dots,n$ in clockwise order?
  We provide evidence for their conjecture that at most $n-3$ transpositions are needed to sort a circular permutation when $n$ is not prime. We prove this conjecture when $2\mid n$ or $3\mid n$ and when restricting to permutations given by a polynomial over $\mathbb{Z}_n$. We also provide various algebraic constructions of circular permutations that take many transpositions to sort, most notably providing one that matches our upper bound when $n=3p$ for $p$ an odd prime, and disproving their second conjecture by providing non-affine circular permutations that require $n-2$ transpositions (for $n$ prime). We also improve the lower bounds for some sequences of composite numbers. Finally, we improve the bounds for small $n$ computationally. In particular, we prove a tight upper bound for $n=25$ via an exhaustive computer search using a new connection between this problem and strong complete mappings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-dimensional lattice polytope ${\mathcal Q}_\sigma$ can be associated to any composition $\sigma$ of a positive integer $n$, as a special case of constructions due to Pitman--Stanley and Chapoton. The entries of the $h$-vector of $\sigma$, introduced by Chapoton, enumerate the lattice points in ${\mathcal Q}_\sigma$ by the number of their zero coordinates. Chapoton conjectured that this vector is equal to the $h$-vector of a simplicial polytope. This paper proves that the $h$-vector of $\sigma$ is gamma-positive, hence palindromic and unimodal, and confirms certain other conjectures of Chapoton on the lattice point enumeration of composition polytopes. A combinatorial interpretation of their $h^\ast$-polynomials is deduced.</description>

      <title>Cellularity of KLR and weighted KLRW algebras via crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the weighted KLRW algebras of finite type, and their cyclotomic quotients, are cellular algebras. The cellular bases are explicitly described using crystal graphs. As a special case, this proves that the KLR algebras of finite type are cellular. As one application, we give explicit formulas for the graded decomposition numbers of the cyclotomic algebras in level one.</description>

      <title>Variations on a theme of Ap\'ery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ap\'ery's remarkable discovery of rapidly converging continued fractions with small coefficients for $\zeta(2)$ and $\zeta(3)$ has led to a flurry of important activity in an incredible variety of different directions. Our purpose is to show that modifications of Ap\'ery's continued fractions can give interesting results including new rapidly convergent continued fractions for certain interesting constants.</description>

      <title>Translating between the representations of an acyclic convex geometry of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of translating between irreducible closed sets and implicational bases in closure systems. To date, the complexity status of this problem is widely open, and it is further known to generalize the notorious hypergraph dualization problem, even in the context of acyclic convex geometries, i.e., closure systems admitting an acyclic implicational base. This paper studies this later class with a focus on the degree, which corresponds to the maximal number of implications in which an element occurs. We show that the problem is tractable for bounded values of this parameter, even when relaxed to the notions of premise- and conclusion-degree. Our algorithms rely on structural properties of acyclic convex geometries and involve various techniques from algorithmic enumeration such as solution graph traversal, saturation techniques, and a sequential approach leveraging from acyclicity. They are shown to perform in incremental-polynomial time. Finally, we complete these results by showing that our running times cannot be improved to polynomial delay using the standard framework of flashlight search.</description>

      <title>On a magneto-spectral invariant on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a magneto-spectral invariant for finite graphs. This invariant vanishes on trees and is maximized by complete graphs. We compute this invariant for cycles, complete graphs, wheel graphs, hypercubes, complete bipartite graphs and suspensions of trees and derive various lower and upper bounds. We discuss the behaviour of this invariant under various graph operations and investigate relations to the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Improvement of effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j&gt;L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j&gt;L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|&gt;1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>On the tangent bundle and the divisor theory of a general matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a loopless matroid $M$, we construct a $K$-class $T_M\in K(X_{M})$. When $M$ is realizable, $T_M$ recovers the $K$-class of the tangent bundle of the wonderful compactification $W_L$. We derive two formulas for the total Chern class of $T_M$ and prove that the associated Todd class agrees with the Todd class appearing in the matroid Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch formula. We define a "fake effective cone" so that big and nef divisors in a matroid can be characterized in a manner analogous to how the effective cone characterizes big and nef divisors in classical algebraic geometry. Finally, we define the classes $\beta_S$ and study their properties.</description>

      <title>The Graded Betti Numbers of the Skeletons of Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class $\mathcal{C}$ of squarefree monomial ideals $I\subseteq R=\mathbb{K}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ over a field $\mathbb{K}$, defined by the condition that $\dim R/I$ equals the maximum degree of the minimal generators of $I$ minus one. We show that the Stanley-Reisner ideal of every $i$-skeleton of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ belongs to $\mathcal{C}$ for all $-1\le i&lt;\dim\Delta$. To investigate their homological properties, we introduce the notion of a degree resolution and prove that every ideal in $\mathcal{C}$ possesses this property. Moreover, we show that every squarefree monomial ideal admits a truncation whose regularity coincides with that of the original ideal, thereby reducing the study of degree resolutions to that of linear resolutions. Finally, we provide an explicit formula describing the relationship between the graded Betti numbers of a simplicial complex and those of its skeletons.</description>

      <title>Modular Periodicity of Random Initialized Recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</description>
