      <title>Construction of a Small-Scale Vacuum Generation System and Using It as an Educational Device to Demonstrate Features of the Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a vacuum generation system composed of a reciprocating compressor (3 tons of refrigeration) with an inverted-function that is ready to be hooked flexibly to a gas-tight container to create an evacuated enclosed atmosphere, without strict limitation of the size of that container. The evacuated container (or vacuum chamber) can serve in different purposes such as educational demonstration of the vacuum properties, extraction of perfumes from herbal resources, and preserving food. We tested the device and found it can reach a vacuum level of 26 inches of mercury in an environment with an atmospheric pressure of 28.5 inches of mercury. We compared the performance of our vacuum device to a rotary-vane vacuum pump of 1/4 horsepowers and found that the vacuum pump reaches a set test vacuum level of 25 inches of mercury before the compressor. We then demonstrated experimentally some features of the vacuum using the inverted compressor or the vane vacuum pump. These experiments serve some topics in physics for school students as well as two core subjects of mechanical engineering, namely fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Mereological Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: from Macro to Micro with M\"obius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating macroscopic observables to microscopic interactions is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. While current approaches often focus on pairwise interactions, a complete understanding requires going beyond these to capture the full range of possible interactions. We present a unified mathematical formalism, based on the M\"obius inversion theorem, that reveals how different decompositions of a system into parts lead to different, but equally valid, microscopic theories. By providing an exact bridge between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions, this framework demonstrates that many existing notions of interaction, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally and uniquely arise from particular choices of system decomposition, or mereology. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights how the choice of decomposition fundamentally determines the nature of the resulting interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights across domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and enable the search for new notions of interaction. To illustrate the latter in practice, we decompose the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and show that our method correctly identifies which variables are responsible for the divergence. In addition, we use Rota's Galois connection theorem to describe coarse-grainings of mereologies, and efficiently derive the renormalised couplings of a 1D Ising model. Our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful and practical lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>
